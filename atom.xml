As Romanians ourselves, it was an honor to be able to represent the thriving tech scene in Romania alongside fellow tech innovators.</p><h3 id="Named-among-the-Best-Apps-of-2020-by-Huawei-in-the-“Best-for-Personal-Growth”-category"><a href="#Named-among-the-Best-Apps-of-2020-by-Huawei-in-the-“Best-for-Personal-Growth”-category" class="headerlink" title="Named among the Best Apps of 2020 by Huawei in the “Best for Personal Growth” category"></a>Named among the Best Apps of 2020 by Huawei in the “Best for Personal Growth” category</h3><p> Last but not least, another round of good news came from China.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="‘Mondly’-The-Gateway-to-Multilingual-Gaming-on-Oculus-Quest"><a href="#‘Mondly’-The-Gateway-to-Multilingual-Gaming-on-Oculus-Quest" class="headerlink" title="‘Mondly’: The Gateway to Multilingual Gaming on Oculus Quest"></a>‘Mondly’: The Gateway to Multilingual Gaming on Oculus Quest</h2><p><strong>BRASOV, Romania, October 26, 2021</strong>  – Mondly, one of the world’s leading online language learning platforms, recently launched the first language app in the Oculus Quest store. <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4214902388537196/"><em>Mondly: Practice Languages in VR</em></a>  brings language immersion into people’s homes and enables them to acquire valuable skills with practical application. Within a week of its official launch, Mondly VR became the Top Selling Educational App in the store, currently ranking as the #1 solution in VR Education.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Mondly VR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  uses Quest’s microphone to allow you to speak and then evaluates your delivery with the help of speech recognition. In addition to offering a memorable learning experience, <strong>Mondly VR also eliminates the effects of foreign language anxiety</strong>  and helps users refine their speaking skills without fear of embarrassment. Learners can practice real-life scenarios such as making a hotel reservation, taking a taxi, or ordering dinner.</p><p> After going through Oculus’ rigorous selection process, Mondly VR received major improvements to ensure the highest possible quality for Quest users. Featuring dynamic conversations, feedback on pronunciation, and intelligent suggestions, the app aims at being the closest experience to actual immersion.</p><p> With Mondly VR, users can practice 29 languages: English, Spanish, German, French, Italian, and more.</p><h2 id="VR-is-ready-to-disrupt-education"><a href="#VR-is-ready-to-disrupt-education" class="headerlink" title="VR is ready to disrupt education"></a><strong>VR is ready to disrupt education</strong></h2><p> The VR industry has historically been dedicated to gaming experiences, however, <strong>with Oculus Quest, educational apps are ready to steal the spotlight</strong>  and become part of global learning and development initiatives in organizations worldwide. <a class="link"   href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/emerging-tech/virtual-reality-study.html" >PwC recently conducted a study <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  showcasing the spectacular benefits of workplace training in VR. The research followed the outcomes of a soft skills training in a US-based organization, involving three learning modalities: classroom, e-learning, and VR. The outcomes were staggering, VR learners being up to <strong>4 times faster to train</strong> than in the classroom setting, and <strong>275% more confident</strong>  to apply the learned skills at their workplace. In addition to this, the VR learners were <strong>3.75 times more emotionally connected</strong> to the content and <strong>4 times more focused</strong> than their peers.</p><p> To better understand how the human brain responds to VR,  the University of Maryland’s College of Computer, Mathematical and Natural Sciences conducted a study  revealing that VR is more effective in acquiring skills due to its ability to enhance the neural connections needed for learning. As a result of the lifelike environments that learners experience, language immersion and simulations are easily accessible to everyone, changing the whole dynamic of education and enabling students to gain practical experience in numerous fields without the burden of logistics.</p><p> The first VR experience Mondly launched in 2017 has 100,000 users to date and is the most referenced VR language learning app in the academic space. 100+ research articles highlight its impact in advancing language learning.   <strong>VR creates a perfect environment for acquiring new skills at a 4 times faster rate compared to traditional learning methods.</strong></p><p> “Our continuous involvement in VR development and science-backed learning methodologies enables us to pioneer solutions for personal development, workforce training, and K-12 education, changing the way language learning is perceived across the world.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Veritable-Verses-of-Vintage-Verite"><a href="#Veritable-Verses-of-Vintage-Verite" class="headerlink" title="Veritable Verses of Vintage Vérité"></a>Veritable Verses of Vintage Vérité</h2><p> Love inspires us to do bold and sometimes crazy things. Things that don’t necessarily identify with our beliefs or everyday actions. Some people move across the globe to be with their loved ones, and others travel long distances on a regular basis. But maybe the most common (yet sweet) behavior is <a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875"><strong>learning a new language</strong> in the name of love</a> . Or maybe just a few right words. Because_amour_ and_je t’aime_ sound much more romantic than_love_ and _ <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >I love you <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _  . Yes, French has its reputation for being the language of love and <a class="link"   href="https://www.thelocal.fr/20141107/french-translates-love-google-language" >Google Translate has already confirmed this <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> several times.</p><p> But why do we all consider<strong>French</strong> the universal<strong>language of love</strong> ? Is it a positive stereotype that we have all come to believe? History says “definitely no”. As we can <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History%5Fof%5FFrance" >read for ourselves <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> today, Paris and the French, in general, had a unique way of embracing art in all its forms. Art, new tendencies, and love, apparently. Being less religious than other Europeans made French people more open about matters that regard love and social emancipation. That and the famous <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubadour" >troubadours <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> played a huge part in this matter. This is why the French are, even in the present days, regarded as renowned lovers. Besides, we cannot argue that French sounds particularly melodious and intimate.</p><p> Because lovers all over the world just celebrated Valentine’s Day, I thought that it would be a great time to share with you a list of <strong>7 French movies that will inspire you to learn the language of love</strong> . And I am not talking just about romantic love. Love should be celebrated in all its forms today – every day – even if it’s not Valentine’s Day. So here are 7 movies that will probably throw you on an emotional rollercoaster.</p><h2 id="1-Un-Long-Dimanche-De-Fiancailles-2004"><a href="#1-Un-Long-Dimanche-De-Fiancailles-2004" class="headerlink" title="1. Un Long Dimanche De Fiançailles (2004)"></a>1. Un Long Dimanche De Fiançailles (2004)</h2><p> Following the story of Mathilde’s relentless search for her fiancé, who has disappeared from the trenches of the Somme during World War I, “Un long dimanche de fiançailles” is a great story of war, survival and, above all,<strong>love</strong> .</p><p> Determined to find out if her childhood sweetheart and fiancé actually died in the war, frail Mathilde slowly starts to resemble a genuine detective. Her journey creates a story about initiation in life and_amour_ that can (or cannot) overcome all odds.</p><p> The combination of period romance, detective story and black comedy is beautifully carved out. Watch it this weekend and let me know what you think about it in the comment section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/french-language-love-1024x576.png"                      alt="french-language-love" title="7 French Movies That Will Inspire You To Learn The Language Of Love 2"                ></p><p> Screen capture from “Un long dimanche de fiançailles”</p><h2 id="2-Le-Fabuleux-Destin-d’Amelie-Poulain-2002"><a href="#2-Le-Fabuleux-Destin-d’Amelie-Poulain-2002" class="headerlink" title="2. Le Fabuleux Destin d’Amélie Poulain (2002)"></a>2. Le Fabuleux Destin d’Amélie Poulain (2002)</h2><p> This is a must-see not only for lovers but for everyone who is a fan of visual poetry. Because that’s exactly what Amélie is: visual poetry.</p><p> The film follows the destiny of an innocent and maybe even naive young woman who decides to help those around her and discovers love in the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/learn-french-movies-1024x576.png"                      alt="learn-french-movies" title="7 French Movies That Will Inspire You To Learn The Language Of Love 3"                ></p><p> Screen capture from “Le fabuleux destin d’Amélie Poulain”</p><p> Honestly, it is really hard not to fall under the spell of this charming and deliciously romantic movie. Especially if you had a similar and quirky first-love experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868586/19272" target="_top" id="1868586">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868586" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868586/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Intouchables-2011"><a href="#3-Intouchables-2011" class="headerlink" title="3. Intouchables (2011)"></a>3. Intouchables (2011)</h2><p> If you have a best friend, you definitely have to watch this one. It will touch a chord. Or even two. I’m not even kidding! “Intouchables” follows the story of an unlikely friendship between a quadriplegic grumpy aristocrat and his young and funny caregiver. I mean, can it get more emotional than that?</p><p> This may not sound flattering, but this movie is beautifully predictable (yes, you read that right). And also humorous and extremely touching. In other words, perfect for a chill Sunday afternoon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/language-of-love-1024x576.jpg"                      alt="language-of-love" title="7 French Movies That Will Inspire You To Learn The Language Of Love 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044586/7443" target="_top" id="2044586">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044586" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044586/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Screen capture from “Intouchables”</p><p> It’s a clash between classes, a story about the healing power of friendship and people. If you ask me, it sounds like the perfect recipe for a movie designed to be a crowd-pleaser.</p><h2 id="4-Paris-Je-t’Aime-2006"><a href="#4-Paris-Je-t’Aime-2006" class="headerlink" title="4. Paris, Je t’Aime (2006)"></a>4. Paris, Je t’Aime (2006)</h2><p> There’s no need to tell you more about “Paris, je t’aime”. Its title is self-explanatory and even relatable for some of us. Paris is definitely a lovable city. And it has a long history of being a lovable city.<a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege%5Fof%5FParis%5F%28845%29" >Viking raiders approve <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> this message.</p><p> On the other hand, if you are looking for a movie about a great love story, this is not one of them. Because it is actually about 18 love stories (Gotcha!). Every single one unique in its own way. 18 love stories about French people, tourists or immigrants falling in love. Relatable enough for me.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/learn-french-1024x576.jpg"                      alt="learn-french" title="7 French Movies That Will Inspire You To Learn The Language Of Love 5"                ></p><p> Screen capture from “Paris, je t’aime”</p><p> All in all, this is a bohemian’s delight: two hours of short films celebrating love in the most romantic city in the world.</p><h2 id="5-Jeux-d’Enfants-2003"><a href="#5-Jeux-d’Enfants-2003" class="headerlink" title="5. Jeux d’Enfants (2003)"></a>5. Jeux d’Enfants (2003)</h2><p> I don’t remember when I first fell in love with Marion Cotillard. Theatrically speaking, of course. But there’s a great chance it might have been when I saw this movie. She’s one of the most talented actresses today, and “Jeux d’enfants” was the movie that set her career in motion.</p><p> This movie is for those of us who have a contagious fascination with watching people for whom going too far is never far enough.</p><p> Imagine teasing and tormenting your crush today, as an adult, the same way you did when you were a child. “Jeux d’enfants” is about this on a much larger scale. It’s a game of daring and loving that never ends. Deliciously entertaining!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/french-movies-learn-language-love-1024x576.jpg"                      alt="french-movies-learn-language-love" title="7 French Movies That Will Inspire You To Learn The Language Of Love 6"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/1943750/22993" target="_top" id="1943750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1943750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://homestyler.sjv.io/i/5597632/1943750/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Screen capture from “Jeux d’enfants”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557742/17382" target="_top" id="1557742">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557742" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557742/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-L’Auberge-Espagnole-2002"><a href="#6-L’Auberge-Espagnole-2002" class="headerlink" title="6. L’Auberge Espagnole (2002)"></a>6. L’Auberge Espagnole (2002)</h2><p> I was reluctant when a friend of mine first recommended me to see this movie. I honestly thought this was just another lame comedy about the cultural clash between global students. But boy, was I wrong!</p><p>“L’auberge espagnole” follows the story of a French student who moves into an apartment in Barcelona together with six other students from all over Europe. They are young, restless and loving. What more can you want?</p><p> If you studied at least one semester in another country, you will relate to this movie and love it. If you didn’t study in another country, you will probably wish you did. Just see it and apply for that Erasmus scholarship already!</p><p> Charming and exhilarating, the end of this movie will leave you wanting more time with its inexperienced characters.</p><h2 id="7-Les-Choristes-2004"><a href="#7-Les-Choristes-2004" class="headerlink" title="7. Les Choristes (2004)"></a>7. Les Choristes (2004)</h2><p> Music and love are international languages and this heart-warming movie is about both. Following the story of a severely administered boys’ boarding school and how the new teacher uses the healing power of music to change things, “Les Choristes” is infused with nostalgia and love.</p><p> You may think “Les Choristes” is the European emotional version of “Dead Poets Society” and you wouldn’t be wrong. The only difference is that the interpretation of certain music pieces in “Les Choristes” will probably give you goosebumps.

You don’t have to visit Japan to know that. We all heard about the famously polite<strong>Japanese bow</strong> and about the big emphasis Japanese people place on the respect of hierarchy in the family and etiquette in general. It’s in their DNA. And the same as its culture, the<strong>Japanese language</strong> is one of the most polite languages in the world. It’s true that, as a tourist, you don’t have to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn Japanese <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to perfection, but you know what they say: when in Rome, do as the Romans do and you will certainly increase the enjoyment of your adventure.</p><p> Learning as much as a simple <strong><em>Konnichiwa</em> (“hello” in Japanese)</strong> or <strong><em>Arigato</em> (“thank you” in Japanese)</strong> can work wonders. So here’s a guide to all the<strong>Japanese greetings</strong> you’ll need in your Japanese adventure: from<strong>“hello” in Japanese</strong> to**<em>Moshi Moshi</em>** (used to say “hello” on the phone), goodbye and other<strong>common Japanese greetings.</strong></p><h2 id="1-“Hello”-in-Japanese"><a href="#1-“Hello”-in-Japanese" class="headerlink" title="1. “Hello” in Japanese"></a>1. “Hello” in Japanese</h2><p> If you ever watched at least one anime series, you probably already know this: <strong>“hello” in Japanese is_Konnichiwa_ .</strong> Rings any bell? It most probably does since**<em>Konnichiwa</em>** is undeniably the most<strong>common Japanese greeting.</strong> Thanks to some of the most influential anime of all time such as Dragon Ball Z, Death Note, and Naruto, a lot of people living outside Japan know at least a few <a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875"><strong>words in Japanese</strong></a> and_Konnichiwa_ is definitely one of them.</p><p> But back in the day, when Japanese people met, they would address each other with_konnichi wa gokiken ikaga desu ka?_ (“wow are you feeling today?”),<em>konnichi wa ii hi desu ne</em> (“today is a nice day”) or_kon’nichi wa ikaga desu ka_ (“how is today?”). Over time, these expressions became shorter and shorter until they ultimately transformed to the**<em>Konnichiwa</em>** we all use today to greet each other in Japanese.</p><p> Also, keep in mind that it’s usually only used during the daytime, between morning and evening.</p><p> When it comes to using it in various social contexts, you should know that**<em>Konnichiwa</em>** can be used safely in all kinds of situations (only between morning and evening; never early in the morning or late at night) except for those involving very close friends. It could be a little awkward to use**<em>Konnichiwa</em>** (こんにちは) when meeting your Japanese friends. In this situation, it’s better to use something a lot more informal than that, like:</p><ul><li><em>ossu</em> – used exclusively between male friends and relatives around the same age. It’s similar to “hey dude” or “hey man” in English</li><li><em>yaho</em> – extremely informal, typically used by girls (boys more often say_yo_) but suitable for all the young people</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/honnichiwa-1024x683.jpg"                      alt="honnichiwa" title="Hello In Japanese - All The Japanese Greetings You Need To Know 2"                ></p><p> “Kyoto, Japan” by Sorasak©</p><p> If you have to write<strong>“hello” in Japanese,</strong> there are two ways to do it (three if you also count in Romaji – the romanization of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Japanese writing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> system):</p><p> -using<strong>Kanji symbols:</strong> 今日は</p><p> – using<strong>Hiragana symbols:</strong> こんにちは</p><p> Curious about why there are multiple types of characters in Japanese?

Good morning in Japanese and other relevant greetings"></a>2. Good morning in Japanese and other relevant greetings</h2><p><strong>Good morning in Japanese</strong>   <strong>– O_hayō gozaimasu_</strong>  (おはよう ございます) is the best choice for greeting someone in the early morning hours (before 10:00 a.m.). Unlike_Konnichiwa_ ,   <strong>O_hayō gozaimasu_</strong>  a little more formal, so it’s safe to use it with people you don’t know or when you are meeting people in a position of authority (such as your boss or your teacher).</p><p>This greeting is used both as a “hello” and as a “goodbye”.</p><p><strong>Good evening in Japanese</strong>   <strong>– K_onbanwa_</strong>  (こんばんは) – is how you should greet people in the late afternoon or evening hours. The same as_Ohayō gozaimasu_ , <strong>K_onbanwa_</strong>  can be used both as a “hello” and as a “goodbye”.</p><p> If you are leaving, you can also say_Oyasumi nasai_ (おやすみなさい) to say “goodbye” in Japanese at night. But only when you leave as this Japanese phrase is not typically used as a greeting.</p><p><strong>Good night in Japanese</strong>   <strong>–<em>Oyasuminasai</em></strong>  (おやすみなさい) – is how you greet someone in Japanese if you are leaving at night. This Japanese phrase is not typically used as a greeting, so don’t forget you can’t use it when you meet someone.</p><p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Morning and evening are more carefully delimited in the Japanese culture than in the West. So it’s important to know your**<em>Konnichiwa</em>** and never use it instead of**<em>Konbanwa</em>** or**<em>Oyasuminasai.</em>**</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hi-in-japanese-960x639.jpg"                      alt="hi in Japanese" title="Hello In Japanese - All The Japanese Greetings You Need To Know 3"                ></p><p> “Meguro River, Matsuno, Japan” by Sora Sagano©</p><h2 id="3-“Goodbye”-in-Japanese"><a href="#3-“Goodbye”-in-Japanese" class="headerlink" title="3.“Goodbye” in Japanese"></a>3.“Goodbye” in Japanese</h2><p> Another greeting we borrowed from the Japanese and sometimes use in our day-to-day conversations in English is**<em>Sayōnara</em>** (さよなら), a greeting that carries the connotation of farewell and translates to “goodbye”.</p><p><strong><em>Sayōnara</em></strong> derived from_Sayō naraba_ (“If that’s the way it is”), a phrase that was originally used by people before leaving in a way that would sum up a conversation. Nowadays,<em>Sayōnara</em>  is a semi-formal way to say<strong>“goodbye” in Japanese.</strong></p><p> Although notorious abroad, Japanese people don’t really use_<strong>Sayonara.</strong>_ For informal situations that involve close friends, they prefer using**<em>bai bai</em>** (ばいばい), which translates to – you guessed it – “bye bye” in English,<em>jaa ne</em> (じゃあね) which translates to “see you” or_saraba da_ (さらばだ) which is the equivalent of “adios!”.</p><p> Want more? Here are other ways to say goodbye in Japanese that are suitable for both formal and informal situations:</p><ul><li>I’ll see you later. – <em>Mata aimashou.</em>  (また会いましょう。)</li><li>Take care! – <em>Ki wo tsukete!</em>  (きをつけて！)</li><li>See you tomorrow! – M_ata ashita!_  (またあした！)</li><li>See you soon! – <em>Mata ne!</em>  (またね！)</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/goodbye-in-japanese-1024x683.jpg"                      alt="goodbye in Japanese" title="Hello In Japanese - All The Japanese Greetings You Need To Know 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014848/22899" target="_top" id="2014848">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014848" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014848/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> “See you soon, human” by Alain Pham©</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134224/18498" target="_top" id="2134224">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134224" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134224/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-“Thank-you”-in-Japanese-and-other-polite-phrases-that-you-should-know"><a href="#4-“Thank-you”-in-Japanese-and-other-polite-phrases-that-you-should-know" class="headerlink" title="4. “Thank you” in Japanese and other polite phrases that you should know"></a>4. “Thank you” in Japanese and other polite phrases that you should know</h2><p> We already settled that the Japanese culture is a culture of respect and politeness. Thus, learning to say<strong>“thank you” in Japanese</strong> is probably one of your most important tasks to complete before visiting Japan. Lucky for you, there’s nothing difficult about that.</p><p> The most casual and common way to say<strong>“thank you” in Japanese</strong> to your family and friends is**<em>Arigatou</em>** (ありがとう). Not “Arigato”. That’s actually a very common misconception about how to write “thank you” in Romaji.</p><p> Japanese people use**<em>Arigatou</em>** the same way we use<strong>“thanks”</strong> , but they also have an even shorter way to express their gratitude within a group of friends:<em>Domo</em> (どうも).<em>Domo</em> translates to “very much”.</p><p> Moving to a slightly formal form,<strong><em>Domo arigatou</em></strong> (どうもありがとう) is the equivalent of<strong>“thank you”.</strong> Careful though! This is not formal enough to be used with someone who is in a position of authority over you.</p><p> If you need a more formal way of<strong>thanking someone in Japanese,</strong> you should use one of these expressions:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Arigatou gozaimasu</em></strong> (ありがとうございます) – thank you very much</li><li><strong><em>Domo arigatou gozaimasu</em></strong> (どうもございまずいます) – an even more polite form for “thank you very much”</li><li><strong><em>Arigatou gozaimashita</em></strong> – suitable for when you want to thank someone for something that he or she did in the recent past</li><li><strong><em>Gochisou sama deshita</em></strong> – use this phrase if you want to thank for your meal. Furthermore, if you want to say that the meal is delicious, you say_Sore wa oishī desu_ (それはおいしいです) – “that’s delicious”.</li></ul><p> If you want to continue the conversation and reply to someone thanking you, you can use these <strong><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Japanese phrases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> :</strong></p><ul><li><em>Dou itashi mashite</em> (どういたしまして) – translates to “you’re welcome”</li><li><em>Iie</em> (いいえ) – instead of_Dou itashi mashite,_ you can say_Iie,_ which means “no” as in “it was nothing”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/arigato-1024x706.jpg"                      alt="arigato" title="Hello In Japanese - All The Japanese Greetings You Need To Know 5"                ></p><p> “Kyoto, Japan” by Andre Benz©</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134221/18498" target="_top" id="2134221">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134221" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134221/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Don’t-forget-about-the-Japanese-bow"><a href="#Don’t-forget-about-the-Japanese-bow" class="headerlink" title="Don’t forget about the Japanese bow"></a>Don’t forget about the Japanese bow</h2><p> Every<strong>“hello” in Japanese</strong> is usually accompanied by a bow, the Western world equivalent of a handshake. Our advice would be to not skip the bow if you really want to feel like you belong.</p><p><strong>The Japanese bow</strong> is an essential part of the culture of respect and <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette%5Fin%5FJapan" >etiquette <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in Japan. When you meet someone, you say**<em>Konnichiwa</em>** and you bow as a sign of respect. If you receive a bow, you immediately bow back. A simple but powerful gesture that perfectly embodies the beauty of the Japanese culture.</p><p> So here are the main things you should know about the<strong>Japanese bow:</strong></p><p> – bowing lower is a sign of respect.

I love my job and I always research the best tools and strategies available to catch my students’ attention – even though that may sometimes mean to resort to technology. And I say “resort to” because I know some of us condemn the use of modern tech like apps in the classroom (I’ll get back to that later). But as I found out in my 4 years as a teacher, not all technology is bad. After doing some extensive research I discovered some of<strong>the best apps for teachers</strong> and I want to share them all with you.</p><p> Back to what I said about “resorting to” apps or other types of tech in the classroom – yes, technology might not always be our best friend. Black Mirror, Netflix’s star show, emphasizes superbly that aspect, but whether we like it or not, technology is incredibly smart! It can help teachers everywhere teach better, smarter and faster. It doesn’t have to replace us, but it can support our work with<strong>clever educational apps for teachers</strong> that are willing to adapt and improve their teaching style – teachers like you or me.</p><p> Since we are here, I figured it would be best to classify my recommendations into two major categories –<strong>best apps for teaching</strong> and<strong>best apps for learning</strong> – and then take it from there.</p><h2 id="Best-apps-for-teaching"><a href="#Best-apps-for-teaching" class="headerlink" title="Best apps for teaching"></a>Best apps for teaching</h2><p> If you want to upgrade your teaching style in order to get closer to your elementary or secondary school students and win their interest and attention, I absolutely recommend researching some<strong>school apps for teachers.</strong> It won’t only help you; it will also make you look cooler in your students’ eyes. You know how teenagers’ minds work.</p><p> But don’t overdo it. If surrender yourself with software for teachers and countless tech solutions, it might be too much in the end. I used to work a full-time job at a multinational company before becoming a teacher and the managers insisted on working with one-page reports, project management apps, smaller Excel reports and daily reports on Slack. Honestly, I got lost. It was too much. That is why you have to focus on the basics. You don’t want “fancy”. You want “useful”. So here they are:<strong>the best educational apps for teachers.</strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135352/19272" target="_top" id="2135352">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135352" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135352/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-mondlyWORKS"><a href="#1-mondlyWORKS" class="headerlink" title="**1. mondlyWORKS"></a>**1. mondlyWORKS</h2><p> I will recommend <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the “best apps for learning” category too, but its integrative B2B platform also makes it one of<strong>the best educational apps for teachers</strong> –<strong>foreign language teachers</strong> especially.</p><p> Its principle is simple: the same way we share apps to watch movies we can now share Mondly to learn languages.

Slack"></a>**2. Slack</h2><p> You definitely need to communicate with both the students and their parents and Facebook is not the right place for it. Lately, I noticed that more and more teachers use Facebook groups for communication, but Slack is much more appropriate given the fact that Facebook is a place where personal stories and photos get shared.</p><p> Besides, if you are not a high school teacher, you’ll probably need a different communication channel since teens are allowed on Facebook only after the age of 13.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/teacher-parent-communication-app-1024x690.png"                      alt="teacher parent communication app" title="The 5 Best Apps For Language Teachers 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657396/16446" target="_top" id="1657396">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657396" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657396/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Screenshot of Slack</p><p> With Slack, you can create different “workspaces” for every group of students and their parents, communicate with the whole group at once or individually, give feedback, share reminders and homework to make sure everyone is up to date or use integrations such as Google+ Hangouts, Google Docs, and Google Calendar to share documents or set video call meetings with the parents. Very complex and helpful, but at the same easy to use – I can assure you.</p><h2 id="3-TrackCC"><a href="#3-TrackCC" class="headerlink" title="3. TrackCC"></a>3. <strong>TrackCC</strong></h2><p> I did a lot of research for this one, I must admit. The first two are not necessarily dedicated apps for teachers, but rather general apps that teachers successfully use in their activity. And that was completely intentional. I believe that we sometimes like to overcomplicate things, but why use a dedicated app for parent-teacher communication when you can use Slack – an easy app that most parents already have access to?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/attendance-app-for-teachers.png"                      alt="attendance app for teachers" title="The 5 Best Apps For Language Teachers 4"                ></p><p> TrackCC in a nutshell</p><p> Back to TrackCC – this is still not the perfect<strong>grading and attendance app</strong> I was looking for because of its somehow dull design, but the fact that it works is more important right now. While doing the initial research I found some grading apps for teachers that did not include the “attendance” feature and vice-versa. So TrackCC is really good because it includes both, it is intuitive and allows you, as a teacher, to keep track of grades and attendance and share them all in real time with both student and parents.</p><h2 id="4-Youtube"><a href="#4-Youtube" class="headerlink" title="**4. Youtube"></a>**4. Youtube</h2><p> You probably didn’t expect this one, but <strong>Youtube can actually be of the best educational tools for teachers</strong> if you know how to make the most of it.</p><p> If you’ll do some research on your area of interest, you’ll soon discover a lot of great content to share with your students. Ask them to watch the videos at home – or during class if they are shorter – and then discuss the topic, ask questions, give feedback and keep them involved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/educational-apps-for-teachers-1024x524.png"                      alt="educational apps for teachers" title="The 5 Best Apps For Language Teachers 5"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087408/7443" target="_top" id="2087408">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087408" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087408/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Screenshot of Youtube</p><p> Just test this theory on the Youtube educational channel <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q" >“Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  and see how your students react to your new learning strategy.</p><h2 id="5-Google-Earth"><a href="#5-Google-Earth" class="headerlink" title="**5. Google Earth"></a>**5. Google Earth</h2><p> I don’t know about your school, but there are countless educational institutions around the world that still use the good, ol’ paper map. That’s not necessarily bad, but Google Earth is a free service that looks absolutely amazing. And this is not just about the students. If I’d be a Geography teacher I’d love to use Google Earth. Is one thing to identify Mount Everest on a paper map and another to see it in the Google Earth app. Just look at this:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/school-apps-for-teachers-960x529.png"                      alt="school apps for teachers" title="The 5 Best Apps For Language Teachers 6"                ></p><p> Screenshot of Google Earth</p><p> And that is not applicable only for Geography, but also for Biology or Physics.

Before delivering your pick up line in French, take a moment to assess the situation. Is it the right moment for an icebreaker? What do you know about this person? If you notice something relevant that catches your eye, don’t hesitate to tailor one of the previously mentioned pick-up lines to make it more personal.</p><p> For instance, if you spotted a Formula 1-themed keychain or caught a bit of their conversation about a favorite action movie, use that information to your advantage.</p><h2 id="Best-Pick-Up-Lines-for-Girls-in-France"><a href="#Best-Pick-Up-Lines-for-Girls-in-France" class="headerlink" title="Best Pick Up Lines for Girls in France"></a>Best Pick Up Lines for Girls in France</h2><ul><li><em>Tu dois être un chef-d’œuvre, parce que chaque fois que je te vois, je me sens au Louvre.</em>  (“You must be a masterpiece, because every time I see you, I feel like I’m in the Louvre.”)</li><li><em>Es-tu un artiste ?

Delivering your French pick-up line too zealously may backfire. Instead of breaking the ice, it might make you come across as overbearing. That’s the last thing we want! Ensure you smile and clearly convey that your French pick-up line is meant as a lighthearted joke and an icebreaker.</p><p> In conclusion, pick up lines in French offer a unique charm and effectiveness in flirting, especially when you’re drawn to someone who appreciates the language of love. The key to success lies in their playful delivery and the personal touch you bring. Remember, the true art of using these lines is to spark joy and intrigue, creating memorable moments that resonate with the spirit of French allure. With a balanced approach and a light-hearted attitude, you’re set to make an impression that’s as captivating as the French language itself.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/french-pick-up-lines/&t=Whispering+Sweet+Nothings+in+French:+Irresistible+Pick-Up+Lines"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="Learn-French-for-the-one-you-love"><a href="#Learn-French-for-the-one-you-love" class="headerlink" title="Learn French for the one you love"></a>Learn French for the one you love</h3><p> Did you use one of these pick up lines in French and successfully broke the ice?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Kinder-to-Grade-School-in-Spanish-A-Kid’s-Journey"><a href="#Kinder-to-Grade-School-in-Spanish-A-Kid’s-Journey" class="headerlink" title="Kinder to Grade School in Spanish: A Kid’s Journey"></a>Kinder to Grade School in Spanish: A Kid’s Journey</h2><p> In today’s globalized world,<strong>Spanish for kids</strong> stands out as an invaluable learning opportunity. Recognizing the value of bilingualism, it’s vital to tap into the receptiveness of your children’s young minds and introduce them to Spanish while it’s still very easy to learn. Encouraging them to start learning Spanish for kids now will equip them with a skill they can use and appreciate throughout their lives as they mature into global citizens.</p><p> The goal is to instill a lasting love for this Romance language and make learning Spanish a fascinating adventure! So, let’s discover what are the best resources to help kids learn Spanish fast. Whether you’re thinking Spanish songs, books, or cartoons – they’re all included in this comprehensive guide.</p><h2 id="Introduction-to-Spanish-for-Kids"><a href="#Introduction-to-Spanish-for-Kids" class="headerlink" title="Introduction to Spanish for Kids"></a>Introduction to Spanish for Kids</h2><p> Teaching the little ones anything – from dinosaur names to Spanish for kids – is extremely simple if you know what methods to use. There are no ‘lazy’ children that ‘won’t study’. Only busy adults. If you give them your time and knowledge, kids’ minds will almost literally absorb all kinds of information, from languages to poetry or basic math, in no time.</p><p> How? Well, their brains have a less developed prefrontal cortex. Thus, they tend to use their imagination much more than us. While adults experience functional fixedness and see everything exactly as it is, <strong>children create unexpected connections to help them learn faster.</strong> Obviously, the difficulty level is different. So adults shouldn’t blame their ‘old’ and ‘dusty’ minds for not retaining information but for their lack of imagination.</p><p> Meanwhile, children have no problem associating new words with seemingly unrelated notions they already know. For example, my 4-year-old nephew associates the word_aburrido_ (‘bored’) with_burro_ (‘donkey’) – a Spanish word he already knew. The connection is Eeyore, the iconic donkey from Winnie the Pooh. He says that “Eeyore always looks sad, tired, and bored”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/HbU5XBerba9ws/giphy.gif"                      alt="spanish for kids" title="Engaging Spanish Learning For Kids: Games, Songs, And Activities 6"                ></p><p> So what is the best way to teach your kids Spanish without resorting to endless and sometimes expensive Spanish classes? Read on to discover all the best resources.</p><h2 id="The-Benefits-of-Learning-Spanish-at-a-Young-Age"><a href="#The-Benefits-of-Learning-Spanish-at-a-Young-Age" class="headerlink" title="The Benefits of Learning Spanish at a Young Age"></a>The Benefits of Learning Spanish at a Young Age</h2><p> <strong>Learning Spanish for kids holds numerous cognitive and social benefits,</strong> especially when starting at a very young age.<a class="link"   href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-17952-001" >Studies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> have consistently shown the extraordinary benefits of bilingualism on children’s intellectual growth. Far from being a burden, as some might believe, learning Spanish at a young age is actually a cognitive boon!</p><p> Bilingual children, such as those who are learning Spanish, frequently outperform their monolingual peers in numerous academic areas, including math, social studies, and reading. Their memory skills are often enhanced, with an improved ability to switch between tasks and solve problems.</p><p> Besides, learning Spanish for kids not only boosts academic performance but also fosters a greater understanding and appreciation for different cultures.

Although miles away from important high technology and innovation centers such as Berlin, London or Silicon Valley, we find inspiration everywhere around us – in people, places, art or even history.

Honterus, also known as Honter or Johann Hynter (Latinized as Johann Honterus or Ioannes Honterus), is best known for implementing the Lutheran reform in Transylvania and establishing the Evangelical Church of Augustan Confession in Romania.</p><p> Honterus also set up the first printing press in Brașov in 1539 and <strong>funded “Schola Coronensis”, the first humanist gymnasium in Southeast Europe,</strong> today known as the Johannes Honterus School. This is especially meaningful for us at Mondly as we believe that education can change the world for the better.</p><p> In our journey to help those who need it most, we draw inspiration from Honterus and pledge to give students the tools to succeed and the opportunity to learn in ways they never could have imagined.

During his stay, he published two of his most important works: a Latin grammar and_Rudimenta Cosmographica_ , a cosmography manual. Then, he moved to Basel and practiced printing, publishing and wood engraving. This is where he came into contact with printers Heinrich Petri, Johann Bebel and Michael Isengrin. His connections with all four printing workshops in Basel at that time prove to be especially relevant when he returns to native Transylvania and decides to set up a printing press.</p><p> In the following years, Honterus printed a large number of books, some of which he authored himself. Then, in 1542, he printed a new version of his cosmography manual,<em>Rudimenta Cosmographica</em> , this time in verse. Honterus believed that verses will help students remember the information in his manual faster.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/honterus-map-600x467.jpeg"                      alt="honterus map" title="Great Personalities Who Inspire Us: Johannes Honterus 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144297/7443" target="_top" id="2144297">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144297" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144297/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The map of the world by Johannes Honterus</p><p> Additionally,<em>Rudimenta Cosmographica</em> contained 13 maps of all known parts of the world engraved by Honterus himself.

Many consider_Rudimenta Cosmographica_ to be the first European-wide manual and the first Minor Atlas in Central and South-Eastern Europe.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135369/19272" target="_top" id="2135369">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135369" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135369/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Draw-inspiration-from-the-best"><a href="#Draw-inspiration-from-the-best" class="headerlink" title="Draw inspiration from the best"></a>Draw inspiration from the best</h2><p> Everything Johannes Honterus did throughout his life is an inspiration for us at Mondly. He literally put Romania on the map before the unified nation was even born and our ambition is to continue his endeavor.</p><p> After the two world premieres with <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Mondly VR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Mondly AR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , we felt even more motivated to fortify Romania’s place on the technological map of the world and help people become polyglots. This is why we’re continuously improving Mondly to make language learning easier every day.</p><p> While Honterus wrote his cosmography manual in verse to facilitate information retention, we created a gamified language learning experience that will bring magic to your screen and new languages into your brain. We drew inspiration from the most successful people in the world – from Steve Jobs and Elon Musk to Johannes Honterus – and we’re proud of it.</p><p> Our aim is to make you love learning a new language.

A great dream. We wanted to create something that will positively impact the lives of millions of people around the world. Our passion for technology, design and education inspired us to start working on a language project that was so ambitious, it seemed almost impossible to complete in the beginning.</p><p> Two years ago we made that dream come true. We built a great language learning app and we made it our mission to offer everyone lessons in as many languages as possible.</p><h2 id="On-May-28-2014-Mondly"><a href="#On-May-28-2014-Mondly" class="headerlink" title="On May 28 2014, Mondly"></a>On May 28 2014, Mondly</h2><p> We started small, but kept thinking big at every step of the way. Our developers, designers, language experts and translators all worked together to build a language learning app that’s easy to use, fun to learn with, and effective in real life situations.</p><p> There were good times and there were difficult times. It was our motivation to build the best language app out there that kept us going. On top of this, the positive feedback that we got from all of you convinced us that we’re doing the right thing.</p><p> We’ve come a long way since the beginning and there’s a lifetime of learning ahead of us.</p><p> With this in mind, we give you an infographic about where Mondly stands today. From here on, sky’s the limit.</p><p>Thank you for being a part of our journey <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Firstly, you’ll start small and that’s great! Like Rome, Seoul wasn’t built in a day. Nor your Korean vocabulary will ever be. Secondly, learning the days of the week is very practical and quite essential. Meetings, nights out, doctor appointments, reservations – will all happen on a certain day of the week. Last but not least, this basic Korean lesson will help you get a sense of how it feels to <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-6234&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6234?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ko&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6234?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ko" >learn Korean <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

However, to make sure they are completely glued into your brain, we are going to look at how these words were formed. Studying the etymology of a word or its formation can help you make associations and remember it faster. This little trick applies to any language, not just Korean.</p><p> As you can see, all days in Korean end in<strong>요일 (’yoil’) which translates to ‘day’ in English.</strong> Now all that remains to be analyzed is a single Korean character at the beginning of each of the seven words. Here’s what each day in Korean means in English:</p><ul><li><strong>월 (wol)</strong> in 월요일 (wollyoil – Monday) means <strong>‘moon’</strong></li><li><strong>화 (hwa)</strong> in 화요일 (hwayoil – Tuesday) means <strong>‘fire’</strong></li><li><strong>수 (su)</strong> in 수요일 (suyoil – Wednesday) means <strong>‘water’</strong></li><li><strong>목 (mok)</strong> in 목요일 (mogyoil – Thursday) means <strong>‘wood’ or ‘tree’</strong></li><li><strong>금 (geum)</strong> in 금요일 (geumyoil – Friday) means <strong>‘gold’</strong></li><li><strong>토 (to)</strong> in 토요일 (toyoil – Saturday) means <strong>‘soil’ or ‘earth’</strong></li><li><strong>일 (il)</strong> in 일요일 (illyoil – Sunday) means <strong>‘day’ or ‘sun’</strong></li></ul><p> We can all agree that Koreans are right: Friday is indeed ‘gold’ and we all love it!</p><p> As a little bonus, here’s an image that may come in handy later. Save it or screenshot it and use it to practice what you’ve just learned.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/days-of-the-week-in-korean.png"                      alt="days of the week in korean" title="The Days Of The Week In Korean 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/c/5597632/2148129/17093" target="_top" id="2148129">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17093-2148129" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/i/5597632/2148129/17093"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Days of the week in Korean</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144271/7443" target="_top" id="2144271">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144271" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144271/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Sample-phrases-with-each-day-of-the-week-in-Korean"><a href="#Sample-phrases-with-each-day-of-the-week-in-Korean" class="headerlink" title="Sample phrases with each day of the week in Korean"></a>Sample phrases with each day of the week in Korean</h2><p> If it’s all clear so far, let’s dive into some examples using the days of the week in Korean.

And no, we’re not talking about the Mexican soap opera for people who only had 3 weeks of Spanish in the 4th grade_(wink wink)_ . In all seriousness, how do you reply to the question that has been on everybody’s lips at one point? How do you tell the time in Spanish? Well, it’s time_(wink wink)_ to find out.</p><p> I know what you think and it’s true. We’re lucky enough to live in an era of rapid technological advancements. Even if you don’t own a watch, you probably have a smartphone. Asking or telling the time in Spanish or any other language may seem obsolete. But what if your phone’s battery is dead? I for one had a pretty interesting experience when I had to survive one week without a phone. I kept asking random people the time to make sure I wasn’t late and they looked at me like I was some kind of an alien. So yeah, knowing how to tell the time in Spanish can make all the difference!</p><p> One more thing! If you’ve learned <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >how to count in Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it will be extremely easy for you.</p><p>But first things first.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/cAEm5rSuuBEGY/giphy.gif"                      alt="Spanish time" title="How To Tell Time In Spanish - A Complete Guide For Beginners 2"                ></p><h2 id="¿Que-hora-es-–-how-to-ask-for-the-time-in-Spanish"><a href="#¿Que-hora-es-–-how-to-ask-for-the-time-in-Spanish" class="headerlink" title="¿Que hora es? – how to ask for the time in Spanish"></a>¿Que hora es? – how to ask for the time in Spanish</h2><p> In order to tell the time in Spanish, you’ll first have to learn how to properly ask for the time in Spanish. You can never be too cautious. I’m just making sure you’re not missing that_fiesta española_ you spent weeks thinking about!</p><p> In addition to the now well-known_<strong>¿que hora es?</strong>_ which literally translates to “what hour is it?”, you can also ask_<strong>¿tiene hora?</strong>_ which is literally “do you have the hour?”. Easy enough!</p><h2 id="The-basics-of-Spanish-time"><a href="#The-basics-of-Spanish-time" class="headerlink" title="The basics of Spanish time"></a>The basics of Spanish time</h2><p> To_decir la hora_ (“tell the time”) in Spanish, there are a few simple rules you’ll have to know.</p><p> First of all, always use the verb**<em>ser</em>** . No, not_estar_ , but_ser_ . If you don’t know what <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Spanish verbs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are all about, you might want to check this little <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >guide for beginners <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . To put it simply, time is a permanent entity that requires the use of the verb_ser_ .</p><p> Secondly, remember that only when talking about one o’clock, you’ll need to use the <strong>third person singular form of_ser_ .</strong> For all the other eleven hours, you can safely go with the plural form. Here’s how to tell the time in Spanish if the time is on the hour:</p><ul><li><em><strong>Es</strong> la una.</em> – It’s one o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las dos.</em> – It’s two o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las tres.</em> – It’s three o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las cuatro.</em> – It’s four o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las cinco.</em> – It’s five o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las seis.</em> – It’s six o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las siete.</em> – It’s seven o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las ocho.</em> – It’s eight o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las nueve.</em> – It’s nine o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las diez.</em> – It’s ten o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las once.</em> – It’s eleven o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las doce.</em> – It’s twelve o’clock.</li></ul><p> As you can see, the feminine article (<em>la&#x2F;las</em>) is used before the number. Why is that? Well, because it refers to_la hora_ . But again, remember that the singular form**<em>la</em>** will only be used in the case of<strong>“one o’clock”</strong> because we’re talking about a single hour.</p><p><em><strong>Nota bene:</strong></em> If you prefer to use the 24-hour clock, you should say**<em>son las dieciséis</em>** <strong>(“it’s 16:00”)</strong> instead of <strong><em>son las cuatro</em> (“it’s 4 o’clock p.m.”).</strong> But that will require a little more studying on your part. Don’t worry though. Spanish numbers are just as easy as learning how to tell the time. You can master them with Mondly faster than you can say Jack Robinson.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Benefits-of-Learning-a-New-Language-in-Your-Senior-Years"><a href="#The-Benefits-of-Learning-a-New-Language-in-Your-Senior-Years" class="headerlink" title="The Benefits of Learning a New Language in Your Senior Years"></a>The Benefits of Learning a New Language in Your Senior Years</h2><p> Are you ever too old to learn a new language? Well, the good news is that experts say you are never too old. Studies show that anyone at any age <a class="link"   href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ronna-benjamin/learning-a-new-language%5Fb%5F5608187.html" >can learn a new language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . In fact, it is even easier to start speaking in a foreign language now with all the advanced technology available on the market. <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >A chatbot, for instance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , can teach you new words and grammar through fun and engaging games. It can also help you with your accent of the language that you want to learn. Read on to find out why you should pick up a new language in your golden years.</p><h2 id="Neuroplasticity-and-Seniors"><a href="#Neuroplasticity-and-Seniors" class="headerlink" title="Neuroplasticity and Seniors"></a>Neuroplasticity and Seniors</h2><p> The brain’s neuroplasticity has been blamed for giving seniors a hard time to learn new language skills. It is defined as the brain’s ability to form and restructure synaptic connections, mainly in response to learning or injury. While neuroplasticity decreases as we age, a proverb that says, “you can’t teach an old dog new tricks” may also stop seniors from learning a second language, much less a third one.</p><p> The science may be right but the proverb is wrong for the most part. <a class="link"   href="http://hci.ucsd.edu/234/234ExtraReading/BachYRitaKercel2003SensorySubstitution.pdf" >Research on neuroplasticity challenges <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the assumption that seniors cannot learn a new language. This particular research notes that you can never be too old to learn new tricks. However, the researchers are not denying the fact that learning new things is much harder as a person grows older. This should not discourage seniors from <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learning French or German or any other language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , though.</p><p> Albert Costa, a professor of neuroscience in Barcelona’s Universitat Pompeu Fabra, said in an interview with the Guardian that older individuals learning a new language have an advantage over their younger counterparts. This is mainly because older people are armed with larger vocabularies. As a result, they will learn more words that are included in the arsenal of a native speaker.</p><p> Although this is advantageous, Costa adds that it is much more difficult for seniors to master accents. The good news is, there are game-like tutorials that can teach males and females ages 6 to 90 or over to speak a new language of their choosing. These games include voiceovers that teach participants how to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >pronounce <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> certain words.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134234/18498" target="_top" id="2134234">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134234" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134234/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bilingualism-Improves-Cognition"><a href="#Bilingualism-Improves-Cognition" class="headerlink" title="Bilingualism Improves Cognition"></a><strong>Bilingualism Improves Cognition</strong></h2><p> Bilingualism is beneficial to brain health, according to researchers at Edinburgh University. After examining medical records of 648 patients with Alzheimer’s disease in Hyderabad, the researchers found that monolingual patients developed dementia earlier than those who spoke two languages. The lead researcher, Thomas Bak, notes that learning a new language later in life is beneficial because it helps exercise the brain.</p><p> Experts in senior health agree with Bak. The brain needs exercise and learning a new word every day or a new language can structurally and functionally alter the brain. It can make it more efficient and more flexible. Playing brain games that keep the mind young is also advisable. This includes crossword puzzles, card games, and Scrabble. Seniors can also improve their problem-solving skills by building something. If you have always wanted to build a birdhouse, for example, starting this project will help you exercise your brain. Experts also suggest that you carry cash for your daily purchases. Counting your change and remembering simple mathematical computations is a good brain exercise.

Both institutions found that switching from one language to the other activates areas of the brain responsible for executive functioning. This involves the same area that is responsible for completing tasks.</p><p> According to the studies, utilizing this part of the brain often can decrease cognitive decline and can delay the initial effects of dementia. It must be noted that a third language is not required unless you are already bilingual. For multilingual individuals, learning a new language when you reach the age of 50 is a good way to improve brain health.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137380/7443" target="_top" id="2137380">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137380" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137380/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="More-Than-Just-Medical-Benefits"><a href="#More-Than-Just-Medical-Benefits" class="headerlink" title="More Than Just Medical Benefits"></a><strong>More Than Just Medical Benefits</strong></h3><p> Bilingualism does not only help keep your brain active, but it can also increase your social interactions.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Understanding-Romance-Speaking-Cultures"><a href="#Understanding-Romance-Speaking-Cultures" class="headerlink" title="Understanding Romance-Speaking Cultures"></a>Understanding Romance-Speaking Cultures</h2><p> The Romance languages have grown to become one of the most prominent language families in the world. Despite being just a subgroup of the Indo-European language family, the Romance languages are still the most famous language family there is. Although having (almost) nothing to do with love, we all love them. In fact, they are some of the most popular foreign languages that English speakers want to learn. Still, one question remains: what are the Romance languages exactly?</p><h2 id="What-are-the-Romance-languages"><a href="#What-are-the-Romance-languages" class="headerlink" title="What are the Romance languages?"></a>What are the Romance languages?</h2><p> <strong>The Romance languages are a group of related languages that gradually evolved from Vulgar Latin in the first ten centuries CE. Bound together by the common ancestor, they form a subgroup of the Italic branch of the Indo-European language family.</strong> The <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >most widely spoken <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Romance languages are Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Romanian, and Catalan.</p><p> If you are having trouble understanding that, imagine that the modern Romance languages are all siblings. This is basically the definition of a language family: a group of languages related through their descent from a common parental language or ancestral language. In the case of this language family, Vulgar Latin is the mother and the other influences represent the father.</p><p> Spoken mainly in the Americas, Europe, and parts of Africa, Romance languages have roughly 1 billion native speakers worldwide. Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian and Romanian are also national languages and the top 5 most important Romance languages. These five languages combined account for over 90 percent of those who <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-6018&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6018&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6018" >speak a Romance language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Romance-languages-complete-list"><a href="#Romance-languages-complete-list" class="headerlink" title="Romance languages complete list"></a>Romance languages complete list</h2><p> According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/romance" >Ethnologue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , there are 43 Romance languages: Aragonese, Aromanian, Arpitan, Asturian, Cajun French, Campidanese Sardinian, Catalan, Charapa Spanish, Corsican, Emilian, Extremaduran, Fala, French, Friulian, Galician, Gallurese Sardinian, Guernésiais, Istriot, Istro Romanian, Italian, Judeo-Italian, Ladin, Ladino, Ligurian, Logudorese Sardinian, Lombard, Megleno Romanian, Minderico, Mirandese, Napoletano-Calabrese, Occitan, Picard, Piedmontese, Portuguese, Romagnol, Romanian, Romansh, Sassarese Sardinian, Shuadit, Sicilian, Spanish, Venetian and Walloon.</p><p> However, you should know that categorizing languages is fairly difficult because of their existence on a continuum. Therefore, the exact number of languages in this family may vary depending on the source you are looking at.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047361/19272" target="_top" id="2047361">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047361" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047361/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-are-they-called-Romance-languages"><a href="#Why-are-they-called-Romance-languages" class="headerlink" title="Why are they called Romance languages?"></a>Why are they called Romance languages?</h2><p> It’s true that their name has nothing to do with ‘romance’, but why are they called Romance languages?</p><p> Well, the answer goes back to the first centuries of the Common Era. They’re called ‘Romance languages’ because, as we mentioned before, <strong>they all evolved from Latin and Latin was the language of the Romans and the Roman Empire.</strong></p><p> To be more precise, the term ‘romance’ comes from the Vulgar Latin adverb_rōmānicē_ (’in Roman’) which, in turn, derived from the adjective <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/romanicus"><em>rōmānicus</em></a> (meaning ‘Roman’).</p><p> Now back to ‘romance’. While there is no proof to support the connection to what we call ‘romance’ nowadays, three of the most popular Romance languages are considered to be very ‘romantic’ languages. We are talking, of course, about Spanish, French and Italian which have a reputation as ‘languages of love’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/what-are-the-romance-languages-960x541.jpg"                      alt="what are the romance languages" title="What Are The Romance Languages? 5"                ></p><p> “Mont Saint-Michel, France” by Fab Lentz©</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134221/18498" target="_top" id="2134221">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134221" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134221/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Latin-based-languages-–-where-do-they-come-from"><a href="#Latin-based-languages-–-where-do-they-come-from" class="headerlink" title="Latin-based languages – where do they come from?"></a>Latin-based languages – where do they come from?</h2><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Romance-languages" >origin story <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of the Romance languages was (and in some cases still is) highly disputed between historians and linguists. Less commonly known as Latin-based languages or simply Latin languages, they share Latin as the common ancestor. That you already know. But how did this happen?</p><p> As the Roman Empire spread throughout Europe, the local population in most of those areas adopted two forms of Latin. One of them was Classical Latin, which was the formal language used by the upper classes. The other one was Vulgar Latin.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137210/26400" target="_top" id="2137210">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137210" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137210/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-does-‘Vulgar-Latin’-mean"><a href="#What-does-‘Vulgar-Latin’-mean" class="headerlink" title="What does ‘Vulgar Latin’ mean?"></a>What does ‘Vulgar Latin’ mean?</h3><p> Like ‘romance’, the word ‘vulgar’ in ‘Vulgar Latin’ doesn’t mean what you think it means. People didn’t use a special kind of Latin to be rude to one another.</p><p> ‘Vulgar’ comes from the Latin word <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vulgus"><em>vulgus</em></a> which translates to ‘common people’. Thus, <strong><a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgar%5FLatin" >Vulgar Latin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> refers to the common or vernacular dialects of Latin spoken by common people across the Roman Empire.</strong> To bring this example to present times, think about British English. Not everyone in The UK speaks the Queen’s English, do they?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/italian-960x768.jpg"                      alt="italian" title="What Are The Romance Languages? 6"                ></p><p> “Manarola, Italy” by Robert Aniței©</p><p> Back to our origin story, as you might have guessed, Vulgar Latin is the Latin that spread amongst the local populations of the Roman Empire. Then, over time, it evolved separately into different varieties of spoken Latin all over the empire.</p><p> After the fall of the Roman Empire, these Latin varieties started to diverge even more and eventually evolved into separate languages. Unlike today, back in those days, there was no TV, radio or universal education to keep people up-to-date with the standard form of Latin. Consequently, the spoken forms of Latin diverged quite easily into the Romance languages we all know and love today.</p><h2 id="How-similar-are-Romance-languages"><a href="#How-similar-are-Romance-languages" class="headerlink" title="How similar are Romance languages?"></a>How similar are Romance languages?</h2><p> <strong>Let’s put it this way: if you learn one Romance language, you’ll certainly ease your way into the next.</strong> The most mutually intelligible are <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Spanish and Portuguese <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which people mistake one for another more often than you’d think. Then, there’s also a degree of intelligibility between Spanish and Italian and Italian and Romanian.</p><p> However, that intelligibility mostly goes in one direction. For example, Portuguese speakers can often understand Spanish very well, but Spanish speakers can’t understand Portuguese because of its complex phonology.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/latin-based-languages.png"                      alt="latin based languages" title="What Are The Romance Languages? 7"                ></p><p> Romanian is always the odd one out.</p><p> Although all the modern Romance languages are definitely closer to each other than to Latin, if you really are passionate about languages, it might prove fun to learn Latin (which, by the way, you can do with <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-6018&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6018&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6018" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ).

This is not a matter of culture, but rather a matter of international common sense. It doesn’t matter if you are a French man in Romania or an American woman in Sweden. Common sense translates the same in all languages. How to say “thank you” in different languages should probably be included in students’ curricula at school. Expressing your gratitude is as important as expressing your love.</p><p> Besides, this has everything to do with first impressions. As Will Rogers (American stage and motion picture actor) once said: “You never get a second chance to make a first impression”. So you have to make it count from the first try. We are people. We tend to automatically judge. We only need 30 seconds to make a full semiotic analysis of someone we’ve just met. That’s it! 30 seconds for an impression that may last a lifetime. If you travel to a foreign country, making that good first impression may mean to say<strong>“thank you” in Spanish</strong> (“gracias”). That doesn’t sound that hard to do, isn’t it?</p><h2 id="How-to-say-“thank-you”-in-30-languages"><a href="#How-to-say-“thank-you”-in-30-languages" class="headerlink" title="How to say “thank you” in 30 languages"></a>How to say “thank you” in 30 languages</h2><ul><li><strong>Thank you in Afrikaans:</strong> <em>Dankie</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Arabic:</strong> <em>شكرا لك</em> (<em>“Shukran lak”</em> for males;<em>“Shukran laki”</em> for females)</li><li><strong>Thank you in Bulgarian:</strong> <em>Благодаря (Blagodarya)</em></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Thank you in Chinese <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> :</strong> _谢谢你 (Xièxiè nǐ) _</li><li><strong>Thank you in Croatian:</strong> <em>Hvala</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Czech:</strong> <em>Děkuji</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Danish:</strong> <em>Tak</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Dutch:</strong> <em>Dank u</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Finnish:</strong> <em>Kiitos</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in French:</strong> <em>Merci</em></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Thank you in German <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> :</strong> <em>Danke</em></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Thank you in Greek <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> :</strong> _Ευχαριστώ (Efcharistó) _</li><li><strong>Thank you in Hebrew:</strong> <em>תודה (Toda)</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Hindi:</strong> <em>धन्यवाद (Dhanyavaad)</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Hungarian:</strong> <em>Köszönöm</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Indonesian:</strong> <em>Terima kasih</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Italian:</strong> <em>Grazie</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Japanese:</strong> <em>ありがとうございます (Arigatō gozaimasu)</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Korean:</strong> <em>감사합니다 (Gamsahabnida)</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Norwegian:</strong> <em>Takk</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Persian:</strong> <em>سپاسگزارم (Sepaas gozaaram)</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Polish:</strong> <em>Dziękuję</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Portuguese:</strong> <em>Obrigado</em> (for males);<em>Obrigada</em> (for females)</li><li><strong>Thank you in Romanian:</strong> <em>Mulţumesc</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Russian:</strong> <em>Спасибо (Spasibo)</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Spanish:</strong> <em>Gracias</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Swedish:</strong> <em>Tack</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Thai:</strong> <em>ขอบคุณ (Kòp kun)</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Turkish:</strong> <em>Teşekkürler</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Ukrainian:</strong> <em>Дякую (Dyakuyu)</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Vietnamese:</strong> <em>Cảm ơn</em></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-to-say-thank-you.jpg"                      alt="how to say thank you" title="How To Say Thank You In 30 Different Languages 2"                ></p><p> “Thanks” by Hanny Naibaho©</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868495/19272" target="_top" id="1868495">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868495" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868495/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-origin-of-saying-“thank-you”"><a href="#The-origin-of-saying-“thank-you”" class="headerlink" title="The origin of saying “thank you”"></a>The origin of saying “thank you”</h2><p> The mere act of expressing gratitude sits at the core of human interaction, so it should be interesting to analyze it a bit more. As the <a class="link"   href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/thank%5Fyou" >Oxford Dictionaries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> explain, “thank you” is “a polite expression used when acknowledging a gift, service, or compliment, or accepting or refusing an offer”. “Thank you” is basically the general expression of gratitude or politeness to someone for an act of kindness that he or she has done.</p><p> But what is the origin of this expression? <a class="link"   href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/thank--you" >Online sources <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  claim that in Old English “thank you” had the form <em>þancian</em> “to give thanks” – a word that originated from Proto-Germanic_thankojan_ (similar to Old Saxon_thancon_ , Old Norse_þakka_ , Danish_takke_ , Old Frisian_thankia_ , German_danken_ – “to thank”). But all this was also derived from the original_thankoz_ which meant “thought, gratitude,” from the Proto-Indo-European root_tong_ – “to think, feel”. In short, that means that “thank you” is actually derived from the verb “to think”! So people used to express their gratitude differently in the past. If we were to paraphrase its meaning, we could say “because of what you have done for me, I think favorably of you”.</p><p> Naturally, there are many other languages in which this expression has transitioned through other forms before settling to its present one. Here are only a few examples:</p><p><strong>–</strong> <strong>Thank you in Portuguese</strong> <em>(obrigado&#x2F;obrigada)</em> – originates from the past participle of the Latin_obligō_ (“I bind in obligation”)</p><p><strong>–</strong> <strong>Thank you in French</strong> –<em>merci</em> – originates from the Latin_mercēs_ that means “wages, payment, reward”</p><p><strong>–</strong> <strong>Thank you in Spanish</strong> <em>(gracias)</em> and<strong>thank you in Italian</strong> <em>(grazie)</em> are quite similar so it’s no surprise they originate from the same Latin expression –<em>gratias agere</em> – which simply means “to express gratitude”</p><p><strong>–</strong> <strong>Thank you in Japanese</strong> (<em>arigatō gozaimasu</em> or simply_arigatō_ for “thanks) – originates from_arikatashi_ where “ari” is a verb meaning “to be” and “katashi” is an adjective meaning “difficult”. The original meaning of “arigatashi” was “difficult to be”. Put into a context, that would mean that someone’s generosity or behavior is “rare” and thus “special”.</p><p> Now that you know how to say “thank you” in 30 languages, take a step further and learn <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >how to say “I love you” in 30 languages. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/how-to-say-thank-you-in-30-different-languages/&t=How+to+Say+Thank+You+in+30+Different+Languages"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959778/19272" target="_top" id="1959778">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959778" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959778/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="From-0-to-conversational-in-over-40-languages"><a href="#From-0-to-conversational-in-over-40-languages" class="headerlink" title="From 0 to conversational in over 40 languages"></a>From 0 to conversational in over 40 languages</h2><p> Do you want to speak Spanish fluently fast?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Understanding-Belgian-Language-Etiquette"><a href="#Understanding-Belgian-Language-Etiquette" class="headerlink" title="Understanding Belgian Language Etiquette"></a>Understanding Belgian Language Etiquette</h2><p> Ok, let’s make it clear right from the start: there’s nfluento ‘Belgian’ language. Neither is there_a_ “Belgium language”. Why? Because<strong>Belgium has not one, but three official languages:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Dutch (Flemish);</strong></li><li><strong>French;</strong></li><li><strong>German.</strong></li></ol><p> Most people already know that Dutch and French are spoken in Belgium, but German is not as popular. While Dutch and French are spoken by almost 100% of Belgians,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >German only counts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for roughly 1% of the entire population. However, in addition to these three official languages, some Belgians also speak Luxembourgish, Limburgish, Walloon and many others. The language locals speak depends a lot on the region you’re in. Let’s take a closer look at the distribution of languages in Belgium.</p><h2 id="Which-languages-are-spoken-in-Belgium"><a href="#Which-languages-are-spoken-in-Belgium" class="headerlink" title="Which languages are spoken in Belgium?"></a>Which languages are spoken in Belgium?</h2><p> Belgium, officially “the Kingdom of Belgium”, is a country in Northwestern Europe bordered by <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >the Netherlands <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Germany, Luxembourg, France, and the North Sea. Now one thing we know for sure: Belgium certainly has many neighbors and most of them influenced which languages are spoken here.</p><p> Article 4 of the <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution%5Fof%5FBelgium" >Belgian constitution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> divides the country into three communities&#x2F;regions that are based on four language areas. These linguistic areas are: the French-speaking area, the Dutch-speaking area, the bilingual (French and Dutch) area of Brussels Capital, and the German-speaking area.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134227/18498" target="_top" id="2134227">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134227" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134227/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Dutch-Flemish"><a href="#1-Dutch-Flemish" class="headerlink" title="1. Dutch (Flemish)"></a>1. Dutch (Flemish)</h3><p> The Dutch-speaking region of Belgium, known as Flanders, is located in the northern part of the country. Flanders includes the cities of Antwerp, Bruges, and Ghent.</p><p> Though the standard form of Dutch used here is almost identical to that spoken in the Netherlands, it is often called “Belgian-Dutch” or, colloquially, “Flemish”.<strong>About 60% of the population of Belgium speaks Flemish.</strong> That’s roughly 6.5 million people.</p><p> If you already know how to speak Dutch, then you’ll have no problem communicating with people in Belgium. If not, don’t worry! There’s always French or even German.</p><h3 id="2-French"><a href="#2-French" class="headerlink" title="2. French"></a>2. French</h3><p> French is the primary language spoken in the southern region of Belgium, which is known as Wallonia. This area includes the cities of Brussels, Liege, and Namur.</p><p><strong>Spoken by about 40% of the population,</strong> Belgian-French is not very different from the “standard French” in France. Thus, if you want to mash two potatoes with one fork, learning French can come in handy in both neighboring countries.</p><p> Even if you don’t <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >speak French <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> fluently, being able to say a few phrases will go a long way in making locals feel more comfortable around you. Plus, it shows that you’re interested in their culture and willing to make a little effort to truly connect with them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027190/19272" target="_top" id="2027190">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027190" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027190/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-German"><a href="#3-German" class="headerlink" title="3.

This region is known as <strong>the German-speaking community of Belgium and includes about 73,000 people.</strong> That’s roughly 1% of the entire population of Belgium.</p><p> Considering this territory only joined Belgium after World War I, the German spoken here is not very different from “standard German”. Therefore, if you already <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >speak German <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you should have no problem communicating with the locals.</p><p><strong>Learn the languages of Belgium with Mondly</strong> 👇</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-7110&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-7110&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-7110" >Learn with Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="4-Luxembourgish-Limburgish-and-other-minority-languages"><a href="#4-Luxembourgish-Limburgish-and-other-minority-languages" class="headerlink" title="4.

Luxembourgish, Limburgish and other minority languages</h3><p> If you thought Flemish, French and German were the only languages spoken in Belgium, you’re in for a treat. In the Belgian province of Luxembourg, which – unsurprisingly – borders the country of Luxembourg, you can also hear<strong>a fourth language: Luxembourgish.</strong></p><p> Spoken in the Arelerland district, Luxembourgish is not recognized at a national level, but the French Community of Belgium acknowledges it as a minority language.</p><p> In addition to this, Belgium is also home to several other Germanic and Romance dialects or varieties:</p><ul><li><strong>Germanic dialects or varieties:</strong> Brabantian and East Flemish (both regarded as varieties of Dutch rather than separate Flemish languages), Limburgish, West Flemish, Low Dietsch;</li><li><strong>Romance dialects or varieties:</strong> Walloon, Picard, Champenois, and Lorrain (these are all varieties related to French that have been recognized by the French Community as separate languages).</li></ul><p> As you can see, the Kingdom of Belgium is a melting pot of different languages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/belgium-languages-960x600.jpg"                      alt="&quot;Belgium languages&quot; by Elijah G©" title="What Languages Do They Speak In Belgium? 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148634/16836" target="_top" id="2148634">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148634" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="80" height="31"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148634/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Can-you-get-by-with-English-in-Belgium"><a href="#Can-you-get-by-with-English-in-Belgium" class="headerlink" title="Can you get by with English in Belgium?"></a>Can you get by with English in Belgium?</h2><p> Yes and no. It all depends on which region you are visiting. <strong>People working in hospitality and other such “social” jobs will normally speak English – especially in the more touristy areas.</strong></p><p> However, it seems that, similar to Parisians, locals in Belgium are reluctant to talk to tourists in English. Especially if the visitors don’t attempt to talk in French, Dutch or German before resorting to English.</p><p> It’s true that all locals appreciate the extra effort you put into learning a few words in their native language. But Belgians tend to appreciate this gesture more than most. So, if you want to make friends, learning the basics of at least Dutch and French before your trip to Belgium can go a long way.</p><p> One last thing: be careful not to mix things up. If you’re in Wallonia, go with French, but if you’re in Flanders, go with Dutch. It is not uncommon for <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >French-speaking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Belgians to have a limited understanding of Flemish, so speaking Flemish in a French-speaking region may not help.</p><p> Besides, you may be met with silence if you do so. Both the Walloons and the Flemish are protective of their respective mother tongues and may not appreciate being spoken to in a language other than their own.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135373/19272" target="_top" id="2135373">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135373" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135373/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="A-brief-history-of-Belgium"><a href="#A-brief-history-of-Belgium" class="headerlink" title="A brief history of Belgium"></a>A brief history of Belgium</h2><p> The linguistic diversity of Belgium can be traced back to political and cultural conflicts that started centuries ago and continue to influence the country even today. The region that is now Belgium has been inhabited by various groups of people over the centuries, including the Celts, the Romans, the Franks, and the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Vikings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Besides, having important port cities like Antwerp, Bruges and Ghent made the region open to tradesmen, merchants, bankers and artists from all over the world. Naturally, these different groups brought their own languages and cultural traditions to the area.</p><p> To put it very briefly, in the Middle Ages, Belgium was a part of the Holy Roman Empire and was heavily influenced by its culture. However, after the fall of the empire, the region came under the control of the Burgundians, who spoke Old Dutch (the ancestor of the Dutch language). When the Burgundian Empire was divided, the southern part of Belgium became a part of the Habsburg Empire, which was dominated by the Spanish and the Austrians. Then, as a result of the French Revolutionary Wars campaigns in 1794, the Low Countries (which included today’s Belgium) were annexed by the French First Republic, bringing an end to Austrian rule in the region. As a result, the region came under the influence of the French language.</p><p> Over time, the linguistic divide between the northern and southern parts of Belgium became more pronounced – with the north-speaking Dutch (known as Flemish) and the south-speaking French. This divide was further exacerbated by political and cultural conflicts, such as the Belgian Revolution of 1830, which resulted in Belgium becoming an independent nation.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/languages-spoken-in-belgium/&t=What+Languages+Do+They+Speak+In+Belgium?"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="Start-learning-the-languages-of-Belgium-today"><a href="#Start-learning-the-languages-of-Belgium-today" class="headerlink" title="Start learning the languages of Belgium today"></a>Start learning the languages of Belgium today</h3><p> Do you want to learn Dutch, German, or French fast?

They are disarmingly honest and have an innocent way of being straightforward. If they don’t like you, they will tell you right away, so it’s not totally preposterous to think that they would make great judges in almost any kind of competition. This is why we were proud and honored when <strong>Google Play notified us that MondlyKids was selected as one of the Best Apps of 2017</strong> in a children’s category. And before we could properly celebrate the news,<strong>Google Play</strong> announced that<strong>MondlyKids</strong> is giving us yet another milestone to celebrate in 2017:<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Editors’ Choice language app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h3 id="Our-journey-of-learning-and-creating"><a href="#Our-journey-of-learning-and-creating" class="headerlink" title="Our journey of learning and creating"></a>Our journey of learning and creating</h3><p> We, at <a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-942&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-942&utm_source=blog-post-id-942&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-942&utm_source=blog-post-id-942&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-942&utm_source=blog-post-id-942&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-942&mt=8" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , started our journey of learning and creating almost five years ago. It required a lot of work, but it was worth every step of the way. Our aim was to create immersive learning experiences. We wanted to never stop innovating. So here we are today:</p><blockquote><p><em>We think your app was one of the best on Google Play in 2017. We know that you and your team have worked hard to create a unique and compelling experience, so consider this our way of saying thank you for bringing your innovation and expertise to the Play Store.</em>  – Google Play</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136627/26400" target="_top" id="2136627">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136627" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136627/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="MondlyKids-–-a-new-learning-experience-for-children"><a href="#MondlyKids-–-a-new-learning-experience-for-children" class="headerlink" title="MondlyKids – a new learning experience for children"></a>MondlyKids – a new learning experience for children</h2><p> After our first language app launch, it became quite clear the concept we were trying to tackle: learning through play. In an era labeled by visual stimuli and the constant lack of time, people are always looking for the fastest and most enjoyable ways to learn. This is why they chose and will continue to choose our innovative approach.</p><p> Afterwards, MondlyKids was only the natural course of action. And who likes best to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn through play if not children <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ? We entered their world, watched the cartoons they like, played all day and gained precious insights from every experience. Undoubtedly, the hardest part of the entire process was returning to adulthood.</p><p> The result? We created a child-friendly app with an eye-catching design and a cool story for 5 to 12 years old children that have a great thirst for knowledge and like gamified experiences. Cool sound effects and music are also here to keep the children engaged. Over the course of our 11 main lessons, children will become competitive and eager to learn, discover and interact more with their new virtual native speaker chipmunk friend.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080333/19272" target="_top" id="2080333">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080333" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080333/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-road-to-success"><a href="#The-road-to-success" class="headerlink" title="The road to success"></a>The road to success</h3><p> In order for the new Mondly app to match its exigent young target, we had to give children a new angle on progress and how important it is in the learning experience. This is the point where we decided to create our design around a map where the learning progress would be visualized in terms of traveling to new places – this is why a completed set of lessons will get you to a new place on the map; because knowledge broadens the mind and lets you travel.<a class="link"   href="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Mondly-for-Kids-free-languages-for-kids-small-1024x921.png"  title="Google Play Selects Mondly’s Kids App As One Of The Best Apps Of 2017 2">Mondly for Kids - free languages for kids (small) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.kids.languages&hl=en" >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.kids.languages&amp;hl=en <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> Today,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >months after launching MondlyKids <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , we discovered that the operating principle behind this map is perfectly valid in our journey as well.

But that doesn’t mean there aren’t any pick up lines in German. Of course, there are! Many people speak German. Some of them must have thought of a couple of German pick up lines, right? Well, yes. The German language does have quite a lot of conversation openers you can use during your next trip to Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol (Italy), Belgium, or Liechtenstein. Let’s see which they are. Happy flirting in German!</p><h2 id="Funny-Pick-Up-Lines-in-German"><a href="#Funny-Pick-Up-Lines-in-German" class="headerlink" title="Funny Pick Up Lines in German"></a>Funny Pick Up Lines in German</h2><ul><li><em>Glaubst du an Liebe auf den ersten Blick?

Do they like beer or football? We assume every German man does, but in reality, things are a little more complicated.

Just make sure to gauge the room, pick a suitable pick up line and act it with humor and wittiness.

Wishing someone to break their leg doesn’t sound especially friendly. But they are a valuable addition to your vocabulary. For instance, if you want to speak German like a fluent speaker, German idioms are probably the fastest way to get to it.</p><p> Once you start learning, the most exciting thing about<strong>German idioms</strong> is that <strong>they feel like learning a super secret code only the fluent speakers understand.</strong> As they provide useful insights into German culture and history, including idioms in your day-to-day conversations will make you sound like “one of their own.” So let’s cut to the chase and present you with the essential collection of German idioms designed to up your German game fast.</p><h2 id="Common-German-idioms-Germans-love"><a href="#Common-German-idioms-Germans-love" class="headerlink" title="Common German idioms Germans love"></a>Common German idioms Germans love</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/idiom" >Cambridge Dictionary <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> defines ‘idiom’ as “a group of words in a fixed order that has a particular meaning that is different from the meanings of each word on its own.” For example, to be “over the moon” is an idiom that means you are extremely happy or delighted. In other words, idioms have figurative, non-literal meanings because you’re not<strong>literally</strong> “over the moon.”</p><p> That being said, let’s see what such idioms Germans use the most in their daily interactions.</p><h3 id="1-Um-den-heisen-Brei-herumreden"><a href="#1-Um-den-heisen-Brei-herumreden" class="headerlink" title="1.Um den heißen Brei herumreden"></a>1.<em>Um den heißen Brei herumreden</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> To talk around the hot porridge.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> To beat around the bush.</p><p> Germans are usually pretty straightforward, but there are times when even they happen to beat around the bush. When such a situation occurs, you can use this idiom to invite them to get straight to the point.</p><h3 id="2-Eine-Extrawurst-haben"><a href="#2-Eine-Extrawurst-haben" class="headerlink" title="2. Eine Extrawurst haben"></a><strong>2.</strong> <em>Eine Extrawurst haben</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> To ask for an extra sausage.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> To ask for special treatment.</p><p> Germans and sausages go together like… well, Germans and sausages! For this reason, it’s no surprise that their idioms include_wursts_ . Even if the special treatment implies getting more dessert,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Germans will still say <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you’re asking for an extra sausage.</p><h3 id="3-Lugen-haben-kurze-Beine"><a href="#3-Lugen-haben-kurze-Beine" class="headerlink" title="3. Lügen haben kurze Beine"></a><strong>3.</strong> <em>Lügen haben kurze Beine</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> Lies have short legs.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> Lies won’t get you far.</p><p> Is someone lying to your face? Better remind them that_Lügen haben kurze Beine_ or lies won’t get them too far with those tiny legs. This idiom is similar to the English expression “Liar, liar, pants on fire.”</p><h3 id="4-Ich-glaube-ich-spinne"><a href="#4-Ich-glaube-ich-spinne" class="headerlink" title="4. Ich glaube ich spinne"></a><strong>4.</strong> <em>Ich glaube ich spinne</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> I believe I spider.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> I think I’m going crazy.</p><p> As odd as this one sounds, it will come in very handy in those situations when you can’t believe what you’re hearing or seeing. The English equivalent could be “You’ve got to be kidding me!”.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006955/19272" target="_top" id="2006955">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006955" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006955/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Seinen-Senf-dazugeben"><a href="#5-Seinen-Senf-dazugeben" class="headerlink" title="5.

Maybe you’re not up to date with the latest news, or you’re not seeing the truth staring you right in the face. Either way, tomatoes seem to affect your vision.</p><h3 id="8-Ich-verstehe-nur-Bahnhof"><a href="#8-Ich-verstehe-nur-Bahnhof" class="headerlink" title="8.

Its sentiment is similar to the English equivalent “Don’t count your chickens before they hatch. “</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123750/7443" target="_top" id="2123750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123750/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="10-Da-kannst-du-Gift-drauf-nehmen"><a href="#10-Da-kannst-du-Gift-drauf-nehmen" class="headerlink" title="10.

If you’re absolutely certain of the information you are giving, you can assure the person you are talking to by saying_Da kannst du Gift drauf nehmen_ , which essentially means “you can bet on it.”</p><h3 id="11-Du-gehst-mir-auf-den-Keks"><a href="#11-Du-gehst-mir-auf-den-Keks" class="headerlink" title="11.

It’s so cute that we’re actually thinking of making a petition to adopt it in English as well. Are you in?</p><h3 id="12-Da-steppt-der-Bar"><a href="#12-Da-steppt-der-Bar" class="headerlink" title="12. Da steppt der Bär"></a><strong>12.</strong> <em>Da steppt der Bär</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> The bear dances there.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> It’s a good party.</p><p> There are several ways to look at this one, but the main idea is that the party is so good that the bear will also join it. Or — there’s a dancing bear at the party and you should absolutely not miss it. Either way, this party is probably the best party ever.</p><h3 id="13-Das-ist-ein-Katzensprung"><a href="#13-Das-ist-ein-Katzensprung" class="headerlink" title="13.

Ein Fisch auf dem Trockenen"></a><strong>15.</strong> <em>Ein Fisch auf dem Trockenen</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> A fish on the dry.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> To feel like a fish out of the water.</p><p> It’s interesting how similar this idiom is to our English equivalent. It looks like feeling out of place is finally something more languages can agree on.</p><h3 id="16-Die-Daumen-drucken"><a href="#16-Die-Daumen-drucken" class="headerlink" title="16.

Instead of pulling one’s leg, they are taken on someone’s arm. Picture the scene and you can help but giggle! Obviously, both versions are used to express disbelief about someone’s actions or claims.</p><h3 id="18-Dumm-wie-Bohnenstroh"><a href="#18-Dumm-wie-Bohnenstroh" class="headerlink" title="18.
