Although they don’t make a lot of sense, tongue twisters are very helpful in speech therapy due to their repeated sounds. For this reason, they are used by actors, politicians and even news anchors before going live. Essentially, a tongue twister works like a physical exercise: the more you practice, the better your pronunciation will be.</p><p> According to the <a class="link"   href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/tongue-twister" >Cambridge Dictionary <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a tongue twister is <strong>“a sentence or phrase that is intended to be difficult to say, especially when repeated quickly and often”</strong> .

To make sure you are using your newly acquired French days of the week correctly, don’t forget that:</p><ul><li><p><strong>the days of the week are not capitalized in French</strong> – unless, of course, they appear at the beginning of a sentence;</p></li><li><p><strong>the French week starts on Monday;</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>days of the week are all masculine in French</strong> – this means you’ll always have to use masculine articles <em>(le</em> and <em>un)</em>  and masculine adjectives when talking about the days of the week. For example, if you want to say “the last Friday of the month was rainy” in French, you say <em>“le dernier vendredi du mois était pluvieux”;</em></p></li><li><p>in contrast to <em>le jour</em> , <a href="https://french.kwiziq.com/revision/grammar/when-to-use-an-annee-matin-matinee-jour-journee-soir-soiree-time-unit-vs-duration"><em>la journée</em></a> (which also translates to “day”) is a feminine noun that refers to a longer period of time during which something might happen. <em>Jour,</em> on the other hand, represents a precise moment, a unit of time. For example: “<em>Je te rendrai visite dans la journée”</em> (“I’ll visit you during the day”) is different from <em>“Je t’appelle dans deux jours”</em> (“I’ll call you in two days”).</p></li><li><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/days-of-the-week-in-french/&t=The+Days+of+the+Week+in+French"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></li><li><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></li></ul><hr><h4 id="From-0-to-conversational-in-French"><a href="#From-0-to-conversational-in-French" class="headerlink" title="From 0 to conversational in French"></a>From 0 to conversational in French</h4><p> Do you want to see the<strong>French weekdays</strong> in action?

A few decades ago, studies began to disprove these beliefs and instead show that the brain is a powerful organ capable of responding and adapting to new stimuli. This ability is known as neuroplasticity.</p><p> Despite what’s known about neuroplasticity, there are still many misconceptions about the abilities of the human brain. This is especially true when it comes to learning languages. You might have heard people say that language is best learned during childhood, and that adults beyond the age of fifty stand no chance of gaining fluency. If so, know that these statements are false. People have a tendency to pass ideas around without confirming their accuracy, and if you listen, you might miss out on the amazing experience of <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learning a foreign language later in life <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.zonealarm.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=36245101&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sc1.checkpoint.com/sc1/za/images/boxes/zang_box_trust.png"                      border="0"                >ZoneAlarm Extreme Security NextGen</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Learn-a-Language-in-Your-Fifties-It’s-Never-Too-Late-to-Get-Started"><a href="#Learn-a-Language-in-Your-Fifties-It’s-Never-Too-Late-to-Get-Started" class="headerlink" title="Learn a Language in Your Fifties: It’s Never Too Late to Get Started"></a><strong>Learn a Language in Your Fifties: It’s Never Too Late to Get Started</strong></h2><p> There’s some truth to what the naysayers are telling you. Neuroplasticity does decrease with age, and learning a language in your fifties might prove to be more challenging than learning it in elementary school. However, there is more to the story. While you might be slightly less sharp than you used to be, you also have strengths that young people do not.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1997795">                    <video width="250" height="250" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1997795">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:250px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fproteahair.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1997795%2F23621'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997795/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### **1\. An Expanded Vocabulary**<p> You might think that having a broad English vocabulary would hinder learning foreign languages, but that isn’t the case. A big part of language learning is understanding vocabulary, and when your brain is filled with a knowledge of the vocabulary of one language, it picks up on another language much easier. That said, older adults might have a harder time grasping the accent and pronunciation of the new language compared to young children.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-A-Platform-of-Success"><a href="#2-A-Platform-of-Success" class="headerlink" title="2.

You also know that the best things in life don’t come easy, and during the rough moments of language learning, you are more likely to commit to seeing the process through rather than giving up.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896607/21553" target="_top" id="1896607"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1896607"                      border="0" alt="" width="750" height="422"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1896607/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pexels-photo-346885.jpeg"                      alt="pexels photo 346885" title="4 Reasons Why You Should Learn A Language In Your Fifties (50S), Sixties (60S), Seventies (70S) &Amp; Beyond 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713565&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/audible-converter-interface.png"                      border="0"                >Epubor Audible Converter for Mac： Download and convert Audible AAXC&#x2F;AA&#x2F;AAX to MP3 with 100% original quality preserved.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-A-World-with-Fewer-Distractions"><a href="#3-A-World-with-Fewer-Distractions" class="headerlink" title="3.

Unlike some of your younger friends and family members, you don’t spend your time obsessing over what’s happening on social media or worrying about things you can’t control. You know yourself pretty well by now, and you’ve likely grown bored with many of the distractions that plague the minds of young people, instead choosing to focus more of your energy on the interests you’re passionate about. For that reason, this is an excellent phase of your life to begin learning a language.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40203538&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/cc4b82e826b52ec41c810301548e8f48/products/audio-to-text-transcription-software.png"                      border="0"                >EaseText Audio to Text Converter for Windows (Personal Edition) - An intelligent tool to transcribe &amp; convert audio to text freely </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-A-Reason-to-Travel"><a href="#4-A-Reason-to-Travel" class="headerlink" title="4.

It’s also true that by this phase of life, most are beyond raising children, and they, therefore, have more funds to devote toward travel and leisure.</p><p> If you’ve always wanted to see the world, you’ll have plenty of motivation to learn foreign languages. Even as much as a basic understanding of a language of your chosen country will make visiting there much more enjoyable. You’ll be able to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >converse with the locals when visiting Paris <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Barcelona <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  on a more intimate level and have an overall better experience.</p><p> If you’ve never considered travel during retirement, it’s possible that your efforts to learn foreign languages will inspire you. Through learning a language, you also pick up on other aspects of the associated culture, and the more you learn about other cultures, the more exciting the prospect of travel will seem.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/4-reasons-to-learn-languages-in-your-fifties-50s-60s-70s/&t=4+Reasons+Why+You+Should+Learn+a+Language+in+Your+Fifties+(50s),+Sixties+(60s),+Seventies+(70s)+&+beyond"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Learning-Foreign-Languages-Later-in-Life-Keeping-the-Brain-Young"><a href="#Learning-Foreign-Languages-Later-in-Life-Keeping-the-Brain-Young" class="headerlink" title="Learning Foreign Languages Later in Life: Keeping the Brain Young"></a><strong>Learning Foreign Languages Later in Life: Keeping the Brain Young</strong></h2><p> Even if language learning does prove to be more difficult at your age, the challenge might be a good thing. Much like exercise challenges the body, putting your brain to the test by learning a new language could help keep you mentally young and fit.</p><p> The threat of Alzheimer’s disease or dementia is frightening for most middle-aged adults. Nothing would be scarier than losing control of your own mind, but luckily, research is showing that the actions we take now might lessen our chances of developing one of these terrible conditions. One of the most effective things you can do is learn a foreign language. Research from Edinburgh University found that people who were bilingual developed dementia later than people who only spoke one language throughout their lives.</p><p> If you’re ready to expand your horizons, deepen your connection to the world around you, and help protect your brain against age-related degeneration, consider beginning your journey with foreign language learning today.</p><p><a

It’s unclear whether Latin made a comeback or it has been this cool for hundreds of years. But one thing is sure: <strong>Latin phrases are nowadays the cooler siblings of slang words.</strong> And Julius Caesar approves this message. So, let’s see the most famous Latin phrases you can use to impress your friends.</p><h2 id="Famous-Latin-Phrases-you-need-to-know"><a href="#Famous-Latin-Phrases-you-need-to-know" class="headerlink" title="Famous Latin Phrases you need to know"></a>Famous Latin Phrases you need to know</h2><p>These are nearly as famous as Julius Caesar himself.</p><h3 id="Veni-vidi-vici-—-I-came-I-saw-I-conquered"><a href="#Veni-vidi-vici-—-I-came-I-saw-I-conquered" class="headerlink" title="Veni, vidi, vici. — I came, I saw, I conquered."></a><strong>Veni, vidi, vici. —</strong> <em>I came, I saw, I conquered.</em></h3><p> Famously attributed to Julius Caesar in a message he supposedly sent to the Roman Senate to describe his swift, conclusive victory against King Pharnaces II of Pontus near Zela in 47 BC.</p><h3 id="Alea-iacta-est-—-The-die-has-been-cast"><a href="#Alea-iacta-est-—-The-die-has-been-cast" class="headerlink" title="Alea iacta est. — The die has been cast."></a><strong>Alea iacta est. —</strong> <em>The die has been cast.</em></h3><p> Another Latin phrase said by Julius Caesar upon crossing the Rubicon to enter Italy and begin the long civil war against Pompey and the Optimates. The meaning of this phrase refers to the point of no return.</p><h3 id="Carpe-diem-—-Seize-the-day"><a href="#Carpe-diem-—-Seize-the-day" class="headerlink" title="Carpe diem. — Seize the day."></a><strong>Carpe diem. —</strong> <em>Seize the day.</em></h3><p> Probably the most popular Latin phrase of modern times. Luckily, we have an even better one:<em>carpe vinum</em> . Literally ‘seize the wine’. The only Latin phrase you’ll ever need on a Friday night out. And speaking of night, you should also remember the_carpe noctem_ variation which literally translates to ‘seize the night’. Either way, the general meaning is to make the most of everything.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082538/7443" target="_top" id="2082538"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082538"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082538/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Cogito-ergo-sum-—-I-think-therefore-I-am"><a href="#Cogito-ergo-sum-—-I-think-therefore-I-am" class="headerlink" title="Cogito, ergo sum. — I think, therefore I am."></a><strong>Cogito, ergo sum. —</strong> <em>I think, therefore I am.</em></h3><p> A_dictum_ (‘a short statement that expresses a general truth’) coined by French philosopher René Descartes in Latin.</p><p> What Descartes doesn’t know is that nowadays people prefer the_bibo, ergo sum_ version which literally means “I drink, therefore I am”.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.absolute.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4601998&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ef70e26a0b5da778eda3f48014d087cd/728x90_larger-shield.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="In-vino-veritas-—In-wine-there-is-truth"><a href="#In-vino-veritas-—In-wine-there-is-truth" class="headerlink" title="In vino veritas. —In wine, there is truth."></a><strong>In vino veritas. —<em>In wine, there is truth.</em></strong></h3><p> Be careful if you_carpe vinum_ on that Friday night out we talked about.

Besides, this selection includes only the most relevant expressions so you don’t have to worry about redundancy.</p><p>Get ready to bring your Roman alter ego to life in 3… 2… 1. Go!</p><ul><li><strong>Castigat ridendo mores.</strong> — <em>Laughing corrects morals.</em></li></ul><p> According to this phrase, one supposedly corrects bad habits by laughing at them. Of course, you shouldn’t laugh at strangers, but your close friends will probably like the idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Cui bono?</strong> —<em>Good for whom?</em></li></ul><p> Or who benefits? Similar to the expression_sequere pecuniam_ (“follow the money”), this phrase suggests to look for the culprit in the person who would benefit from an unwelcome event.</p><ul><li><strong>Me vexat pede.</strong> — <em>It annoys me at the foot.</em></li></ul><p> Similar to the English saying “a pebble in one’s shoe”,<em>me vexat pede</em> refers to a trivial situation or person that is being a nuisance. The Romans don’t seem so serious anymore, do they?</p><ul><li><strong>Mulgere hircum.</strong> — <em>To milk a male goat.</em></li></ul><p> Am I wrong or is this your soon to be favorite Latin phrase? Although it hints at attempting the impossible – which is a very serious matter – you can not help but smile at the image.</p><ul><li><strong>Ex nihilo nihil fit.</strong> — <em>Nothing comes from nothing.</em></li></ul><p> Or so Lucretius said. Originally meaning “work is required to succeed”, the modern reinterpretation suggests that “everything has its origins in something”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/common-latin-phrases-960x720.jpg"                      alt="common latin phrases" title="50 Popular Latin Phrases To Impress Your Friends 8"                ></p><p> “Laughing” by Peter Lloyd©</p><ul><li><strong>Nemo saltat sobrius.</strong> —<em>Nobody dances sober.</em></li></ul><p> Have you heard about Cicero? The famous Roman statesman, lawyer, scholar, philosopher and Academic Skeptic? Well, he said this. Probably after an interesting night during which_carpe vinum_ was his favorite motto.</p><ul><li><strong>Nitimur in vetitum.</strong> — <em>We strive for the forbidden.</em></li></ul><p> From Ovid’s ‘Amores’. This behavior is no stranger to the modern world. Highly disputed between philophers,<em>nitimur in vetitum</em> was also what drove Eve to take a bite from the forbidden fruit.</p><ul><li><strong>Caesar non supra grammaticos.</strong> — <em>The Emperor is not above the grammarians.</em></li></ul><p> Know any grammar nazis? Because they’ll love this Latin phrase. Its origin goes back to 1414, when the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg made a grammar mistake during his speech to the Council of Constance. After the error was pointed out to him, Sigismund angrily decided to simply change the grammar rule to his liking. At his point, a member of the Council apparently stood and said “Caesar non supra grammaticos”. Pretty cool story, isn’t it?</p><ul><li><strong>Pecunia non olet.</strong> — <em>Money don’t smell.</em></li></ul><p> According to Suetonius, when to Roman emperor Vespasian imposed a urine tax, his son Titus complained of the money’s disgusting nature. Now you’re probably asking yourself what in heaven’s name is a urine tax. Well, the urine collected from Rome’s public urinals was sold as an ingredient for multiple chemical processes. So no, the people of Rome didn’t pay a tax to urinate. Instead, the buyers of the urine did.</p><p> You can probably imagine what happened next. Vespasian’s answer to his son was to hold up a gold coin and ask whether it smelled. The rest is… history.</p><ul><li><strong>Plenus venter non studet libenter.</strong> — <em>A full belly does not like studying.</em></li></ul><p> To be honest, my belly does not like studying when it’s empty either. What about yours?</p><p> Anyway, it seems that the Romans believed it is difficult to concentrate after a heavy meal.</p><p>Loading poll …</p><p>Coming Soon</p><p> What’s your favorite Latin phrase?</p><p> In vino veritas.

Genius if you ask me. Equivalent to “more haste, less speed”,<em>festina lente</em> essentially encourages you to proceed quickly, but cautiously.</p><ul><li><strong>Barba non facit philosophum.</strong> — <em>A beard doesn’t make one a philosopher.</em></li></ul><p> Want to sweep everyone off their feet with your erudite ways? Use this Latin phrase instead of its English equivalent: “clothes don’t make the man”. Or the similar_cucullus non facit monachum_ (“the hood does not make the monk”).</p><ul><li><strong>De gustibus non est disputandum.</strong> — <em>Of tastes there is nothing to be disputed.</em></li></ul><p>Different phrase, same story. You’re welcome.</p><ul><li><strong>Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes.</strong> — <em>I fear Greeks even if they bring gifts.</em></li></ul><p> Similar to_equo ne credite_ (“do not trust the horse”). The phrase belongs to Laocoön when he supposedly warned his fellow Trojans against accepting the wooden horse from the Greeks. Nowadays, this expression can be used figuratively between friends.</p><ul><li><strong>Dulce est desipere in loco.</strong> — <em>It is sweet on occasion to play the fool. &#x2F; It is pleasant to relax once in a while.</em></li></ul><p> By Horace in ‘Odes’. Criminally underused genius Latin phrase. I trust you shall change this.</p><ul><li><strong>Audentes fortuna iuvat.</strong> —<em>Fortune favors the bold.</em></li></ul><p> Supposedly Pliny the Elder’s last words before leaving the docks at Pompeii to rescue his friend Pomponianus from the eruption of Vesuvius in 79. The phrase also appears in Virgil’s Aeneid.</p><ul><li><strong>Ita vero.</strong> —<em>Thus indeed.</em></li></ul><p> Funny thing about Romans. Apparently, they had no word for ‘yes’, so they went with_ita vero_ instead.</p><ul><li><strong>Lupus in fabula.</strong> —<em>The wolf in the story.</em></li></ul><p> The Latin equivalent of “speak of the devil”. When you speak of someone and they suddenly appear, almost as if you were summoning them, this proverb is perfect.</p><ul><li><strong>Memento vivere.</strong> —<em>Remember to live.</em></li></ul><p> We all heard about_memento mori_ (“remember that you [have to] die”), but apparently a more optimistic view over life also existed.</p><ul><li><strong>Risus abundat in ore stultorum.</strong> —<em>Laughter is abundant in the mouth of fools.</em></li></ul><p> Similar to_per risum multum poteris cognoscere stultum_ (“by excessive laughter one can recognize the fool”). Do you have that one friend who laughs at their own jokes even before saying them? If yes, then this saying is for them. Only if they are not easily offended, of course.</p><ul><li><strong>Surdo oppedere.</strong> —<em>To belch before the deaf.</em></li></ul><p> You gotta love the Latin language. After learning of this phrase’s existence, I no longer regarded my attempt to learn as many Latin phrases as possible as futile.</p><p> If it wasn’t obvious enough,<em>surdo oppedere</em> refers to a useless action.</p><ul><li><strong>Aut Caesar aut nihil.</strong> —<em>Either Caesar or nothing.</em></li></ul><p> Or “all or nothing”. This was the personal motto of the infamous Italian cardinal Cesare Borgia. Nowadays, the expression can be used to denote the absolute aspiration to be the best.</p><ul><li><strong>Mortuum flagellas.</strong> —<em>You are flogging a dead man.</em></li></ul><p> Have you ever criticized someone who did not feel remorse over their actions? This phrase is exactly about that but said in a much more creative and interesting way. Gotta remember this one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/latin-words-960x640.jpg"                      alt="latin words" title="50 Popular Latin Phrases To Impress Your Friends 9"                ></p><p> “Roman statue” by engin akyurt©</p><h2 id="Latin-Words-and-Phrases-for-Love"><a href="#Latin-Words-and-Phrases-for-Love" class="headerlink" title="Latin Words and Phrases for Love"></a>Latin Words and Phrases for Love</h2><p> To conclude our exploration of the Latin phrases in a positive tone, let’s see what the Romans had to say about love. It’s true they talked more about wars, but you don’t need that kind of negativity in your life, do you? Why <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn Latin phrases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> about war, when love wins no matter what?</p><ul><li><strong>Si vis amari ama.</strong> —<em>If you want to be loved, love.</em></li></ul><p> Written by Seneca in the sixth of his letters to Lucilius. The phrase has a double interpretation: ‘only loving souls can inspire love’ and ‘you cannot ask for love from those you do not love yourself’.</p><ul><li><strong>Amor vincit omnia.</strong> —<em>Love conquers all.</em></li></ul><p> Famously attributed to the Latin poet Virgil, this popular Latin phrase is also the title of a painting by the Italian Baroque artist Caravaggio.</p><ul><li><strong>Ubi amor, ibi dolor.</strong> —<em>Where (there is) love, there (is) pain.</em></li></ul><p> No matter how beautiful, love can also hurt. This expression refers to the pain love can inflict upon one’s soul especially if we’re talking about unrequited love.</p><ul><li><strong>Amor et melle et felle est fecundissimus.</strong> —<em>Love is rich with both honey and venom.</em></li></ul><p> It seems that love was no different in Ancient Rome. This quote appeared in Titus Maccius Plautus’ play ‘Cistellaria’.</p><ul><li><strong>Hei mihi! Quod nullis amor est medicabilis herbis.</strong> —<em>Oh me! Love can not be cured by herbs.</em></li></ul><p>From Ovid’s ‘Metamorphoses’.

While Latin is the common ancestor of the Romance languages, it has also influenced the Germanic languages (of which English is a part). So it might prove most illuminating to take inspiration from the master orators and use Latin words and phrases in your day-to-day conversations.</p><p> Besides, Latin can prepare you for many professions or simply discussions with scholarly people. These fields include law, medicine, science, music, theology, philosophy, art, and literature. Many scholars believe that learning Latin also sharpens the mind and cultivates analysis and attention.</p><p> Furthermore, the Latin language is rich in life lessons, mottos and words to live by.

As the lingua franca of the Roman Empire, Latin not only shaped the empire’s legal constructs but also left a lasting imprint on the evolution of legal systems, especially within Europe. As Roman law became the foundation for many modern legal codes, Latin legal words were passed on throughout history until the present day. This incorporation of Latin words in law ensures a degree of precision and continuity, bridging legal concepts across different eras and jurisdictions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37100474&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://awario.com/images/pages/index/img-leads-1280@1x.avif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Why-are-Latin-words-powerful"><a href="#Why-are-Latin-words-powerful" class="headerlink" title="Why are Latin words powerful?"></a>Why are Latin words powerful?</h3><p> Latin words are perceived as powerful most probably in relation to the Roman Empire, a civilization of immense historical influence and achievement. Additionally, Latin words may be considered powerful thanks to their ability to convey complex legal, scientific, and philosophical concepts succinctly. Their use in various specialized fields has endowed them with a sense of authority and timelessness, allowing for clear and unambiguous communication across different languages and cultures.</p><p> In conclusion, dropping one or two cool Latin words here and there will add at least 50 points to your coolness level.

To be more precise, there’s the mother tongue, which is the official language, but also different accents and a lot of pronunciations depending on the locale.

Interested in reading and speaking Arabic as a beginner? Start with the Arabic alphabet! Then, as you progress from letters to words, you may be on the lookout for some <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Arabic words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for beginners. The Arabic alphabet is what you would call an <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad" >abjad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  , meaning that it’s primarily made up of consonants and no vowels. Keep in mind that there are 28 letters in the alphabet, only one of them being a vowel.</p><p> So, when you encounter a written word there will be no way of knowing how to pronounce it unless you’ve heard it before. And this is where Mondly comes in handy! We provide you with real-life conversations, a speech recognition chatbot, and quality recordings. You’ll get used to Arabic words in no time. Ok, final note, you write from left to right, not the other way around.</p><h3 id="Learn-how-to-use-an-Arabic-dictionary"><a href="#Learn-how-to-use-an-Arabic-dictionary" class="headerlink" title="Learn how to use an Arabic dictionary"></a>Learn how to use an Arabic dictionary</h3><p> Ah, one of the most trusted friends of any language learner, the dictionary is here to save the day yet again. But, with Arabic things will be a little more complicated. So, in an Arabic dictionary, the words will be organized around roots made up of three letters. With me so far?</p><p> In order to find a word, you need to already know its root and the letter that the root starts with, and this letter is not always the first letter in the word. So yeah, learning to use the dictionary will take some practice, but once you’ve mastered it will make things much simpler.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097467/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097467"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097467"                      border="0" alt="" width="640" height="640"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097467/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Start-practicing-and-speaking"><a href="#Start-practicing-and-speaking" class="headerlink" title="Start practicing and speaking"></a>Start practicing and speaking</h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296685&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2022/video-pp/ScreenshotSlider/Nero-Video-Advanced-editing.JPG"                      border="0"                >Simple and intuitive video editing<br>🎬 Nero Video:<br>The powerful video editing program for your Windows PC</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/coworkers-talking-960x640.jpg"                      alt="coworkers talking" title="Arabic For Beginners: A Step By Step Guide 3"                ></p><p> ‘Coworkers’ by Mikhail Nilov©</p><p> Now that you know the basics, it’s high time you started using them.

A single word is all you need to receive dozens of smiles. Greek people are known for their hospitality and good mood, but your attempt to speak Greek will multiply that by 100. <strong>A heartfelt_efcharistó_ (‘thanks’) can truly work wonders.</strong> But what are all the other ways to express gratitude in Greek depending on the context?</p><p> Even in English, there is more than one way to say ‘<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >thank you <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ’. It’s only natural to expect the same from Greek. It all depends on the context, who you are talking to, what are thanking them for and how well you know that person. It all seems so complicated now, but it won’t be once you read on.</p><p> In this quick Greek lesson, we’ll show you only the practical ways to say thank you in Greek. The thanks you’ll actually need and use in real life. Additionally, we’ll also go over how to say ‘please’ or ‘you’re welcome’ in Greek. As a result, you’ll know exactly what to say and when to say it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4576829&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9e740b84bb48a64dde25061566299467/products/copy_1_jp_box_big.png"                      border="0"                >Jet Profiler for MySQL, Enterprise Version： Jet Profiler for MySQL is real-time query performance and diagnostics tool for the MySQL database server.

Most Greek people speak English and won’t expect you to be fluent in Greek.</p><p> However, if you want to say more than just ‘thanks’, <strong>you can say σ’ ευχαριστώ_(s’ efcharistó)_ which is ‘thank you’ in Greek.</strong> Although informal_, s’ efcharistó_ is more similar to ‘thank you’ and can be used safely when giving thanks to friends or colleagues.</p><p> If you are especially thankful to them, you can also say ευχαριστώ πολύ_(efcharistó poli)_ which means ‘thanks a lot’. Or even ευχαριστώ πάρα πολύ_(efcharistó para poli)_ meaning ‘thank you very much’.</p><h2 id="The-formal-‘thank-you’-in-Greek"><a href="#The-formal-‘thank-you’-in-Greek" class="headerlink" title="The formal ‘thank you’ in Greek"></a>The formal ‘thank you’ in Greek</h2><p> When it comes to formality, everything you have to do is to switch to the plural form. If you are talking to someone older, someone you don’t know or maybe even a group of people, you can say <strong>σας ευχαριστώ_(sas efcharistó)_ .</strong> Since English doesn’t have any formal pronouns, there’s no easy way to literally translate this, but it would mean something along the lines of “thank you to all of you”.</p><p> Similarly, ευχαριστώ πολύ (efcharistó poli) becomes σας ευχαριστώ πολύ_(sas efcharistó poli)_ and ευχαριστώ πάρα πολύ (efcharistó para poli) becomes σας ευχαριστώ πάρα πολύ_(sas efcharistó para poli)._</p><p> Easy enough, isn’t it? Once you know all the informal, singular ‘thanks’, all you have to do to make them formal is to add the polite plural σας_(sas)_ in front of them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17728032&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner920x120.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/thanks-in-greek-960x720.jpg"                      alt="taverna in Greece" title="All The Best Ways To Say Thank You In Greek 3"                ></p><p> “Mýkonos, Greece” by Johnny Chen©</p><h2 id="Examples-of-Greek-thanks"><a href="#Examples-of-Greek-thanks" class="headerlink" title="Examples of Greek thanks"></a>Examples of Greek thanks</h2><p> Now you know the best ways to say thank you in Greek.

If you want to say ‘please’ in Greek, you say παρακαλώ_(parakaló)._ If you want to say ‘you’re welcome’, παρακαλώ_(parakaló)_ works just fine again. If only everything would be so easy when learning Greek!</p><p> But let’s not get ahead of ourselves and forget about the formal variation. To address someone older or a group of people, you should use the formal σας παρακαλούμε_(sas parakaloúme)_ . Did you recognize the_σας (sas)_ particle? If yes, then congratulations!

Excessive use of politeness can be seen as either weird or mocking especially in Athens, where the basic interaction and attitude resembles that of metropolises like New York or London.

This includes discussing various subjects, and one area that is particularly valuable in this sense is the human body. Knowing the names of<strong>the parts of the body in French</strong> is useful not only for shopping sprees or for a doctor’s consult.

Numbers are an essential part of the vocabulary and can pop up in conversation more often than you think. Whether you are counting pretzels, buying beers for your_drei_ (‘three’) friends, or giving someone your phone number, German numbers will always come in handy while in a German-speaking country.</p><p> Besides, contrary to the popular belief that <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >German is hard to learn <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , German numbers are actually easy to master. In fact, it’s just as easy to learn how to count in German as it is in English. Once you know how to count to 20, the rest of the numbers will follow a predictable pattern. So here’s an uncomplicated guide on how to count from 1 to 100 in German.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=27889512&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/728__90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="German-Numbers-1-10"><a href="#German-Numbers-1-10" class="headerlink" title="German Numbers 1-10"></a>German Numbers 1-10</h2><p> Let’s start at the very beginning. If you want to master the German numbers fast, it’s essential to first learn<strong>how to count to 10 in German.</strong> The numbers from 1 to 10 are important for two reasons. First: you will probably use them on a daily basis. And second: they set the stage for any German number you can think of.</p><p><strong>The German numbers from 0 to 10 are:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>zero —<em>null</em></strong></li><li><strong>one —<em>eins</em></strong></li><li><strong>two —<em>zwei</em></strong></li><li><strong>three —<em>drei</em></strong></li><li><strong>four —<em>vier</em></strong></li><li><strong>five —<em>fünf</em></strong></li><li><strong>six —<em>sechs</em></strong></li><li><strong>seven —<em>sieben</em></strong></li><li><strong>eight —<em>acht</em></strong></li><li><strong>nine —<em>neun</em></strong></li><li><strong>ten —<em>zehn</em></strong></li></ul><p> If you are not familiar with the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >German pronunciation rules <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you can watch this short video to hear how each number from 1 to 10 is pronounced:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863039/11832" target="_top" id="863039"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863039"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="German-Numbers-11-20"><a href="#German-Numbers-11-20" class="headerlink" title="German Numbers 11-20"></a>German Numbers 11-20</h2><p> As it happens with several other languages, the numbers from 11 to 20 don’t yet follow the pattern we talked about. The same as in English, ‘eleven’ and ‘twelve’ are two rebels refusing to follow the crowd. Otherwise, all the other numbers are formed by bringing together the first four letters of the basic 3 to 9 numbers and the word_zehn_ meaning ‘ten’.</p><p> <strong>The German numbers from 11 to 20 are:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>eleven —<em>elf</em></strong></li><li><strong>twelve —<em>zwölf</em></strong></li><li><strong>thirteen —<em>dreizehn</em></strong></li><li><strong>fourteen —<em>vierzehn</em></strong></li><li><strong>fifteen —<em>fünfzehn</em></strong></li><li><strong>sixteen —<em>sechzehn</em></strong></li><li><strong>seventeen —<em>siebzehn</em></strong></li><li><strong>eighteen —<em>achtzehn</em></strong></li><li><strong>nineteen —<em>neunzehn</em></strong></li><li><strong>twenty —<em>zwanzig</em></strong></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="German-multiples-of-10"><a href="#German-multiples-of-10" class="headerlink" title="German multiples of 10"></a>German multiples of 10</h2><p> The next step in learning how to count in German is mastering the tens or the multiples of 10. Once you know these, you be able to apply the pattern and easily count to 100 on your own. It’s as easy as_eins, zwei, drei!_</p><p>Here are the multiples of 10 in German:</p><ul><li><strong>ten —<em>zehn</em></strong></li><li><strong>twenty —<em>zwanzig</em></strong></li><li><strong>thirty — <em>dreißig</em></strong></li><li><strong>forty —</strong> <em><strong>vier</strong> zig</em></li><li><strong>fifty —</strong> <em><strong>fünf</strong> zig</em></li><li><strong>sixty —</strong> <em><strong>sech</strong> zig</em></li><li><strong>seventy —</strong> <em><strong>sieb</strong> zig</em></li><li><strong>eighty —</strong> <em><strong>acht</strong> zig</em></li><li><strong>ninety —</strong> <em><strong>neun</strong> zig</em></li><li><strong>hundred —</strong> <em>hundert</em></li></ul><p> As you can see, even the tens follow a pattern. Apart from twenty and thirty which are exceptions, the tens from forty to ninety are formed by adding “zig” at the end of the first four letters of the numbers from 4 to 9.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072199/17885" target="_top" id="2072199"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072199"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072199/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/count-in-german.png"                      alt="count in german" title="German Numbers: Learn How To Count From 1 To 100 In German 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2048972/16384" target="_top" id="2048972"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2048972"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2048972/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-count-from-1-to-100-in-German"><a href="#How-to-count-from-1-to-100-in-German" class="headerlink" title="How to count from 1 to 100 in German"></a>How to count from 1 to 100 in German</h2><p> Now that you have all the data (the numbers from 1 to 20 and multiples of 10), it’s time to explain how all the other numbers are formed. If you already know how to count in other languages, German numbers will be a piece of cake for you!</p><p> <strong>The only difference from English is that German puts the ones before the tens.</strong>   <strong>Therefore, instead of saying “eighty-two”, you’ll say_zweiundachtzig_ – literally “two-and-eighty”.</strong> Let’s add some dashes to make it easier to read and look at the word again: <em><strong>zwei-und-achtzig</strong> .</em></p><p> The_und_ in the middle stands for “and”. Makes sense, right?</p><p>Now let’s look at some examples to make sure you got it:</p><ul><li><strong>twenty-four —<em>vierundzwanzig</em></strong></li><li><strong>thirty-seven —<em>siebenunddreiβig</em></strong></li><li><strong>forty-two —<em>zweiundvierzig</em></strong></li><li><strong>fifty-six —<em>sechsundfünfzig</em></strong></li><li><strong>sixty-one —<em>einundsechzig</em></strong></li><li><strong>seventy-three —<em>dreiundsiebzig</em></strong></li><li><strong>eighty-five —<em>fünfundachtzig</em></strong></li><li><strong>ninety-eight —<em>achtundneunzig</em></strong></li></ul><p> German is famous for its long compound words, so larger numbers can get a bit overwhelming. Don’t worry though! Adding dashes or spaces will always make them easier to read.</p><p> Don’t forget that practice makes perfect, so next time you can’t fall asleep, counting sheep in German might be a good idea.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/german-numbers/&t=German+Numbers:+Learn+How+to+Count+from+1+to+100+in+German"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3546200&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.binteko.com/sites/default/files/banner01_468x60a.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="From-0-to-100-and-beyond-in-German"><a href="#From-0-to-100-and-beyond-in-German" class="headerlink" title="From 0 to 100 and beyond in German"></a>From 0 to 100 and beyond in German</h3><p> Do you want to go beyond numbers and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >speak German <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> fluently?

Being able to speak foreign languages is the first step to upgrading your brain, adding social skills and broadening your horizons. Exchanging information with a stranger in a different language can be a very fulfilling experience. It’s as if you would get to step into a whole different world.</p><p> In terms of numbers, learning foreign languages has become a widespread activity for the majority of people, with English holding the number one spot in foreign languages learned in the EU followed by <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >French <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >German <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  . This is a trend that is likely to continue for years to come. It is evolving, changing, faster than we as humans are. Whether it’s self-study books, regular classes or mobile apps, learning a new language is a trend without an expiration date. But what does the future hold for language learning?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.emeditor.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4631722&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/frontpage2-2048x588.webp"                      border="0"                >EmEditor Professional (Lifetime License, non-store app)</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Learning-languages-in-the-past"><a href="#Learning-languages-in-the-past" class="headerlink" title="Learning languages in the past"></a><strong>Learning languages in the past</strong></h2><p> The traditional ways of learning are those where one learns from someone else. The most important factor was the human interaction, but as you will see further, the substitutes of this method are taking things to a whole new level.</p><p> We also used to learn from books. Writing has also been one of our defining activities as humans. They were widespread, translated, re-translated and brought into the classroom to help the students. But what did they lack? Well, first we could mention interactivity. You had no feedback from books, nor do you have it now. The downside? Books are boring, and they don’t offer any feedback whatsoever.</p><p> In the past,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learning a foreign language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was seen as something high-level. Knowing multiple foreign languages was an advantage, as it proved you were highly educated and well-traveled. This sort of people would show off their abilities at social gatherings and amaze everybody in the audience. If apart from English, you spoke French, German and Italian, you were the star of any type of group meeting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296740&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/biu/Nero_BackItUp_Screen_2.webp"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pexels-photo-46274.jpg"                      alt="pexels photo 46274" title="The Best Way To Learn A Foreign Language In The 21St Century 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-office-pdf-editor-1x.890dbda.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Learning-a-foreign-language-with-the-help-of-technology"><a href="#Learning-a-foreign-language-with-the-help-of-technology" class="headerlink" title="Learning a foreign language with the help of technology"></a>Learning a foreign language with the help of technology</h2><p> Times have changed. Learning has changed. Nowadays, with the boom of technology, methods of learning a language have become more diverse. While the classic teacher-to-student approach is still the norm, other methods have made their way into our world. Technological advancements are now filling the gaps in the regular type of learning.</p><p> We are now facing a transition phrase with new technologies making their way into our lives. Teachers now use devices to enhance our learning experience. From online teaching methods to videos and mobile apps; they all help the modern learner be engaged and fully attentive. As a result, we find it <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >easier to learn a foreign language in the 21st <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> century than ever before.</p><p> This exciting new modern era brings out the idea that one can learn on their own.

A few sessions of learning a week will help you improve your skills, especially if you choose speaking and pronunciation exercises.

Our population numbers are increasing, and so are our demands for learning. Now you learn from the comfort of your home, at your own pace, with your own capabilities. People are getting more and more excited about mixing learning with comfort. And so we see a world where people with access to technological devices (maybe smaller, flatter and more affordable?) will no longer go to classes but have classes come to them in an electronic form. The future of learning languages is thus a bright, fast one. Let’s all hope we get to see this evolution!</p><p> The fact is that languages evolve together with technology. Regular classes and books are trying to keep up, but they are losing the race. We already have <strong>free lessons online, language applications, YouTube lessons,</strong> and so on. In the end, what makes the difference is quality and effectiveness. All you have to do is choose wisely!</p><p> In the 21st Century, you have all the tools and platforms needed to successfully learn a new language. Also, with more opportunities to travel and explore the world, you will be able to put your skills to good use and become a citizen of the world.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/the-best-way-learn-a-foreign-language-in-21st-century/&t=The+Best+Way+to+Learn+a+Foreign+Language+in+the+21st+Century"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><p><a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-502&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-502&utm_source=blog-post-id-502&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-502&utm_source=blog-post-id-502&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-502&utm_source=blog-post-id-502&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-502&mt=8"  title="Learn with Mondly">Learn with Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-effortless-electronic-exchange-5-secure-pathways-to-your-pc/"><u>[New] In 2024, Effortless Electronic Exchange  5 Secure Pathways to Your PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-from-still-photos-to-dynamic-video-how-to-use-your-cellular-device/"><u>[New] In 2024, From Still Photos to Dynamic Video  How To Use Your Cellular Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-ideal-screen-capturing-solutions-for-igadgets/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Ideal Screen Capturing Solutions for iGadgets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-master-commanders-unleashed-ranking-7-total-war-champions/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Master Commanders Unleashed  Ranking 7 Total War Champions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-optimizing-your-project-b-roll-utilization-tips/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Optimizing Your Project  B-Roll Utilization Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-record-vlc-webcam-footage-recording/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Record VLC  Webcam Footage Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-step-by-step-guide-to-elevating-video-presence-through-thumbnails/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Step-by-Step Guide to Elevating Video Presence Through Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-pcandroid-friendly-methods-to-post-videos-on-facebook-successfully/"><u>[Updated] PC/Android-Friendly Methods to Post Videos on Facebook Successfully</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-secrets-to-producing-visually-appealing-fb-promos-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Secrets to Producing Visually Appealing FB Promos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/1719576468399-2022-start-fluently-with-a-95-off-language-quest/"><u>2022: Start Fluently with a 95%% Off Language Quest!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/50-years-of-europes-voices-celebrating-linguistic-babel/"><u>50 Years of Europe’s Voices -

French books for beginners are a great way to get used to the language, learn new French words and start to regard the language as if it were your mother tongue. Not into reading? Fear not. Reading in French is just as effective for your vocabulary, even if you read just short stories or comic books.</p><h2 id="The-Best-French-Novels-for-Beginners"><a href="#The-Best-French-Novels-for-Beginners" class="headerlink" title="The Best French Novels for Beginners"></a>The Best French Novels for Beginners</h2><ol><li><em>Le Petit Prince</em> (The Little Prince) by Antoine de Saint Exupéry</li><li><em>Le Petit Nicolas</em> (Little Nicholas) by René Goscinny</li><li><em>L’Étranger</em> (The Stranger) by Albert Camus</li><li><em>Oscar et la dame rose</em> (Oscar and the Lady in Pink) by Éric-Emmanuel Schmitt</li><li><em>Astérix le Gaulois</em> (Astérix le Gaulois) by René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo</li><li><em>Les Aventures de Tintin</em> (The Adventures of Tintin) by Hergé</li><li><em>Arsène Lupin, Gentleman-Cambrioleur</em> (Arsène Lupin, Gentleman Thief) by Maurice Leblanc</li><li><em>Bonjour Tristesse</em> (Hello Sadness) by Françoise Sagan</li><li><em>Le Château de ma mère</em> (My Mother’s Castle) by Marcel Pagnol</li><li><em>Les Misérables</em> (The Miserables) by Victor Hugo</li><li><em>Vingt Mille Lieues sous les mers</em> (Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas) by Jules Verne</li><li><em>Le scaphandre et le papillon</em> (The Diving Bell and the Butterfly) by Jean-Dominique Bauby</li><li><em>Les Trois Mousquetaires</em>  (The Three Musketeers) by Alexandre Dumas</li><li><em>Le Rouge et le Noir</em>  (The Red and the Black) by Stendhal</li><li><em>Madame Bovary</em>  by Gustave Flaubert</li><li><em>Le Comte de Monte-Cristo</em> (The Count of Monte Cristo) by Alexandre Dumas</li></ol><p> If you’re a<strong>beginner eager to read in French,</strong> it’s best to start with the first book on this list of French novels and then progressively work your way through. This approach ensures that as the texts become more complex, your French reading skills will improve accordingly. As a special highlight, the final recommendations are French classics books that everyone should read in their lifetime.</p><p> Naturally, this list is exclusively dedicated to books originally written in French, because reading them in the original language ensures you experience the full depth and nuances, which can sometimes be lost in translation. However, if we’re talking about a very good translation, you can definitely also<strong>read French translations of foreign books.</strong> For instance, after you’ve tackled the first six books on our list, I highly recommend <strong>reading_Harry Potter_ in French.</strong> Targeted at young readers, the initial books in the series are perfectly suited for beginners.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453720/17020" target="_top" id="1453720"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453720"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453720/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/book-in-french-960x640.jpg"                      alt="book in French" title="30+ Best French Books To Read In French 4"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Choose-the-Best-French-Books-for-New-Learners"><a href="#How-to-Choose-the-Best-French-Books-for-New-Learners" class="headerlink" title="How to Choose the Best French Books for New Learners"></a>How to Choose the Best French Books for New Learners</h2><p><strong>The best French novels for new learners</strong> are ones you’ve already read. No, really. Take it from me—a language learner at heart. I perfected my English, Spanish, and French by reading books, and I strongly recommend you do the same to improve your French.</p><p><strong>Reading in French,</strong> if your French is not that good,<strong>can be challenging</strong> at first. That’s why I always suggest starting with a book you have already read in your native language. It could be your favorite book or simply one you want to experience again. Being familiar with the story can significantly ease your first foray into reading a book in French.</p><p> As you progress through the pages, you’ll notice a gradual increase in your familiarity with French. You’ll start to deduce the meanings of unknown words from the context and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn French <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in a natural way. Even better, if you read an<strong>eBook in French</strong> on a Kindle, you can leverage the dictionary feature to learn new words simply by tapping on them.</p><p> After finishing, you can move on to a book you’ve never read before—in any language. However, depending on your French level, I’d suggest opting for a French novel for beginners, like_Le Petit Prince_ (The Little Prince), which is technically a novella.</p><p> Let’s recap.<strong>This is how to start reading in French:</strong></p><ol><li>Read your favorite book first (or just a book you read before) as it will help you get used to reading in French;</li><li>Continue with a short and accessible book that uses simpler language – like <em>Le Petit Prince</em> (The Little Prince);</li><li>Repeat the first two steps with different books if reading in French doesn’t feel like home yet;</li><li>Go on with more complex books, but don’t jump straight to French philosophy! Easy does it.</li></ol><p><strong>The secret to choosing the best books to read in French</strong> is to proceed step by step. Begin with shorter, simpler books that use straightforward language, and gradually progress to longer and more complex French books. Throughout this journey, avoid putting pressure on yourself. Reading should be enjoyable, especially when you pick genres that you love. So, make the most of your French reading experience — it will significantly benefit your French studies!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.advancedwebranking.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4715051&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/14edc6ebfdae2e23bbed83d67f50e983/products/33_awr%20logo.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Top-French-Authors-You-Should-Know"><a href="#Top-French-Authors-You-Should-Know" class="headerlink" title="Top French Authors You Should Know"></a>Top French Authors You Should Know</h2><ul><li>Victor Hugo</li><li>Alexandre Dumas</li><li>Jules Verne</li><li>Gustave Flaubert</li><li>George Sand</li><li>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</li><li>Guy de Maupassant</li><li>Voltaire</li><li>Albert Camus</li><li>Marcel Proust</li><li>Molière</li><li>Jean-Paul Sartre</li><li>Émile Zola</li><li>Stendhal</li><li>Honoré de Balzac</li></ul><p> The history of French literature is rich and extensive. Some of the<strong>world’s most celebrated authors are French,</strong> and you can discover them in this list of top French authors that everyone should know. However, if you want to learn to read French, it’s important to approach it step by step. If you’re just starting out, avoid diving straight into the complex works of Émile Zola or Jean-Paul Sartre. Instead, start with more accessible authors like Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and Victor Hugo. You might not be ready to tackle the<strong>greatest French novels</strong> from day one, but with enough work and patience, you’ll eventually get there.</p><p>Loading poll …</p><p>Coming Soon</p><p> Who’s your favorite French author?</p><p> Victor Hugo  Victor Hugo0 (0 %)</p><p> Alexandre Dumas  Alexandre Dumas1 (20 %)</p><p> Jules Verne  Jules Verne4 (80 %)</p><p> Albert Camus  Albert Camus0 (0 %)</p><p> Gustave Flaubert  Gustave Flaubert0 (0 %)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2201613&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.macdvdripperpro.com/images/devices-3.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Romance-French-Novels-for-Incurable-Romantics"><a href="#Romance-French-Novels-for-Incurable-Romantics" class="headerlink" title="Romance French Novels for Incurable Romantics"></a>Romance French Novels for Incurable Romantics</h2><ul><li><em>L’amant</em> (The Lover) by Marguerite Duras</li><li><em>La Dame aux Camélias</em> (The Lady of the Camellias) by Alexandre Dumas fils</li><li><em>Les Liaisons dangereuses</em> (Dangerous Liaisons) by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos</li><li><em>Chéri</em>  by Colette</li><li><em>Bonjour Tristesse</em> (Hello Sadness) by Françoise Sagan</li><li><em>Notre-Dame de Paris</em> (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame) by Victor Hugo</li><li><em>Un long dimanche de fiançailles</em> (A very long engagement) by Sebastien Japrisot</li><li><em>Suite française</em> by Irène Némorovsky</li><li><em>Le Grandes Meaulnes</em>  by Alain-Fournier</li></ul><p> My number one rule for reading in French as a beginner is simple: read what you love. If that means diving into<strong>French romance novels,</strong> then embrace it! When you’re starting to read in French, there’s no such thing as a ‘bad’ book genre.</p><p> Think about the types of books you enjoy in your native language. If history books aren’t your thing in English, chances are you won’t suddenly find a passion for them in French.</p><p> Let’s be honest—everyone enjoys a captivating romance novel now and then. The fact that it’s in French only adds to the charm, making it a delightful bonus on your journey to learning French!</p><h2 id="Best-French-Short-Stories-for-Bite-Sized-Reading"><a href="#Best-French-Short-Stories-for-Bite-Sized-Reading" class="headerlink" title="Best French Short Stories for Bite-Sized Reading"></a>Best French Short Stories for Bite-Sized Reading</h2><ol><li><em>Short Stories in French for Beginners</em>  by Olly Richards and Richard Simcott</li><li><em>Les Contes de la rue Broca</em> (The Stories of Broca Street) by Pierre Gripari</li><li><em>Les Contes de ma mère l’Oye</em> (Tales of Mother Goose) by Charles Perrault</li><li><em>Contes de la bécasse</em> (Tales of the woodcock) by Guy de Maupassant</li><li><em>Contes du jour et de la nuit</em> (Tales of Day and Night) Guy de Maupassant</li><li><em>La Cafetière et Autres Contes Fantastiques</em> (The Coffee Pot and Other Fantastic Tales) by Théophile Gautier</li><li><em>Les Diaboliques</em> (The Diabolicals) by Barbey d’Aurevilly</li><li><em>Voyage à Marseille</em> (Voyage to Marseille) by Sylvie Lainé</li><li><em>Short Stories in French: New Penguin Parallel Text</em> edited by Richard Coward</li></ol><p> We mentioned we would discuss short stories, didn’t we? Indeed,<strong>French short stories</strong> are an excellent starting point if you’re looking to begin reading in French. They offer a quick and accessible way into the language without requiring hours of commitment, facilitating a smoother transition.</p><p> Whether you’re into reading or not, French short stories are the absolute best choice for beginners.

These are known as Old Latin, Classical Latin, Vulgar Latin (that also influenced the Romance languages), Medieval Latin, Renaissance Latin, New Latin and Contemporary Latin or the Latin we use today in the Catholic Church, in science, mottos, et cetera (“and so forth”).</p><p> Additionally,<strong>Latin has also highly influenced English</strong> through ecclesiastical usage and writers who borrowed words that we still use today.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2092236/16384" target="_top" id="2092236"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2092236"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="329"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2092236/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/latin-language-600x450.jpg"                      alt="latin language" title="This Is The Easiest Way To Learn Latin Online 3"                ></p><p> “Hercules furens” by Seneca.</p><p><em>Ergo</em> , history makes Latin the backbone of many present-day languages and studying it could help you gain valuable insight into the infrastructure of many other languages.</p><h2 id="Latin-grammar-and-the-Latin-alphabet"><a href="#Latin-grammar-and-the-Latin-alphabet" class="headerlink" title="Latin grammar and the Latin alphabet"></a>Latin grammar and the Latin alphabet</h2><p> The Latin alphabet that many languages use today evolved from the visually similar Etruscan alphabet, which – in turn – evolved from the Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician alphabet that derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. As a result of Etruscans ruling early Rome, over time, their alphabet developed into the Latin alphabet that many centuries later became the writing system we all know today.</p><p>A fascinating origin story, isn’t it?</p><p> With three distinct genders, up to seven noun cases, five declensions, four verb conjugations, six tenses, three persons, three moods, two voices, two or three aspects and two numbers, Latin grammar may seem complicated. But once you start your Latin classes with Mondly and learn to read Latin, you’ll be surprised how fast you can actually master this language due to the knowledge you already possess.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698827&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/dex3REpage-newmainscreenshot.png"                      border="0"                >DEX 3 RE is Easy-To-Use DJ Mixing Software for MAC and Windows Designed for Today’s Versatile DJ. </p><p> Mix from your own library of music, iTunes or use the Pulselocker subsciprtion service for in-app access to over 44 million songs.

But studying languages that are completely different from English is not impossible.

Out of these, a third are now endangered. And out of this third, many have less than 1,000 speakers remaining. But what is the oldest of them? What are the oldest languages in the world? What did the first words our ancestors spoke sound like?</p><p> As new evidence resurfaces every day, we can’t yet know what’s the first language ever spoken. But linguists and historians agree that these are<strong>the oldest languages in the world:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Akkadian</strong></li><li><strong>Arabic</strong></li><li><strong>Aramaic</strong></li><li><strong>Chinese</strong></li><li><strong>Egyptian</strong></li><li><strong>Elamite</strong></li><li><strong>Greek</strong></li><li><strong>Hebrew</strong></li><li><strong>Hittite</strong></li><li><strong>Hurrian</strong></li><li><strong>Irish Gaelic</strong></li><li><strong>Latin</strong></li><li><strong>Mycenaean Greek</strong></li><li><strong>Palaic</strong></li><li><strong>Sanskrit</strong></li><li><strong>Sumerian</strong></li><li><strong>Tamil</strong></li></ul><p> Languages have always been fascinating because of the role they played as one of the pillars of civilization on Earth. Imagine a world where beings don’t communicate. What does that world look like? It’s unimaginable. Languages have shaped humanity for ages and continue to do so even today. They are fluid and in a continuous evolution. But their timeless metamorphosis makes it hard for historians and linguists to determine what are the oldest languages in the world.</p><h2 id="What-was-the-first-language-on-Earth"><a href="#What-was-the-first-language-on-Earth" class="headerlink" title="What was the first language on Earth?"></a>What was the first language on Earth?</h2><p> We only know what history tells us. And history says the first spoken language appeared 10,000 years ago. But we can never know for sure because no one was there to confirm. So there is only one way to judge the age of a language: by the earliest proof of its written form. However, this still remains guesswork, as it’s always possible that archaeologists might discover something new tomorrow. Something that could change history as we know it. Furthermore, these ancient languages were surely in use long before they were written in stone or on papyruses. But for how long? It remains a mystery.</p><p> Needless to say, the first human languages were likely simple, consisting of basic sounds and gestures used to communicate basic survival needs such as food, water, and shelter. Over time, these early languages evolved and diversified as human societies grew more complex and began to engage in trade, agriculture, and other activities.</p><p> While<strong>we may never know for sure what the first human language was,</strong> current research suggests that language has been a fundamental part of the human experience for thousands of generations and that it continues to evolve and adapt to our changing world.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/themes/mondly/img/mondly-banner-icon.png"                      alt="mondly banner icon" title="The First &Amp; Oldest Languages Ever Spoken: Origins Of Human Communication 2"                ></p><h5 id="Do-you-want-to-learn-some-of-the-oldest-languages-on-Earth"><a href="#Do-you-want-to-learn-some-of-the-oldest-languages-on-Earth" class="headerlink" title="Do you want to learn some of the oldest languages on Earth?"></a>Do you want to learn some of the oldest languages on Earth?</h5><p> Mondly offers courses in Greek, Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew and even Latin.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-4757&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-4757&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-4757&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-4757&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-4757&mt=8" >Start Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3922934&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/ripperpro.png"                      border="0"                >WonderFox DVD Ripper Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Ancient-languages-the-oldest-dead-languages-on-Earth"><a href="#Ancient-languages-the-oldest-dead-languages-on-Earth" class="headerlink" title="Ancient languages: the oldest dead languages on Earth"></a>Ancient languages: the oldest dead languages on Earth</h2><p><strong>Ancient languages</strong> typically refer to<strong>old extinct languages</strong> that no longer have any speakers.

Thus, given this evidence, Sumerian can also be considered<strong>the first language in the world</strong> or one of the ancient languages.</p><p> Sumerian was gradually replaced by Akkadian as a spoken language around 2000 BC, but it continued to be used as a literary, ceremonial, scientific and sacred language until the 1st century AD. Unknown to the modern world until the 19th century when Assyriologists began deciphering its cuneiform inscriptions, written Sumerian can be divided into several time periods: Archaic Sumerian (31st–26th century BC), Old or Classical Sumerian (26th–23rd century BC), Neo-Sumerian (23rd–21st century BC), Late Sumerian (20th–18th century BC) and Post-Sumerian (after 1700 BC).</p><p>Other ancient languages that are now extinct are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurrian%5Flanguage"><strong>Hurrian</strong></a> – oldest proof of written Hurrian dates back to the 21st century BC;</li><li><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Anatolian-languages/Palaic"><strong>Palaic</strong></a> – attested in cuneiform tablets in Bronze Age Hattusa – circa the 16th century BC;</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian%5Flanguage"><strong>Egyptian</strong></a> – its earliest known complete written sentence has been dated to about 2690 BC;</li><li><strong>Akkadian</strong> – first attested texts from around the mid-3rd-millennium BC;</li><li><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Elamite-language"><strong>Elamite</strong></a> – the earliest Elamite writings use a pictographic script and date from the middle of the 3rd millennium BC;</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anitta"><strong>Hittite</strong></a> – the oldest known text in the Hittite language was written by Anitta, a king that reigned in the 17th century BC;</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear%5FB"><strong>Mycenaean Greek</strong></a> – the most ancient attested form of the Greek language with the earliest writings dating back to 1450 BC.</li></ul><h2 id="10-oldest-living-languages-in-the-world"><a href="#10-oldest-living-languages-in-the-world" class="headerlink" title="10 oldest living languages in the world"></a>10 oldest living languages in the world</h2><p> The same as everything else in the world, languages have a life cycle.

Thus, it’s debatable whether the Greek language we speak today is indeed 3400 years old or not. However, since its roots lie in Mycenaean Greek, we can all agree that Greek is indeed one of the oldest living languages in the world.</p><p> The Greek language holds an important place in history thanks to its rich literature that includes epic poems such as_Iliad_ and_Odyssey_ .

Within a week of its official launch, Mondly VR became the Top Selling Educational App in the store, currently ranking as the #1 solution in VR Education.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Mondly VR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  uses Quest’s microphone to allow you to speak and then evaluates your delivery with the help of speech recognition. In addition to offering a memorable learning experience, <strong>Mondly VR also eliminates the effects of foreign language anxiety</strong>  and helps users refine their speaking skills without fear of embarrassment. Learners can practice real-life scenarios such as making a hotel reservation, taking a taxi, or ordering dinner.</p><p> After going through Oculus’ rigorous selection process, Mondly VR received major improvements to ensure the highest possible quality for Quest users. Featuring dynamic conversations, feedback on pronunciation, and intelligent suggestions, the app aims at being the closest experience to actual immersion.</p><p> With Mondly VR, users can practice 29 languages: English, Spanish, German, French, Italian, and more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/924299/11305" target="_top" id="924299"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-924299"                      border="0" alt="" width="520" height="100"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="VR-is-ready-to-disrupt-education"><a href="#VR-is-ready-to-disrupt-education" class="headerlink" title="VR is ready to disrupt education"></a><strong>VR is ready to disrupt education</strong></h2><p> The VR industry has historically been dedicated to gaming experiences, however, <strong>with Oculus Quest, educational apps are ready to steal the spotlight</strong>  and become part of global learning and development initiatives in organizations worldwide. <a class="link"   href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/emerging-tech/virtual-reality-study.html" >PwC recently conducted a study <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  showcasing the spectacular benefits of workplace training in VR. The research followed the outcomes of a soft skills training in a US-based organization, involving three learning modalities: classroom, e-learning, and VR. The outcomes were staggering, VR learners being up to <strong>4 times faster to train</strong> than in the classroom setting, and <strong>275% more confident</strong>  to apply the learned skills at their workplace. In addition to this, the VR learners were <strong>3.75 times more emotionally connected</strong> to the content and <strong>4 times more focused</strong> than their peers.</p><p> To better understand how the human brain responds to VR,  the University of Maryland’s College of Computer, Mathematical and Natural Sciences conducted a study  revealing that VR is more effective in acquiring skills due to its ability to enhance the neural connections needed for learning. As a result of the lifelike environments that learners experience, language immersion and simulations are easily accessible to everyone, changing the whole dynamic of education and enabling students to gain practical experience in numerous fields without the burden of logistics.</p><p> The first VR experience Mondly launched in 2017 has 100,000 users to date and is the most referenced VR language learning app in the academic space. 100+ research articles highlight its impact in advancing language learning.   <strong>VR creates a perfect environment for acquiring new skills at a 4 times faster rate compared to traditional learning methods.</strong></p><p> “Our continuous involvement in VR development and science-backed learning methodologies enables us to pioneer solutions for personal development, workforce training, and K-12 education, changing the way language learning is perceived across the world. We always promoted VR as the most effective way to learn and we hope to inspire more developers to enhance 21st-century learning.  Mondly’s mission is to advance the way people learn languages through cutting-edge technologies. This is why we brought Mondly VR to Quest,” said Alexandru Iliescu, CEO and Co-Founder at Mondly.   <strong>“VR is no longer just a form of entertainment, but a powerful tool for acquiring skills.</strong>  Our goal for this decade is to push the boundaries of VR language learning and open new horizons for personal improvement and workforce training.”</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/mondly-vr-oculus-quest/&t=Mondly+Launched+the+First-Ever+Language+App+on+Oculus+Quest"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="About-Mondly"><a href="#About-Mondly" class="headerlink" title="About Mondly"></a><strong>About Mondly</strong></h2><p> Being named “App of the Year” by Facebook, “Best New App” by Apple, and “Editors’ Choice” by Google Play, Mondly is a leading language learning platform with 80 million learners worldwide.

Home to a plethora of languages, many of which belong to the vast Indo-European language family, Europe boasts a rich linguistic landscape that plays a crucial role in shaping its cultural identity. To understand how multilingualism promotes unity and cooperation on the continent, let’s explore the endlessly fascinating languages of Europe.</p><p> Join us for Europe Day (and beyond) in this fantastic quest through the Indo-European languages. During this linguistic quest, we will make several stops:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.absolute.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4601998&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ef70e26a0b5da778eda3f48014d087cd/728x90_larger-shield.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-do-we-celebrate-Europe-Day"><a href="#Why-do-we-celebrate-Europe-Day" class="headerlink" title="Why do we celebrate Europe Day?"></a>Why do we celebrate Europe Day?</h2><p> According to the European Union,<strong>Europe Day celebrates peace and unity in Europe.</strong> May 9th marks the anniversary of the historic ‘Schuman Declaration’, an ambitious plan that suggested a new way for European countries to work together, making war between them impossible. Schuman’s proposal is widely regarded as the genesis of the present-day European Union.</p><p> Europe Day also serves as a reminder of the importance of unity, cultural diversity, and the shared values that bind the European community together.</p><h3 id="Historical-context"><a href="#Historical-context" class="headerlink" title="Historical context"></a>Historical context</h3><p> In 1950, European countries were recovering from World War II, which ended five years earlier. To prevent another devastating war, European governments decided to combine their coal and steel production. This would make war between France and Germany practically impossible, and it was believed that joining economic interests would improve living standards and create a more united Europe.</p><p> The Schuman Declaration, presented by French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman on May 9, 1950, proposed the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). The ECSC, with founding members France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Belgium <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and Luxembourg, was the first in a series of European institutions that eventually evolved into today’s European Union.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://getlyla.pxf.io/c/5597632/1455723/15391" target="_top" id="1455723"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15391-1455723"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1455723/15391"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="European-language-families-and-branches"><a href="#European-language-families-and-branches" class="headerlink" title="European language families and branches"></a>European language families and branches</h2><p> Europe is home to several major language families, the most prominent being the<strong>Indo-European language family.</strong> Other significant language families include Uralic, Turkic, and Basque, each contributing to the rich linguistic landscape of the continent.</p><p> Comprising over 400 languages spoken by over 45% of the world’s population, it is believed that <strong>Indo-European languages originated from a hypothetical language called Proto-Indo-European,</strong> which is no longer in use.</p><p> It seems that the earliest speakers of Proto-Indo-European originally lived around today’s Ukraine and the nearby regions in the Caucasus and Southern Russia. What allowed the language to spread so far and wide was, interestingly enough, the people’s success in domesticating cattle, dogs, and, above all, horses. This allowed them to distribute the language across Eurasia on their horses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/europe-language-960x558.jpg"                      alt="&#39;Europe languages&#39; by Joseph Daniel©" title="The Fascinating World Of Indo-European And Other Languages Of Europe 6"                ></p><p> Because Proto-Indo-European speakers didn’t create a writing system, we don’t have any written records of their language. Linguists have tried to recreate this ancient language using different methods. Even though a perfect reconstruction may not be possible, we still have a general idea of the language and culture these early speakers shared.</p><p> Today, Indo-European languages are widely spoken in the Americas, Europe and Western and Southern Asia.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4728277&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/1_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Branches-of-Indo-European-languages"><a href="#Branches-of-Indo-European-languages" class="headerlink" title="Branches of Indo-European languages"></a>Branches of Indo-European languages</h3><p> The Indo-European language family is, in turn, divided into several branches, each consisting of a group of related languages. Here are some of the major Indo-European branches:</p><ol><li><strong>Indo-Iranian:</strong> This is the largest branch of the Indo-European family. It includes two major sub-branches: Indic and Iranian. Indic languages include <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Hindi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Bengali, Punjabi, Urdu, and many others spoken in India and Pakistan. Sanskrit is the most popular among the early languages of this sub-branch. Iranian <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >languages include Persian <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Farsi), Pashto, and Kurdish, primarily spoken in Iran, Afghanistan, and other parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.</li><li><strong>Greek:</strong> The sole member of its branch, Greek is a dialect group rather than a branch of languages. The earliest surviving evidence of a Greek language were Mycenaean writings found in Crete.</li><li><strong>Italic:</strong> Latin is the most well-known language in this branch. Other languages, such as Faliscan, Sabellic, Umbrian, South Picene, and Oscan, were once part of this branch, but they have all become extinct. <strong>Today, the Romance languages are the sole surviving descendants of the Italic branch.</strong></li><li><strong>Celtic:</strong> The same as Indo-Iranian, this branch includes two sub-branches: Continental Celtic and Insular Celtic. Continental Celtic languages were absorbed by Latin, but geographical isolation helped the Insular Celtic sub-branch flourish in the British Isles. As a result, the Celtic languages spoken today are Irish Gaelic, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, Cornish, and Breton.</li><li><strong>Germanic:</strong> The Germanic branch has three sub-branches: East Germanic, which is now extinct; North Germanic, which includes Old Norse, the origin of modern Scandinavian languages; and West Germanic, which has Old English, Old Saxon, and Old High German.</li><li><strong>Balto-Slavic:</strong> This branch consists of two sub-branches: Baltic and Slavic. While only two Baltic languages survive today (Latvian and Lithuanian), the Slavic sub-branch has a plethora of surviving languages spoken mostly in Eastern Europe. Some of these are Russian, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Bulgarian, Serbian,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Croatian <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Bosnian, Slovene, Macedonian, and Ukrainian.</li><li><strong>Anatolian:</strong> Predominant in some areas of Syria and the Asian side of Turkey. The most famous language of this branch is Hittite. However, all the Anatolian languages as currently extinct.</li><li><strong>Armenian:</strong> The Armenian language is the sole member of its branch within the Indo-European language family.</li><li><strong>Albanian:</strong> The official language of Albania and Kosovo, Albanian forms its own distinct branch within the Indo-European language family. The same as Armenian and Tocharian, its origin story is still surrounded by mystery.</li><li><strong>Tocharian:</strong> Spoken farthest to the east among all Indo-European languages, this branch is completely extinct.</li></ol><p> All these branches reflect the vast geographic spread and historical development of the Indo-European languages. Who would have guessed Romance languages and Indic languages come from the same European language family? The linguistic diversity found within this influential language family is incredible, to say the least.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4599952&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="864" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVnfr5HudQw" title="The Latest and Easiest Solution to Remove Kindle DRM on Windows (without Degrading)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>Epubor Ultimate for Mac:Helps you read books anywhere, including the best eBook Converter + eBook DRM Removal functions.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/themes/mondly/img/mondly-banner-icon.png"                      alt="mondly banner icon" title="The Fascinating World Of Indo-European And Other Languages Of Europe 7"                ></p><h5 id="Language-learning-made-easy"><a href="#Language-learning-made-easy" class="headerlink" title="Language learning made easy"></a>Language learning made easy</h5><p> Build practical language skills for real life with Mondly.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-7974&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-7974&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-7974&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-7974&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-7974&mt=8" >Start Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Indo-European-vs-Non-Indo-European-Languages-in-Europe"><a href="#Indo-European-vs-Non-Indo-European-Languages-in-Europe" class="headerlink" title="Indo-European vs Non-Indo-European Languages in Europe"></a>Indo-European vs Non-Indo-European Languages in Europe</h2><p> Are there any Non-Indo-European languages in Europe? Yes, Turkish and Finnish are the most prominent of them. However, this is not the complete list.</p><p> As you saw in the previous paragraphs, Indo-European languages extend far beyond Europe.

The vast majority is represented by the aforementioned Indo-European languages, which are equally intricate and diverse.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033101&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Elite.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Most-Spoken-Languages-in-Europe"><a href="#Most-Spoken-Languages-in-Europe" class="headerlink" title="Most Spoken Languages in Europe"></a>Most Spoken Languages in Europe</h2><p> With an abundance of languages in Europe, determining the best one to learn can be a challenge. Sure, Europeans are known for their good command of English, but what’s the next best language to learn? If you want to travel or even work in Europe, surely the most practical to learn is the most spoken. To help you decide, let’s look at the<strong>top five most spoken languages in Europe.</strong> By number of native speakers, of course.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12730965&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://incomedia.eu/files/images/affiliates/w5/03_WBSX5_728x90_red_CTA.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Russian"><a href="#1-Russian" class="headerlink" title="1. Russian"></a>1. Russian</h3><p> Given its wide territory, Russian is the most spoken native language in Europe. With more or less<strong>130 million native speakers</strong> on the European continent, Russian is the official language of Russia and Belarus. Additionally, many older people in Eastern Europe speak Russian because it was taught in schools during the Soviet Era.</p><p> Many people avoid learning Russian because of the Cyrillic alphabet. However, that shouldn’t stop you too. The <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Russian alphabet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is actually easy to master once you get the hang of it!</p><h3 id="2-German"><a href="#2-German" class="headerlink" title="2. German"></a>2. German</h3><p> With roughly<strong>95 million native speakers</strong> in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg and Lichtenstein, German sits in the second spot on our list. While many people consider German hard to learn, they are not quite right. It may be a tad more difficult, but not the hardest and certainly not impossible. According to the FSI (Foreign Service Institute) of the US government, an English speaker would need about 750 class hours or 30 weeks of practice to become fluent in German.</p><h3 id="3-French"><a href="#3-French" class="headerlink" title="3.

Still, its influence in Europe remains just as strong, with no less than 67 million native speakers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/european-languages-960x720.jpg"                      alt="&#39;European languages&#39; by Aswathy N©" title="The Fascinating World Of Indo-European And Other Languages Of Europe 8"                ></p><p> Colmar, France</p><p> If you think about <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learning French <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , don’t forget to consider the long list of <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >French-speaking countries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

But in Europe, it only has approximately 65 million native speakers who reside in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.</p><p> Nowadays, English is the_lingua franca_ of the world.

You may feel like a European language is hard to learn, but classification has to be made by experts. The Foreign Service Institute of the US Government in this case. What recommends them? The FSI has some 800 language learning courses in 70 languages with over 70 years of experience in instructing US diplomats and foreign affairs employees to learn languages.</p><p> According to them,<strong>the hardest European languages to learn are:</strong></p><ul><li>Finnish</li><li>Icelandic</li><li>Hungarian</li><li>Polish</li><li>Croatian</li><li>Turkish</li><li>Greek</li><li>Estonian</li><li>Latvian</li><li>Bulgarian</li><li>Ukrainian</li><li>Russian</li><li>Slovak</li></ul><p> The FSI classifies all these European languages as tier 4 out of 5 – with 5 being the highest difficulty level.

Considering that German is the 12th <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >most spoken language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> worldwide with 135 million speakers (out of which only ~75 million are native), do you still believe the speculation? If German was such a hard language to learn, would 60 million speak German as a second language? It’s important to find out what to really expect if you want to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >study German <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . So let’s find out: is German hard to learn? We’ll give an honest answer.</p><p> Like people, languages are very different but also sometimes similar. This doesn’t mean you can’t be friends. Read on to discover a fair evaluation of the complexity of the German language. If_Deutsch_ is as hard as they say, we will reveal a safe method to make it easy.</p><h2 id="Why-is-German-considered-hard-to-learn"><a href="#Why-is-German-considered-hard-to-learn" class="headerlink" title="Why is German considered hard to learn?"></a>Why is German considered hard to learn?</h2><p> We can all probably agree that German has a bad reputation for being one of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >hardest languages to learn <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Society, entertainment, and memes in particular, always seem to maintain and even solidify our prejudices about the German language. The two most popular justifications are its neverending long words and their harsh pronunciation. Over the course of history, we had and still have a lot of preconceptions, but this one is particularly hard to break. So let’s shatter all the myths right here, right now.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-German-is-impossible-to-pronounce"><a href="#1-German-is-impossible-to-pronounce" class="headerlink" title="1. German is impossible to pronounce"></a>1. German is impossible to pronounce</h3><p> The internet is stuffed with videos of people exaggerating the German pronunciation. So you’ll probably be surprised to find out that German is actually easy to pronounce compared to a lot of other languages. In fact, it is one of the few languages where pronunciation makes sense. Most of the time, each letter sounds the same regardless of its place inside a word. For example, unlike German, English seems to have no rule whatsoever.</p><p> So rest assured, German pronunciation doesn’t really require twisting your tongue like a pretzel.</p><p><strong>Verdict: false assumption.</strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087264/19272" target="_top" id="2087264"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087264"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087264/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-German-words-are-neverending"><a href="#2-German-words-are-neverending" class="headerlink" title="2. German words are neverending"></a>2. German words are neverending</h3><p> Or so they seem. The German language is famous for having some of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >longest words in the world <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . But did you know that these words are, in fact, compounds? This means that German puts different words together to create a new word. In turn, English uses spaces or hyphens to make everything much easier to read. German, unfortunately, spells everything together. For example,<em>rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz</em> (63 letters) means “law delegating beef label monitoring”.</p><p> However, there’s an easy trick to overcome this problem. All you have to do is to mentally separate the awfully long word into smaller bits. The more short <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >German words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you know, the more long German words you’ll master. Easy as that!</p><p><strong>Verdict: true assumption, but not as scary as it seems.</strong></p><h3 id="3-Multiple-genders-AND-formal-vs-informal-language"><a href="#3-Multiple-genders-AND-formal-vs-informal-language" class="headerlink" title="3. Multiple genders AND formal vs. informal language"></a>3. Multiple genders AND formal vs. informal language</h3><p> Everyone who doesn’t speak English as a first language will probably groan at this one. The German language has three genders: feminine, masculine and neuter. But so do almost all the other languages. English just got lucky.</p><p> The same situation is true of formal vs. informal. German uses two forms for ‘you’:</p><ul><li>formal_Sie_ when addressing strangers, coworkers, etc.,</li><li>informal_Du_ when addressing friends and family.</li></ul><p> Then take Spanish, for example, which uses the word_usted_ for informal interactions. If English doesn’t have it, it doesn’t mean it is hard to learn. Wouldn’t you agree?</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <strong>true assumption, but not as scary as it seems.</strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1047974&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-04_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/german-hard-to-learn-960x640.jpg"                      alt="&#39;German hard to learn&#39; by Sebastian Herrmann©" title="Is German Hard To Study? 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                >vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-German-grammar-is-too-hard-to-learn"><a href="#4-German-grammar-is-too-hard-to-learn" class="headerlink" title="4.

Once you will understand the basics, you’ll have no problem going forward with the rest of the curriculum. In addition, due to the shared vocabulary, there are many English and German phrases that follow the same order.

But in truth,<strong>German is actually easier to learn than a lot of other languages.</strong></p><p> The answer truly lies somewhere in between. While it is closely related to English because they both belong to the West Germanic group of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Indo-European language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> family, German is not necessarily easy to learn.

That’s why it’s important to learn the <strong>colors in French</strong> before (almost) anything else.</p><p> We sometimes forget how splendid the world we live in is. Luckily we have Netflix and David Attenborough to remind us that the spectacular is around us and not in our imagination. But what if the world would lose its color? Would the sky have the same calming effect without its blue? Would we still yearn to spend an afternoon in the wonderful sea of green trees lying at the foothills of a mountain? Would we still drool at the sight of colorless food?</p><p> This is exactly why colors are such a vital part of our everyday vocabulary.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296685&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2022/video-pp/ScreenshotSlider/Nero-Video-Advanced-editing.JPG"                      border="0"                >Simple and intuitive video editing<br>🎬 Nero Video:<br>The powerful video editing program for your Windows PC</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-colors-in-French"><a href="#The-colors-in-French" class="headerlink" title="The colors in French"></a>The colors in French</h2><p> There is ‘Pinot Noir’, ‘film noir’, ‘neo-noir’ movies and even ‘noir furniture’. So what is ‘noir’? Well, ‘noir’ is French for ‘black’. Simple as that.</p><p> But once again, French learners are not as lucky as English learners. While in English, color names keep their forms regardless of the noun’s gender, French colors must agree with the gender and number of the noun they are determining.

Home to a plethora of languages, many of which belong to the vast Indo-European language family, Europe boasts a rich linguistic landscape that plays a crucial role in shaping its cultural identity. To understand how multilingualism promotes unity and cooperation on the continent, let’s explore the endlessly fascinating languages of Europe.</p><p> Join us for Europe Day (and beyond) in this fantastic quest through the Indo-European languages. During this linguistic quest, we will make several stops:</p><h2 id="Why-do-we-celebrate-Europe-Day"><a href="#Why-do-we-celebrate-Europe-Day" class="headerlink" title="Why do we celebrate Europe Day?"></a>Why do we celebrate Europe Day?</h2><p> According to the European Union,<strong>Europe Day celebrates peace and unity in Europe.</strong> May 9th marks the anniversary of the historic ‘Schuman Declaration’, an ambitious plan that suggested a new way for European countries to work together, making war between them impossible. Schuman’s proposal is widely regarded as the genesis of the present-day European Union.</p><p> Europe Day also serves as a reminder of the importance of unity, cultural diversity, and the shared values that bind the European community together.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075475/7443" target="_top" id="2075475"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075475"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Historical-context"><a href="#Historical-context" class="headerlink" title="Historical context"></a>Historical context</h3><p> In 1950, European countries were recovering from World War II, which ended five years earlier. To prevent another devastating war, European governments decided to combine their coal and steel production. This would make war between France and Germany practically impossible, and it was believed that joining economic interests would improve living standards and create a more united Europe.</p><p> The Schuman Declaration, presented by French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman on May 9, 1950, proposed the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). The ECSC, with founding members France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Belgium <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and Luxembourg, was the first in a series of European institutions that eventually evolved into today’s European Union.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.macxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4526659&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.macxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/vcp-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="European-language-families-and-branches"><a href="#European-language-families-and-branches" class="headerlink" title="European language families and branches"></a>European language families and branches</h2><p> Europe is home to several major language families, the most prominent being the<strong>Indo-European language family.</strong> Other significant language families include Uralic, Turkic, and Basque, each contributing to the rich linguistic landscape of the continent.</p><p> Comprising over 400 languages spoken by over 45% of the world’s population, it is believed that <strong>Indo-European languages originated from a hypothetical language called Proto-Indo-European,</strong> which is no longer in use.</p><p> It seems that the earliest speakers of Proto-Indo-European originally lived around today’s Ukraine and the nearby regions in the Caucasus and Southern Russia. What allowed the language to spread so far and wide was, interestingly enough, the people’s success in domesticating cattle, dogs, and, above all, horses. This allowed them to distribute the language across Eurasia on their horses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/europe-language-960x558.jpg"                      alt="&#39;Europe languages&#39; by Joseph Daniel©" title="The Fascinating World Of Indo-European And Other Languages Of Europe 6"                ></p><p> Because Proto-Indo-European speakers didn’t create a writing system, we don’t have any written records of their language. Linguists have tried to recreate this ancient language using different methods. Even though a perfect reconstruction may not be possible, we still have a general idea of the language and culture these early speakers shared.</p><p> Today, Indo-European languages are widely spoken in the Americas, Europe and Western and Southern Asia.</p><h3 id="Branches-of-Indo-European-languages"><a href="#Branches-of-Indo-European-languages" class="headerlink" title="Branches of Indo-European languages"></a>Branches of Indo-European languages</h3><p> The Indo-European language family is, in turn, divided into several branches, each consisting of a group of related languages. Here are some of the major Indo-European branches:</p><ol><li><strong>Indo-Iranian:</strong> This is the largest branch of the Indo-European family. It includes two major sub-branches: Indic and Iranian. Indic languages include <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Hindi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Bengali, Punjabi, Urdu, and many others spoken in India and Pakistan. Sanskrit is the most popular among the early languages of this sub-branch. Iranian <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >languages include Persian <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Farsi), Pashto, and Kurdish, primarily spoken in Iran, Afghanistan, and other parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.</li><li><strong>Greek:</strong> The sole member of its branch, Greek is a dialect group rather than a branch of languages. The earliest surviving evidence of a Greek language were Mycenaean writings found in Crete.</li><li><strong>Italic:</strong> Latin is the most well-known language in this branch. Other languages, such as Faliscan, Sabellic, Umbrian, South Picene, and Oscan, were once part of this branch, but they have all become extinct. <strong>Today, the Romance languages are the sole surviving descendants of the Italic branch.</strong></li><li><strong>Celtic:</strong> The same as Indo-Iranian, this branch includes two sub-branches: Continental Celtic and Insular Celtic. Continental Celtic languages were absorbed by Latin, but geographical isolation helped the Insular Celtic sub-branch flourish in the British Isles. As a result, the Celtic languages spoken today are Irish Gaelic, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, Cornish, and Breton.</li><li><strong>Germanic:</strong> The Germanic branch has three sub-branches: East Germanic, which is now extinct; North Germanic, which includes Old Norse, the origin of modern Scandinavian languages; and West Germanic, which has Old English, Old Saxon, and Old High German.</li><li><strong>Balto-Slavic:</strong> This branch consists of two sub-branches: Baltic and Slavic. While only two Baltic languages survive today (Latvian and Lithuanian), the Slavic sub-branch has a plethora of surviving languages spoken mostly in Eastern Europe. Some of these are Russian, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Bulgarian, Serbian,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Croatian <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Bosnian, Slovene, Macedonian, and Ukrainian.</li><li><strong>Anatolian:</strong> Predominant in some areas of Syria and the Asian side of Turkey. The most famous language of this branch is Hittite. However, all the Anatolian languages as currently extinct.</li><li><strong>Armenian:</strong> The Armenian language is the sole member of its branch within the Indo-European language family.</li><li><strong>Albanian:</strong> The official language of Albania and Kosovo, Albanian forms its own distinct branch within the Indo-European language family.
