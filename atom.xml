Its goal was to determine Germany’s best online portals.</p><p> The best providers in 45 categories were honored based on around 33,000 customer opinions that rated a total of 570 online portals.</p><blockquote><p><em>The award answers the question of which portals are the best in Germany. And this decision is not made by a jury, but by the users themselves. The winners are therefore a consumer recommendation – in the best sense of the word</em> , says DISQ.</p></blockquote><p> <strong>In the <a class="link"   href="https://disq.de/2019/20190528-Online-Portale-Preis-Lernportale-Sprachen.html" >Language Learning Portal <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> category, 18 companies were rated by customers and Mondly led the way with an overall result of 76 points.</strong></p><p> The survey focused on the customers’ opinions of the respective language learning portals in the areas of offers, customer service, and websites. The sub-criteria ranged from quality and variety of the service offered, to use and speed of the portal and friendliness and competence of the customer service by telephone, e-mail, or social media.</p><ul><li><a class="link"

Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Especially in Italy where the people are so warm and friendly! Just a simple <a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875"><strong>hello in Italian</strong></a> , like_Ciao_ ,<em>Buongiorno</em> or_Salve,_ can make all the difference in a conversation with an Italian native. Maybe add a_bacio sulla guancia_ (kiss on the cheek) to that if it is appropriate and they will absolutely love you! And don’t think that this is just “an Italian thing”. No. Your attempt to speak the local language will surely be regarded as a sign of respect everywhere you go in the world. So get your greetings on point before traveling to a foreign country. You never get a second chance to make a good first impression!</p><h2 id="1-How-to-say-“hello”-in-Italian"><a href="#1-How-to-say-“hello”-in-Italian" class="headerlink" title="1. How to say “hello” in Italian"></a>1. How to say “hello” in Italian</h2><p><em>Ciao</em> is undeniably the most common Italian greeting. In fact, I’d say it is universal and used in many countries between friends as a joke. Together, of course, with_Capisce_ (“Do you understand?”). We all use_Capisce_ and_Buongiorno_ (“<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Good morning <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> “) when we want to summon our inner Italians, don’t we? Hahaha!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/HPZubh6ApHpN6/giphy.gif"                      alt="italian" title="How To Say Hello In Italian: Top 10 Italian Greetings 2"                ></p><p> But there’s more to<strong>Italian greetings</strong> than just_Ciao_ . Let’s discover the best ways to<strong>say hello in Italian</strong> and how it is appropriate to use them, depending on the social context you are in.</p><h3 id="Hello-in-Italian-–-Salve"><a href="#Hello-in-Italian-–-Salve" class="headerlink" title="Hello in Italian – Salve!"></a><strong>Hello in Italian – Salve!</strong></h3><p> The Italian culture is renowned for its deep respect for the elderly. That is why you should always be a bit more formal in one-to-one interactions with older people or with people you don’t personally know. In this kind of situation, you can safely use_Salve._ To put it into perspective,<em>Ciao</em> is the Italian equivalent of “Hi” while_Salve_ is the equivalent of “Hello”.</p><h3 id="Hi-in-Italian-–-Ciao"><a href="#Hi-in-Italian-–-Ciao" class="headerlink" title="Hi in Italian – Ciao!"></a><strong>Hi in Italian – Ciao!</strong></h3><p> Definitely, your best choice for an informal situation,<em>Ciao,</em> derived from the Venetian phrase_S-ciào vostro_ or_S-ciào su,_ literally meaning “I am your slave”. However, the expression was not to be taken literally. Its real meaning was rather a promise of goodwill among friends (the same “at your service” was used in English).</p><p> The phrase was later shortened to_Ciào_ , lost its servile connotations, and started being used as an informal greeting by all people regardless of their class.</p><p> Moving on to other ways to<strong>say hello in Italian</strong> , if you want to greet a group of friends, you can also say**<em>Ciao a tutti</em>** which means “Hello everybody”. Depending on your relationship with the members of the group you are greeting, you can also say**<em>Salve a tutti</em>** or you can greet each and every one of them differently.</p><p> In Italy, it is also possible to hear children say_Ciao-ciao,_ which is the cuter version of_Ciao_ and it translates to “Bye-bye”.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129738/7443" target="_top" id="2129738">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129738" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129738/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Italian-greetings-for-certain-moments-of-the-day"><a href="#2-Italian-greetings-for-certain-moments-of-the-day" class="headerlink" title="2.

Italian greetings for certain moments of the day</h2><p><strong>Good morning in Italian</strong> –<em>Buongiorno!</em> (it can also be used as a goodbye)<br><strong>Good afternoon in Italian</strong> –<em>Buon pomeriggio!</em><br><strong>Good evening in Italian</strong> –<em>Buonasera!</em> (it can also be used as a goodbye)<br><strong>Good night in Italian</strong> –<em>Buonanotte!</em> (it isn’t used only as a bedtime expression. Italians say_Buonanotte_ when they meet someone in the late evening.)<br> All four of these greetings are safe to use in any kind of formal or informal interaction.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886015/19272" target="_top" id="1886015">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886015" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886015/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-How-to-say-“goodbye-”in-Italian"><a href="#3-How-to-say-“goodbye-”in-Italian" class="headerlink" title="3. How to say “goodbye ”in Italian"></a><strong>3. How to say</strong> “<strong>goodbye</strong> ”<strong>in Italian</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Arrivederci</em></strong> is the most common way to say<strong>“goodbye” in Italian.</strong> The same as_Ciao_ , it can be used safely in all kinds of social contexts (formal or informal).<br> However, you should note that, depending on when you say it,<em>Ciao</em> can also mean “Goodbye”. So yeah, it’s now safe to say that_Ciao_ is an all-purpose greeting.<br> On the other hand, if you want to say goodbye, let’s say, to_la nonna della famiglia_ (the grandmother of the family), you’ll want to be a bit more formal than_Arrivederci_ . In that situation,<em>Arrivederla</em> is recommended.</p><p> Want more? Here are other ways to say goodbye in Italian that are suitable for both formal and informal situations:</p><ul><li>See you later. –<em>A dopo.</em></li><li>See you in a bit. –<em>A fra poco.</em></li><li>See you tomorrow. –<em>A domani.</em></li><li>See you soon. –<em>A presto.</em></li></ul><h2 id="4-Other-basic-Italian-phrases-that-you-should-know"><a href="#4-Other-basic-Italian-phrases-that-you-should-know" class="headerlink" title="4. Other basic Italian phrases that you should know"></a>4. Other basic Italian phrases that you should know</h2><p> If you want to travel to Italy, you should know that this is where you’ll meet one of the kindest, friendliest and most talkative people in Europe. Don’t believe us? Well, hear this! If you are familiar enough, the Italians will even give you an_bacio sulla guancia_ (kiss on the cheek). Careful though! Not every social interaction calls for a cheek kiss. So don’t take the first step yet. In time, you will learn the proper Italian behavior.</p><p> The bottom line is that one week in Italy is enough to fill yourself with positive energy and joy <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875"                      alt="**Learn Italian**"                > , book your trip and see for yourself.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134490/18498" target="_top" id="2134490">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134490" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134490/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Now let us go back to the point.

But what about the hardest? Well, since we already answered your second question in a <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >previous post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , today you are focusing on the<strong>top 10 easiest languages to learn by an English speaker.</strong></p><p> As a general rule, when you are doing a hierarchy or a top of any kind, you should first research and consult the highest authority in the field. When talking about the hardest or the easiest languages to learn, ranked, the <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign%5FService%5FInstitute" >Foreign Service Institute (FSI) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  of the US Government holds the responsibility of having the most pertinent results. As you probably already guessed, the FSI is preparing American diplomats and other professionals to advance U.S. foreign affairs interests overseas. With around 800 language learning courses in 70 languages, the FSI has over 70 years of experience in instructing people to learn languages.</p><p>As <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >the FSI confirms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  , a native English speaker would need about 575 hours or 23 weeks to achieve professional working proficiency (level 3 on the Interagency Language Roundtable scale) in one of the easiest languages to learn.</p><p> Just to put things into perspective, the same native English speaker would need around 2200 hours or 88 weeks to reach the same level of fluency in one of the hardest languages to learn: Arabic, Chinese, Japanese or Korean.</p><p> Read on and discover the top 10 easiest languages to learn for English speakers, languages you could learn in less than six months.

Due to immigration, around 20% of the population of Greenland also speaks Danish as a first language.</p><p> What makes Danish easy to learn by English speakers is the fact that there are around 900 Danish words we already use in English. Plus another 900 other words that linguists can’t yet decide if they were borrowed from Danish or just simply resemble their Danish equivalent.</p><p>Check out t h e <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >6 best Danish films to learn Danish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> !</p><h2 id="Swedish"><a href="#Swedish" class="headerlink" title="Swedish"></a>Swedish</h2><p> Spoken by 10 million people in both Sweden and Finland, the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Swedish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> language is known to be mutually intelligible with Norwegian and Danish (to some extent). Good news, right?</p><p> An important characteristic of Swedish grammar that makes it different from English is the placement of the definite article after the noun. However, its vocabulary contains many loanwords from German, French, and English. That means you’ll have a better chance at mastering it faster if you already know the above-mentioned languages. Everywhere you look in the world of languages, there’s a connection that can help you learn faster. Make the most of it!</p><h2 id="Norwegian"><a href="#Norwegian" class="headerlink" title="Norwegian"></a>Norwegian</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/norwegian-landscape-960x720.jpg"                      alt="norwegian landscape" title="Top 10 Easiest Languages To Learn 2"                ></p><p> “Lofoten Islands, Svolvær, Norway” by John O’Nolan©</p><p> With around 5 million native speakers,<a class="link"   href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Norwegian-language" >Norwegian has an interesting story <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> behind its two distinct norms: Bokmål (also known as Dano-Norwegian or Riksmål) and New Norwegian (also known as Nynorsk).</p><p> The story started back in the 15th century after the union of Norway with Denmark. That’s when Old Norwegian writing traditions gradually began to die out, and Dano-Norwegian took over. Then, in 1814, Norway became independent, and although the linguistic union with Danish persisted, the people felt they needed a language of their own. That’s when the New Norwegian norm began to be used. Today, the people of Norway learn to read and write in New Norwegian, but only about 20% of them use it as their language of choice in writing.</p><h2 id="Afrikaans-–-the-easiest-language-to-learn-for-both-English-and-Dutch-speakers"><a href="#Afrikaans-–-the-easiest-language-to-learn-for-both-English-and-Dutch-speakers" class="headerlink" title="Afrikaans – the easiest language to learn for both English and Dutch speakers"></a>Afrikaans – the easiest language to learn for both English and Dutch speakers</h2><p> Afrikaans, the same as English, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, is a Germanic language. This is what makes it obviously easier to learn by a native English speaker. These languages use the same alphabet as English, have comparable stress and intonation patterns, and sometimes even share some vocabulary words.</p><p> The Afrikaans language is spoken in South Africa, Namibia, and in some regions of Botswana and Zimbabwe. But the most exciting thing you must know <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans" >about Afrikaans <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is that 90 to 95% of its vocabulary is of Dutch origin as a consequence of Dutch settlers establishing in Cape Town in 1652. As a result, the Afrikaans language gradually arose in the Dutch Cape Colony during the course of the 18th century.</p><p> Thus, if you are a language nerd that also wants to become a <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >polyglot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , with Dutch you can kill one and three-quarters of a bird with one stone because you’ll also understand a big part of the Afrikaans language. If simplicity isn’t enough for you, here are <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >7 more reasons to learn Afrikaans! <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Dutch"><a href="#Dutch" class="headerlink" title="Dutch"></a>Dutch</h2><p> As we already mentioned, Dutch can be considered Afrikaans’ oldest sibling since they share almost the same vocabulary (90-95%). With around 24 million speakers, Dutch is the third most widely spoken Germanic language – the first two being English and German – and the official language of the Netherlands and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Belgium <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (together with French and German).</p><p> Careful though! The spoken language of Dutch is tricky as it has many dialects. While Standard Dutch is used for official purposes, its dialects are used in a great variety of informal situations. Sometimes you’ll find villages that use a Dutch dialect of their own.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934254/19272" target="_top" id="1934254">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934254" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934254/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Romance-languages-are-almost-just-as-easy-to-learn"><a href="#The-Romance-languages-are-almost-just-as-easy-to-learn" class="headerlink" title="The Romance languages are almost just as easy to learn"></a>The Romance languages are almost just as easy to learn</h2><p> For a native (or not) English speaker such as yourself, French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish are practically just as easy to learn for you as the Germanic languages. To achieve a professional working proficiency level in any of these languages, you’ll need about 600 hours or 24 weeks of study. That’s only an extra week!

I love my job and I always research the best tools and strategies available to catch my students’ attention – even though that may sometimes mean to resort to technology. And I say “resort to” because I know some of us condemn the use of modern tech like apps in the classroom (I’ll get back to that later). But as I found out in my 4 years as a teacher, not all technology is bad. After doing some extensive research I discovered some of<strong>the best apps for teachers</strong> and I want to share them all with you.</p><p> Back to what I said about “resorting to” apps or other types of tech in the classroom – yes, technology might not always be our best friend. Black Mirror, Netflix’s star show, emphasizes superbly that aspect, but whether we like it or not, technology is incredibly smart! It can help teachers everywhere teach better, smarter and faster. It doesn’t have to replace us, but it can support our work with<strong>clever educational apps for teachers</strong> that are willing to adapt and improve their teaching style – teachers like you or me.</p><p> Since we are here, I figured it would be best to classify my recommendations into two major categories –<strong>best apps for teaching</strong> and<strong>best apps for learning</strong> – and then take it from there.</p><h2 id="Best-apps-for-teaching"><a href="#Best-apps-for-teaching" class="headerlink" title="Best apps for teaching"></a>Best apps for teaching</h2><p> If you want to upgrade your teaching style in order to get closer to your elementary or secondary school students and win their interest and attention, I absolutely recommend researching some<strong>school apps for teachers.</strong> It won’t only help you; it will also make you look cooler in your students’ eyes. You know how teenagers’ minds work.</p><p> But don’t overdo it. If surrender yourself with software for teachers and countless tech solutions, it might be too much in the end. I used to work a full-time job at a multinational company before becoming a teacher and the managers insisted on working with one-page reports, project management apps, smaller Excel reports and daily reports on Slack. Honestly, I got lost. It was too much. That is why you have to focus on the basics. You don’t want “fancy”. You want “useful”. So here they are:<strong>the best educational apps for teachers.</strong></p><h2 id="1-mondlyWORKS"><a href="#1-mondlyWORKS" class="headerlink" title="**1. mondlyWORKS"></a>**1. mondlyWORKS</h2><p> I will recommend <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the “best apps for learning” category too, but its integrative B2B platform also makes it one of<strong>the best educational apps for teachers</strong> –<strong>foreign language teachers</strong> especially.</p><p> Its principle is simple: the same way we share apps to watch movies we can now share Mondly to learn languages. As a teacher, we get access to a dedicated dashboard where you can manage, invite new users, see their statistics and track their progress.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/apps-for-foreign-language-teachers-1024x317.png"                      alt="apps for foreign language teachers" title="The 5 Best Apps For Language Teachers 2"                ></p><p> mondlyWORKS in a nutshell</p><p> The platform includes all the language learning experiences Mondly has created so far: the main app, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyKbKqeOX78" >Augmented Reality module <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1272636489423125/?locale=en_US" >Mondly VR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – the virtual reality app for learning languages and <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.kids.languages&hl=en" >Mondly Kids <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – the language learning app for kids and toddlers. So depending on your target – elementary school, junior high or senior high – <strong>Mondly offers a dedicated <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >language learning solution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for every age segment.</strong></p><p> Additionally, you can also share mondlyWORKS with your family or work colleagues.</p><h2 id="2-Slack"><a href="#2-Slack" class="headerlink" title="**2. Slack"></a>**2. Slack</h2><p> You definitely need to communicate with both the students and their parents and Facebook is not the right place for it. Lately, I noticed that more and more teachers use Facebook groups for communication, but Slack is much more appropriate given the fact that Facebook is a place where personal stories and photos get shared.</p><p> Besides, if you are not a high school teacher, you’ll probably need a different communication channel since teens are allowed on Facebook only after the age of 13.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/teacher-parent-communication-app-1024x690.png"                      alt="teacher parent communication app" title="The 5 Best Apps For Language Teachers 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136612/26400" target="_top" id="2136612">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136612" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136612/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Screenshot of Slack</p><p> With Slack, you can create different “workspaces” for every group of students and their parents, communicate with the whole group at once or individually, give feedback, share reminders and homework to make sure everyone is up to date or use integrations such as Google+ Hangouts, Google Docs, and Google Calendar to share documents or set video call meetings with the parents. Very complex and helpful, but at the same easy to use – I can assure you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134249/18498" target="_top" id="2134249">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134249" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134249/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-TrackCC"><a href="#3-TrackCC" class="headerlink" title="3.

The first two are not necessarily dedicated apps for teachers, but rather general apps that teachers successfully use in their activity. And that was completely intentional. I believe that we sometimes like to overcomplicate things, but why use a dedicated app for parent-teacher communication when you can use Slack – an easy app that most parents already have access to?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/attendance-app-for-teachers.png"                      alt="attendance app for teachers" title="The 5 Best Apps For Language Teachers 4"                ></p><p> TrackCC in a nutshell</p><p> Back to TrackCC – this is still not the perfect<strong>grading and attendance app</strong> I was looking for because of its somehow dull design, but the fact that it works is more important right now. While doing the initial research I found some grading apps for teachers that did not include the “attendance” feature and vice-versa. So TrackCC is really good because it includes both, it is intuitive and allows you, as a teacher, to keep track of grades and attendance and share them all in real time with both student and parents.</p><h2 id="4-Youtube"><a href="#4-Youtube" class="headerlink" title="**4. Youtube"></a>**4. Youtube</h2><p> You probably didn’t expect this one, but <strong>Youtube can actually be of the best educational tools for teachers</strong> if you know how to make the most of it.</p><p> If you’ll do some research on your area of interest, you’ll soon discover a lot of great content to share with your students. Ask them to watch the videos at home – or during class if they are shorter – and then discuss the topic, ask questions, give feedback and keep them involved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/educational-apps-for-teachers-1024x524.png"                      alt="educational apps for teachers" title="The 5 Best Apps For Language Teachers 5"                ></p><p> Screenshot of Youtube</p><p> Just test this theory on the Youtube educational channel <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q" >“Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  and see how your students react to your new learning strategy.</p><h2 id="5-Google-Earth"><a href="#5-Google-Earth" class="headerlink" title="**5. Google Earth"></a>**5. Google Earth</h2><p> I don’t know about your school, but there are countless educational institutions around the world that still use the good, ol’ paper map. That’s not necessarily bad, but Google Earth is a free service that looks absolutely amazing. And this is not just about the students. If I’d be a Geography teacher I’d love to use Google Earth. Is one thing to identify Mount Everest on a paper map and another to see it in the Google Earth app. Just look at this:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/school-apps-for-teachers-960x529.png"                      alt="school apps for teachers" title="The 5 Best Apps For Language Teachers 6"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144284/7443" target="_top" id="2144284">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144284" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144284/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Screenshot of Google Earth</p><p> And that is not applicable only for Geography, but also for Biology or Physics.

From the rhythmic beats that make our feet tap to the soulful melodies that stir our hearts, this universal language has an undeniable power over humanity. It moves us – physically, emotionally and psychologically as it increases blood flow to areas of the brain that generate and control emotions. It can uplift us, calm us, and even help us focus. But can you learn a language through music? Do music and language really go hand in hand?</p><p> Probably the most interesting theory on how music helps our brain is the Mozart effect. This theory suggests that the music of Mozart “makes you smarter”. There are probably hundreds of Youtube playlists with Mozart’s music for “brain power”. However, it seems that the results of the original study were highly exaggerated. Nonetheless, as I write these lines, I listen to classical music and I can confirm it helps me concentrate.</p><p> As we delve into this fascinating exploration, let’s hit ‘play’ on our favorite tune and find out whether learning a language through music actually works.</p><h2 id="Music-and-language-go-together-like-Beyonce-and-Jay-Z"><a href="#Music-and-language-go-together-like-Beyonce-and-Jay-Z" class="headerlink" title="Music and language go together like Beyoncé and Jay-Z"></a>Music and language go together like Beyoncé and Jay-Z</h2><p> Whether you’re tuning into music to concentrate better while learning a new language (with <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-8155&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-8155&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-8155" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), or you’re enjoying songs in the language you’re trying to learn, keep it up! It will only accelerate the process.</p><p> Movies, books and music are all fun ways to improve your understanding of a new language. However, if you’re just starting, music is your best choice as it doesn’t feel as overwhelming as reading a book, for example. You just go with the flow.</p><p>Music and language go together like Beyoncé and Jay-Z for many reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Better pronunciation and accent:</strong> Songs in a foreign language can significantly improve your pronunciation because they introduce you to the native rhythm, speed, and intonation of the language. As you sing along or simply listen, you mimic the pronunciation, making your spoken language sound more natural.</li><li><strong>Enhanced memory:</strong> It’s always easier to remember new phrases and words if you put them on some catchy music. The songs act as a mnemonic device, making the words easier to recall. What’s a mnemonic device? Just that: a memory technique that can help increase your ability to recall and retain information.</li><li><strong>Improved vocabulary:</strong> Songs are filled with everyday vocabulary, idioms, and expressions. By listening to music, you’re exposed to the most commonly used words in context, which helps you understand what they mean and how to use them.</li><li><strong>Better understanding of grammar and structure:</strong> Through song lyrics, you can get exposed to many different grammar structures. This way, you can get a feel for how sentences are constructed in a particular language.</li><li><strong>Increased cultural understanding:</strong> By listening to the right music, you can get valuable insights into a country’s culture, history and values.</li></ul><h2 id="Scientifically-proven-learning-a-language-through-music-works"><a href="#Scientifically-proven-learning-a-language-through-music-works" class="headerlink" title="Scientifically proven: learning a language through music works"></a>Scientifically proven: learning a language through music works</h2><p> Okay, learning a language through music works, but is it scientifically proven? The answer is yes. Over the years, there have been multiple studies regarding music’s positive impact on language acquisition. Needless to say, all of them had encouraging results for all those wanting to ease the process of learning a new language.</p><p> In a compelling <a class="link"   href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307917016%5FLanguage%5FLearning%5FEnhanced%5Fby%5FMusic%5Fand%5FSong" >study <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> carried out at Nelson Mandela University in South Africa, the strategic use of song and music was found to boost the motivation of English language learners significantly. The study participants, most of whom had only a rudimentary understanding of English, remarkably demonstrated their ability to dissect contemporary music lyrics as if they were poetry, all thanks to the engaging medium of music.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/listening-to-music-in-spanish-960x640.jpg"                      alt="&#39;Listening to music in Spanish&#39; by Nicholas Githiri©" title="The Power Of Music When Learning A New Language – Sing That Language! 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123739/7443" target="_top" id="2123739">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123739" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123739/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Another <a class="link"   href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249966411%5FSinging%5Fcan%5Ffacilitate%5Fforeign%5Flanguage%5Flearning" >study <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> published in the journal Memory &amp; Cognition demonstrates that melodies can help in learning and recalling new phrases in a foreign language. This is because music and language share neural pathways in the brain, particularly in areas responsible for auditory processing and memory. The process of attaching words to a rhythmic pattern or melody helps reinforce memory retention of those words.</p><p> Furthermore, a <a class="link"   href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6162612/" >study <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the journal Brain Sciences showed that exposure to music at a young age can improve linguistic abilities, emphasizing the connection between music and language development. The rhythm and pitch variations in music mirror the modulation and stress patterns in language, helping learners understand and mimic these patterns.</p><p> The list of studies can continue – all showing the same promising results. As you can see, there’s a firm scientific basis for the notion that learning a language through music can be beneficial.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/themes/mondly/img/mondly-banner-icon.png"                      alt="mondly banner icon" title="The Power Of Music When Learning A New Language – Sing That Language! 3"                ></p><h5 id="Language-learning-made-easy"><a href="#Language-learning-made-easy" class="headerlink" title="Language learning made easy"></a>Language learning made easy</h5><p> Build practical language skills for real life with Mondly.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-8155&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-8155&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-8155&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-8155&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-8155&mt=8" >Start Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1495277">                    <video width="1536" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1495277">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:960px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ffunwhole.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1495277%2F17189'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1495277/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Music-for-language-learning-good-study-songs-and-more"><a href="#Music-for-language-learning-good-study-songs-and-more" class="headerlink" title="Music for language learning: good study songs and more"></a>Music for language learning: good study songs and more</h2><p> If you’re ready to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Italian, French or any other language using music, you need some tips before you get started. Listening to music in Spanish is one search away, but there are o couple of things you should remember.</p><p> Probably the most important aspect of learning a language through music is the songs you choose. Here are the types of songs that are most suitable for learning new words and phrases in a new language:</p><ul><li><strong>Simple and repetitive songs:</strong> Ideal for language learners, songs with simple and recurring lyrics can reinforce basic vocabulary and grammar.</li><li><strong>Children’s songs:</strong> Given their simplicity and clarity, children’s songs are great for language learners who are just starting out.</li><li><strong>Pop songs:</strong> Pop songs are a perfect choice for language learners, as they are fun and have very catchy and have easy-to-remember lyrics.</li><li><strong>Folk songs:</strong> Folk songs, rich with storytelling and cultural references, can deepen learners’ understanding of the language and its culture.</li><li><strong>Songs with clear pronunciation:</strong> Songs with distinct and clear pronunciation can aid learners aiming to improve their own pronunciation and accent.</li><li><strong>Songs with translated lyrics:</strong> For those keen to grasp the meaning of the lyrics and learn new words and phrases, songs with translated lyrics can be beneficial.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/music-language-960x640.jpg"                      alt="&#39;Music language&#39; by Jamakassi©" title="The Power Of Music When Learning A New Language – Sing That Language! 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959712/19272" target="_top" id="1959712">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959712" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959712/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Learning-a-new-language-with-songs-tips-and-tricks"><a href="#Learning-a-new-language-with-songs-tips-and-tricks" class="headerlink" title="Learning a new language with songs: tips and tricks"></a>Learning a new language with songs: tips and tricks</h2><p> Once you have chosen your favorite songs in the language you’re trying to learn, the idea is to have fun and listen carefully. We’re all vibin’ to<strong>Shakira’s new revenge Spanish song</strong> for Pique, but do we understand what she’s saying? If you’re listening to music in Spanish in an effort to learn the language, make sure you’re doing it right. Here are a few tips and tricks you should keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Select suitable songs:</strong> Choose songs that match your language level. If you’re a beginner, choose songs with simple vocabulary and clear pronunciation. Advanced learners can pick songs with more intricate language and quicker lyrics.</li><li><strong>Tune in to the song:</strong> Listen to the song a few times without trying to understand every word. Concentrate on the melody, rhythm, and mood of the song – enjoy it. Notice any recurring phrases or sequences.</li><li><strong>Search for the lyrics:</strong> Find the lyrics of the song in the original language and in your native language. Read through the lyrics and try to understand the meaning of each phrase.</li><li><strong>Learn the vocabulary:</strong> Use a dictionary to clarify any unknown words and compile a list of new vocabulary. Practice saying the words out loud and try to memorize their meanings.</li><li><strong>Sing along:</strong> While listening to the song again, attempt to sing along. Pay attention to your pronunciation and try to match the rhythm and intonation of the singer.</li><li><strong>Practice pronunciation:</strong> If you’re brave enough (some of us aren’t), record yourself singing the song and listen to it. Identify any areas where you need to improve your pronunciation and practice only those sections.</li><li><strong>Analyze the grammar:</strong> Look for examples of grammar structures in the song, such as verb tenses, prepositions, and conjunctions. Try to identify their contextual use.</li><li><strong>Use the song to practice speaking:</strong> Use the song lyrics as conversation starters with a language partner or tutor. You can also use the song as a prompt for writing exercises, such as writing a short story or describing a scene.</li></ul><p> Once you’ve discovered a band or artist that you like, try to learn as much as possible about them. Aim to understand their origins and their inspirations, as this can enrich your comprehension of the cultural backdrop of their music.</p><p> The bottom line is this: learning a language through music is possible. Especially if you’re only starting to learn the language and<strong>can’t live without Spotify</strong> . All you have to do is enjoy the process and learn what you can from it. Now let’s recap a few things.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l2QDLujtcAvAr2gRa/giphy.gif"                      alt="music language" title="The Power Of Music When Learning A New Language – Sing That Language! 5"                ></p><h3 id="How-to-learn-a-language-by-listening-to-music"><a href="#How-to-learn-a-language-by-listening-to-music" class="headerlink" title="How to learn a language by listening to music?"></a>How to learn a language by listening to music?</h3><p> One way to learn a language through music is to listen to songs in the target language and try to follow along with the lyrics.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Macau-A-Study-in-Linguistic-Convergence"><a href="#Macau-A-Study-in-Linguistic-Convergence" class="headerlink" title="Macau: A Study in Linguistic Convergence"></a>Macau: A Study in Linguistic Convergence</h2><p> <strong>Macau’s language tapestry is a fascinating blend of Cantonese, Portuguese, and Macanese</strong> —a Portuguese-based creole. This intriguing linguistic composition serves as a testament to the region’s rich historical background and cultural amalgamation. Once a Portuguese colony, the city of Macau is now officially known as the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China. As a result, the Macau language, with its harmonious combination of these languages, plays a vital role in shaping this city’s unique cultural personality.</p><p> Nestled in the western Pearl River Delta by the South China Sea, Macau is a vibrant city home to approximately 680,000 inhabitants within a compact area of only 32.9 km2. So it’s no surprise that it is one of<strong>the most densely populated regions in the world.</strong> Though, the most fascinating thing about Macau remains its special blend of Eastern and Western cultures that offer a unique cultural identity that cannot be found anywhere else on the planet.</p><p> Ready to find our more about the rich linguistic mosaic of Macau? Read on to discover the intriguing history behind this captivating blend of languages.</p><h2 id="The-History-of-Macau"><a href="#The-History-of-Macau" class="headerlink" title="The History of Macau"></a>The History of Macau</h2><p> The current linguistic mosaic of Macau began taking shape almost 500 years ago. It all started in 1557, when<strong>the Ming dynasty leased Macau to Portugal</strong> as a trading post. Naturally, this marked the beginning of a significant Portuguese presence in Macau, introducing the Portuguese language and culture to the region.</p><p> The subsequent union of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Portuguese and Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> crowns from 1580 to 1640 further solidified Macau’s prominence as a major trading hub between Europe and the Far East. However, the establishment of a British trading post in nearby Hong Kong in 1750 brought about increased British influence, leading to disputes and a decline in Macau’s prominence as a trading center.</p><p> Portugal continued to administer Macau until 1999, when sovereignty was transferred back to China.</p><p> Today, Macau is a thriving gambling destination – often referred to as the “Las Vegas of the East” – with a degree of autonomy from Beijing and a gambling industry seven times larger than that of Las Vegas. The city is renowned for its high per capita incomes, ranking among the highest globally, and its impressive Human Development Index, which places it fourth worldwide in terms of life expectancy.</p><p> Furthermore, approximately two-thirds of the city’s land area consists of reclaimed land from the sea, making the territory highly urbanized.</p><p> Despite its tumultuous history, Macau is the perfect example of a happy ending.</p><h2 id="Multilingualism-in-Macau"><a href="#Multilingualism-in-Macau" class="headerlink" title="Multilingualism in Macau"></a>Multilingualism in Macau</h2><p> Now that you know the history behind it, the Macau linguistic heritage makes much more sense.</p><p><strong>The official languages of Macau are Chinese and Portuguese.</strong> Given Macau’s history as a Portuguese colony, you’d think many people in Macau speak Portuguese. However, in reality, things are different and Portuguese is spoken by only 2.3% of the people.</p><p><strong>The most widely spoken language in Macau is Cantonese,</strong> which is used in everyday life by over 85% of the population. It is the de facto Chinese dialect in Macau, with strong cultural assimilation and usage in personal interactions.</p><p> <strong>Other languages spoken in Macau include Mandarin, Macanese Portuguese, English and other Chinese variants.</strong> English is usually spoken by those who are engaged in trade, commerce and tourism, while Mandarin is taught and used for official purposes and business dealings with mainland China.</p><p> Interestingly enough, English and Mandarin speakers are more prevalent in Macau compared to Portuguese speakers. While Portuguese is the official of Macau, the British and Chinese cultures exercise a much greater influence on a global scale.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cantonese.jpg"                      alt="Cantonese in Macau" title="Exploring Macau’s Linguistic Mosaic: Cantonese, Macanese, And Portuguese Languages 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151860/7443" target="_top" id="2151860">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151860" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151860/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Macanese-A-Distinctive-Creole-Language-of-Macau"><a href="#Macanese-A-Distinctive-Creole-Language-of-Macau" class="headerlink" title="Macanese: A Distinctive Creole Language of Macau"></a>Macanese: A Distinctive Creole Language of Macau</h2><p><strong>Macanese Patois or the Macanese creole language, known as Patuá</strong> to its speakers, is a mixture of Cantonese, Malay, Sinhalese, and – most importantly – Portuguese. Developed as a lingua franca for communication among the multicultural community of traders, sailors, and settlers, Macanse emerged as a unique language reflecting the melting pot of cultures that Macau represented.</p><p> Known as the<strong>“sunset creole of Macau”</strong> , Macanese is mostly spoken by those of mixed heritage but is fading out among the younger generation. As a matter of fact, UNESCO’s <a class="link"   href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000187026" >Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> even classifies Patuá as a “critically endangered” language.</p><p> The development of Macau’s signature language initially occurred primarily among the descendants of Portuguese settlers in Macau. Instead of marrying locals from neighboring China, they often married women from Portuguese Malacca, Portuguese India, and Portuguese Ceylon. This led to the language adopting notable influences from Malay and Sinhala. In the 17th century, Macanese underwent a further transformation when immigrants from other Portuguese colonies in Asia arrived.</p><p> Even during the time when Macau was Portuguese territory, the usage of Macanese was already declining, and this trend is unlikely to change now that the territory is under Chinese administration. However, speakers of Macanese still hold a deep sense of pride in the fact that Macau has its unique local language.</p><h2 id="Portuguese-in-Macau-A-Journey-of-11-000-km"><a href="#Portuguese-in-Macau-A-Journey-of-11-000-km" class="headerlink" title="Portuguese in Macau: A Journey of 11,000 km"></a>Portuguese in Macau: A Journey of 11,000 km</h2><p> The story of how Portuguese came to Macau and established its presence is truly captivating. While the number of Portuguese speakers in Macau may be small today, the Portuguese influence remains evident in various aspects of Macau’s culture. This influence is particularly noticeable in the legal and administrative sectors, as well as in place names, cuisine, and other cultural elements.</p><p> Additionally, Macau boasts a vibrant Portuguese media presence, which encompasses three daily newspapers, one radio station, and a television channel.</p><p> The linguistic connection between Macau and Portugal also results in significant movement between the two regions. According to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.dsec.gov.mo/Censos2021/en-US/" >2021 Macau Census <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , individuals born in Portugal make up around 0.3% of Macau’s total population, indicating a notable presence of Portuguese-born residents in Macau.</p><h3 id="Official-Portuguese-Usage-in-Macau"><a href="#Official-Portuguese-Usage-in-Macau" class="headerlink" title="Official Portuguese Usage in Macau"></a>Official Portuguese Usage in Macau</h3><p> Despite the relatively small number of Portuguese speakers in Macau, the local government remains committed to promoting the Portuguese language. In public schools, students are taught Chinese, English, and Portuguese, reflecting the importance of these languages in the education system. Additionally, the government offers free programs to facilitate the learning of Portuguese among the general population.</p><p> In official government documents, both written Portuguese and written Chinese (traditional) are used. This dual-language approach demonstrates the recognition and value given to both languages in administrative matters. In daily life, it is common to come across signs and displays in Macau that feature written Chinese and written Portuguese. This parallel use of languages is similar to the coexistence of written Chinese and British English in Hong Kong.</p><h2 id="Cantonese-The-Dominant-Language-of-Macau"><a href="#Cantonese-The-Dominant-Language-of-Macau" class="headerlink" title="Cantonese: The Dominant Language of Macau"></a>Cantonese: The Dominant Language of Macau</h2><p> Cantonese, a variant of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Chinese language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , is spoken in Macau, Hong Kong, Southern China, as well as by Chinese communities in North America and Southeast Asian countries. While Cantonese is considered a dialect of Chinese, it is important to note that Mandarin and Cantonese are not mutually intelligible, meaning speakers of one may not understand the other.</p><p> <strong>Despite the city’s historical ties with Portugal, Cantonese firmly dominates the social, commercial, and educational landscapes of Macau.</strong> Over 85% of people in Macau speak Cantonese.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/multilingualism-in-macau.jpg"                      alt="multilingualism in Macau" title="Exploring Macau’s Linguistic Mosaic: Cantonese, Macanese, And Portuguese Languages 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137220/26400" target="_top" id="2137220">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137220" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137220/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Cantonese serves as the primary medium of instruction in the majority of schools in Macau.

Their survival in Macau depends on preservation efforts and demographic shifts.</p><p> In May 2012, the Public Administration and Civil Service Bureau of the Macau Special Administrative Region issued a circular emphasizing the equal importance of Chinese and Portuguese as the official languages of Macau. They urged public administrations to use both languages when releasing information to the public and requested that any existing information available in only one language be supplemented in the other language. Therefore, Portuguese in Macau seems to be safe for now as it is protected by law.</p><p> As China’s influence continues to grow, there has also been a rise in the use of Mandarin. Still, Cantonese remains dominant. On the other hand, Macanese (Patuá), with its small number of speakers, is in danger of extinction. In order to safeguard this distinctive aspect of Macau’s cultural heritage, concerted efforts are said to be made to preserve and promote Macanese through various cultural events and initiatives.</p><h3 id="Is-English-widely-spoken-in-Macau"><a href="#Is-English-widely-spoken-in-Macau" class="headerlink" title="Is English widely spoken in Macau?"></a>Is English widely spoken in Macau?</h3><p> English is not as widely spoken in Macau compared to Cantonese. However, due to Macau’s status as popular gambling destination, English is commonly understood and spoken. Many signs, menus, and information for tourists are also available in English. Additionally, English is taught as a compulsory subject in schools, contributing to a level of English proficiency among the younger generation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135352/19272" target="_top" id="2135352">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135352" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135352/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Are-there-any-efforts-to-revitalize-endangered-languages-in-Macau"><a href="#Are-there-any-efforts-to-revitalize-endangered-languages-in-Macau" class="headerlink" title="Are there any efforts to revitalize endangered languages in Macau?"></a>Are there any efforts to revitalize endangered languages in Macau?</h3><p> There are Macanese individuals who are actively engaged in revitalizing the language through various creative mediums such as literature, theater, and music. However, the success of language revival ultimately relies on the active participation of younger generations—the ones who will be responsible for carrying it forward into the mid-twenty-first century. Their involvement and commitment are crucial for the preservation and continued vitality of the Macanese language.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/macau-language/&t=Exploring+Macau%E2%80%99s+Linguistic+Mosaic:+Cantonese,+Macanese,+and+Portuguese+Languages"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h4 id="From-0-to-conversational-in-Portuguese-and-Chinese"><a href="#From-0-to-conversational-in-Portuguese-and-Chinese" class="headerlink" title="From 0 to conversational in Portuguese and Chinese"></a>From 0 to conversational in Portuguese and Chinese</h4><p> Planning a trip to Macau?

And that’s only natural. <strong>Humanity’s most foundational knowledge was first articulated in the ancient Greek language.</strong> Whether we’re talking about Plato’s dialogues, Homer’s_Iliad_ , or the forward-looking explorations in science, astronomy, and mathematics, we owe a lot to ancient Greece and its language.</p><p> So, let’s embark on a journey through time and explore the history of the ancient Greek language. We will look at its profound impact on modern languages and culture and how it differs from modern Greek. With a little help from the Greek gods and goddesses, you’ll see that ancient Greek is not a relic of the past but a living legacy echoing everywhere in the modern world.</p><p> Men think about the Roman Empire a lot, but I believe ancient Greece is just as fascinating. What do you think?</p><h2 id="Ancient-Greek-Language-–-Historical-Journey"><a href="#Ancient-Greek-Language-–-Historical-Journey" class="headerlink" title="Ancient Greek Language – Historical Journey"></a>Ancient Greek Language – Historical Journey</h2><p> Stretching over millennia, <strong>the historical journey of the ancient Greek language can be considered as epic as Homer’s_Odyssey_ .</strong> Spoken by some of the most influential people in human history, ancient Greek has known the world in a way we never will.</p><p> But before going over its tale, a clarification needs to be made. When we say “ancient Greek”, most think of the language spoken before our era. However, what we call “ancient Greek” is actually just a phase in the evolution of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Greek-language" >Greek language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The periods in which the Greek language was divided are:</p><ul><li><strong>Proto-Greek:</strong> This is the earliest form of Greek that was not directly attested but inferred.</li><li><strong>Mycenaean Greek:</strong> Dating from the 16th to 12th centuries BC, it’s the most ancient attested form of Greek.</li><li><strong>Ancient Greek:</strong> Used during the “Dark Ages” and Classical periods (1200-300 BC), this version of Greek was spoken widely across regions and was used in literature and philosophy.</li><li><strong>Hellenistic Greek (Koine):</strong> A common dialect that evolved following Alexander the Great’s conquests. It was the lingua franca across the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East and the language of the Christian New Testament.</li><li><strong>Medieval Greek:</strong> Spanned from the 5th to 6th centuries to the 15th century, representing the language of the Byzantine Empire.</li><li><strong>Modern Greek:</strong> This is the contemporary version of Greek, influenced by historical events like the Ottoman rule and the establishment of the modern Greek state. The language underwent purification, removing foreign influences, and there were debates over its official form.</li></ul><p> <strong>The Greek language has one of the longest written records of any language,</strong> first appearing in a syllabic script on clay tablets from the 14th-13th centuries BCE and resurfacing after a four-century gap in the Greek alphabet. It belongs to the<strong>Indo-European family of languages,</strong> which includes Sanskrit, Latin, and Germanic languages, tracing back to a common ancestor, Proto-Indo-European.</p><p> Spanning an oral tradition of 4,000 years and a written tradition of 3,500 years, Greek boasts the lengthiest lineage among Indo-European languages, making it one of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >oldest languages in the world <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Despite the abandonment of the standardized Mycenaean language, local vernacular dialects persisted and evolved into various Greek dialects over time.</p><p> These dialects were significantly influenced by social interactions, economic activities, tribal mixings, and conflicts, leading to a collective linguistic and cultural consciousness among the Greek people. Ancient Greek dialects heavily influenced the era’s literature, with each piece closely tied to a specific dialect that reflected the Greek tribe and its unique socio-economic contexts.</p><p> Ancient Greek writing during this archaic period featured the “Boustrophedon” style (literally “ox-turning”, after the manner of an ox plowing a field), where alternate lines of text were reversed, a technique observed in earlier civilizations. Nevertheless, around the 8th century BC, the Greek alphabet was standardized.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037359/7443" target="_top" id="2037359">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037359" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037359/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Dialects-of-Ancient-Greece"><a href="#Dialects-of-Ancient-Greece" class="headerlink" title="Dialects of Ancient Greece"></a>Dialects of Ancient Greece</h3><p> <strong>Before the conquest by the Macedonians in the late 4th century BCE, there was no unified Greek language;</strong> rather, various competing dialects existed. Each city or region had its standard for inscriptions, and though these dialects were diverse, the Greeks had a concept of a shared linguistic identity and could understand other dialects.</p><p> These dialects, including Attic and Ionic, Aeolic, Arcadocypriot, and Doric, with sub-dialects like Macedonian Greek, resulted from the Greek tribes’ geographic dispersion, varied settlement locations, and political autonomy.</p><p> Naturally, this complex linguistic landscape, characterized by many dialects and writing styles, highlights nothing more than the rich diversity and evolution of the ancient Greek language.</p><h3 id="Iconic-texts-written-in-the-ancient-Greek-language"><a href="#Iconic-texts-written-in-the-ancient-Greek-language" class="headerlink" title="Iconic texts written in the ancient Greek language"></a>Iconic texts written in the ancient Greek language</h3><p> <strong>The most important pieces of writing we have from this period are the Homeric Poems:<em>The Iliad</em> and_The Odyssey_ .</strong> The two epic poems are foundational to Greek education and culture and remain pivotal works in European literary tradition.<em>The Iliad</em> narrates the rage of Achilles during the Trojan War, while_The Odyssey_ follows Odysseus’s journey home after the war. Over time, the composition methods of these epics have been a subject of extensive debate between experts.</p><p>Other literary works of art representative of this period include:</p><ul><li><strong>Plato’s Dialogues</strong></li><li><strong>Sappho’s poems</strong></li><li><strong>Herodotus’ Histories</strong></li><li><strong>Euripides’ tragedies</strong></li><li><strong>Aesop’s fables</strong></li><li><strong>Sophocles’ tragedies</strong></li></ul><p> Many of these names seem familiar because their works were so forward-looking they are still relevant today.

Used for approximately 2,800 years to this day, it is the earliest known alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels and consonants. Greeks adopted and adapted it from the earlier Phoenician alphabet.</p><p> However, the earliest attested form of the Greek language is a clay tablet written in the Linear B script. Historians claim that it dates to between 1450 and 1350 BC. Unrelated to the Greek alphabet, which emerged around the 8th century BC, Linear B last appeared in the 13th century BC. The centuries between the two writing scripts, where no Greek writings have been found, is referred to as the Greek Dark Ages.</p><h2 id="Cultural-Influences-of-Ancient-Greek-on-the-Western-Civilization"><a href="#Cultural-Influences-of-Ancient-Greek-on-the-Western-Civilization" class="headerlink" title="Cultural Influences of Ancient Greek on the Western Civilization"></a>Cultural Influences of Ancient Greek on the Western Civilization</h2><p> Ancient Greece’s influence on Western civilization is undeniable, and you’ll soon see why. For example, where do you think the Olympic Games came from? Or where did democracy originate? They’re both products of Ancient Greece, of course!</p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Greece/The-Olympic-Games" >The Ancient Olympic Games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> were held at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece,</strong> every four years. Unsurprisingly, the origins of the Ancient Olympics are rooted in myth and legend, notably involving Hercules and Zeus. It’s believed Hercules (or Heracles) named the Games ‘Olympic’ and introduced the tradition of hosting them every four years. After finishing his twelve labors, Hercules supposedly built the Olympic Stadium to honor Zeus. He then marked a distance called “stadion” after walking 200 steps, which became a unit of measurement.</p><p> We can’t know how much of this is true. But one thing we know for sure: <strong>inscriptions at Olympia place the inception of the Ancient Olympics in 776 BC.</strong> Apparently, they reached their peak somewhere between the 6th and 5th centuries BCE and then slowly declined in significance as the Romans gained influence in Greece.</p><p> From politics and governance to philosophy and science, Greek terminologies and ideas laid the foundations for Western thought. Words like ‘democracy’, ‘philosophy’, and ‘astronomy’ are testimonials of Ancient Greek’s influence on today’s world. But let’s go into a little more detail.</p><h3 id="Ancient-Greek-influence-on-governance-and-philosophy"><a href="#Ancient-Greek-influence-on-governance-and-philosophy" class="headerlink" title="Ancient Greek influence on governance and philosophy"></a>Ancient Greek influence on governance and philosophy</h3><p> Given the fact that democracy and republicanism originated in ancient Greece, it’s no wonder that the lexicon of modern governance is replete with Greek-rooted words.</p><p> The principles of Western political thought were shaped by the Greek ideals of democracy, rooted in the philosophies of thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates. More precisely, <strong>the ideas laid out in Aristotle’s_Politics_ have become integral to how modern societies practice democracy.</strong></p><p> At the same time, the ideas of these influential thinkers on logic, ethics, and metaphysics also continue to influence contemporary philosophical debates and guide our exploration of fundamental questions about existence, morality, and the nature of reality. Their brilliant minds concocted theses that are still relevant millennia later. Isn’t it mind-blowing?</p><p> If you had any doubts about ancient Greece’s influence, know that the word ‘philosophy’ itself is of Greek origin. It is derived from ‘philosophia’, which means “love of wisdom”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/themes/mondly/img/mondly-banner-icon.png"                      alt="mondly banner icon" title="Ancient Greek Language Influence On Modern Languages 7"                ></p><h5 id="Learn-the-language-of-the-Greek-gods"><a href="#Learn-the-language-of-the-Greek-gods" class="headerlink" title="Learn the language of the Greek gods"></a>Learn the language of the Greek gods</h5><p> If Zeus needed to improve his Modern Greek, he’d probably choose Mondly.

The epic tales of gods, goddesses, demigods, and heroes have inspired numerous artists, writers, and thinkers to create their next big work of art. If you look into it, you’ll see that the influence of Greek myths can still be found everywhere, from literature and sculpture to popular culture and advertising.</p><p> At the same time, the ancient Greek epics and plays are also foundational for Western literature. Some of the most popular tragedies and comedies in history are still those of ancient Greece. Examples include<strong>the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides</strong> and<strong>the comedies of Aristophanes.</strong></p><p> Just as significant for the modern world are the ancient Greek art and architecture. The principles of symmetry, harmony, and proportionality influenced Western architectural designs, including the construction of monuments and public buildings. The Greek column, for example, is a beloved element we’ve seen even in fashion!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123731/7443" target="_top" id="2123731">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123731" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123731/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Ancient-Greek-influence-on-science-and-mathematics"><a href="#Ancient-Greek-influence-on-science-and-mathematics" class="headerlink" title="Ancient Greek influence on science and mathematics"></a>Ancient Greek influence on science and mathematics</h3><p> If we ask scientists, they’ll say that ancient Greeks made their most significant contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. For example, <strong>the principles and theorems formulated by Pythagoras are integral to the scientific heritage that has shaped Western civilization.</strong> Nowadays, children as young as 12 or 13 learn Pythagoras’ theorems in geometry – which, by the way, is another word of Greek origin.</p><p> Another excellent example of how the great thinkers of ancient Greece influenced the way our world looks like today is Hippocrates. Considered<strong>the “Father of Modern Medicine”, Hippocrates’</strong> name is well-known even by those not familiar with medical practices due to his famous ethics oath called<strong>the Hippocratic Oath.</strong> Initially, the oath mandated a new physician to vow, invoking several healing deities, to adhere to particular ethical guidelines. It represents the Western world’s first articulation of medical ethics, laying down foundational principles that continue to be critically important even in today’s medical ethics.</p><p> As you can see, Ancient Greece’s cultural influence is a treasure trove of wisdom that continues to inspire and shape the Western world to this day. These were only a few of the ideas and personalities that persisted through the ages. If you care to study the entire period of Ancient Greece, you’ll discover that many more people thought, said, or did great things during this time. So many that we start to wonder whether they had access to a magical fountain of endless inspiration!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ancient-greek-vs-modern-greek.jpg"                      alt="ancient Greek vs modern Greek" title="Ancient Greek Language Influence On Modern Languages 8"                ></p><h2 id="Ancient-Greek-Language-Influence-on-Modern-Languages"><a href="#Ancient-Greek-Language-Influence-on-Modern-Languages" class="headerlink" title="Ancient Greek Language Influence on Modern Languages"></a>Ancient Greek Language Influence on Modern Languages</h2><p> Now that you have an overview of the intellectual and artistic heritage we received from ancient Greece, it’s time to take an even closer look at languages. Because yes, the Ancient Greek language has carved its imprints not just in the annals of history but in the very syntax and semantics of modern languages. <strong>English, Spanish, and French are probably the most important bearers of Greek influences.</strong></p><p> Whenever you say a word like ‘psychology’, ‘theater’, or ‘chronology’, you pay tribute to the ancient Greek language. Still, the linguistic legacy is not limited to vocabulary but extends to idiomatic expressions, grammatical structures, and even rhetorical styles. Keep in mind the fact that this influence happened despite the geographical distance between ancient Greece and the English-speaking world.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144284/7443" target="_top" id="2144284">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144284" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144284/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Enriching-the-modern-lexicon"><a href="#Enriching-the-modern-lexicon" class="headerlink" title="Enriching the modern lexicon"></a>Enriching the modern lexicon</h3><p> So, how does the ancient Greek language live on through the modern languages? Well, as we already settled, one of the most striking manifestations of its influence is on the vocabulary. The terms beginning with ‘ph-’ are probably the most obvious examples. <strong>Words like ‘philosophy’, ‘physical’, ‘photograph’, ‘phrase’, and ‘philanthropy’ all have roots in ancient Greek.</strong></p><p> What’s more, they are all very similar in all major languages. Let’s take ‘geography’ for instance. The word came in English from French, which in turn got it from Latin. Finally, Latin borrowed the word from the Greek_geōgraphia,_ with_gē_ meaning ‘earth’ and_-graphia_ meaning ‘writing’. A fascinating journey to be had for a single word! Now, if you look at how to say ‘geography’ in different languages, you’ll notice that all of them are very similar:</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >French <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> : <em>géographie</em></li><li>German: <em>Geografie</em></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> : <em>geografía</em></li></ul><p> As you can see, <strong>ancient Greek words have infiltrated the English language through a complex route, often via Latin and French,</strong> but their imprint is unmistakable. Although modern English contains numerous borrowed words from languages such as French, Italian, and Spanish, a significant portion of them actually originate from ancient Greek.</p><p> This is just one example among countless others where a modern English word owes its existence to Ancient Greek ancestry. As a matter of fact, it’s estimated that <strong>more than 150,000 English words can be traced back to their Greek origins.</strong></p><h2 id="English-words-of-Greek-origin"><a href="#English-words-of-Greek-origin" class="headerlink" title="English words of Greek origin"></a>English words of Greek origin</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>English word</strong></th><th><strong>Greek origin</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>biology</td><td>from ‘bios’ (life) + ‘logia’ (study), referring to the study of life and living organisms</td></tr><tr><td>mathematics</td><td>from ‘máthēma’ meaning ‘that which is learnt’</td></tr><tr><td>astronomy</td><td>from the adjective ‘astronomos’ meaning ‘star-arranging’</td></tr><tr><td>philosophy</td><td>from ‘philos’ (love) + ‘sophia’ (wisdom), meaning the love of wisdom</td></tr><tr><td>psychology</td><td>from ‘psyche’ (soul) + ‘logia’ (study), referring to the study of the soul</td></tr><tr><td>politics</td><td>from ‘politiká’ meaning ‘affairs of the cities’</td></tr><tr><td>democracy</td><td>from ‘dēmos’ (people) + ‘kratia’ (power or rule), signifying a system where power is vested in the people</td></tr><tr><td>anatomy</td><td>from ‘ana’ (up) + ‘tomia’ (cutting) meaning dissection, it refers to the study of the body’s structure</td></tr><tr><td>academy</td><td>from Akadēmos, the hero after whom Plato’s garden was named</td></tr><tr><td>bibliography</td><td>from ‘biblion’ (book) + ‘graphia’ (writing), referring to the listing of books and other written works</td></tr><tr><td>chronology</td><td>from ‘chronos’ (time) + ‘logia’ (study), it refers to the arrangement of events in time order</td></tr><tr><td>dinosaur</td><td>from ‘deinos’ (terrible) + ‘sauros’ (lizard)</td></tr><tr><td>telephone</td><td>from ‘tēle’ (far) + ‘phonē’ (sound)</td></tr><tr><td>atmosphere</td><td>from ‘atmos’ (vapor) + “sphaira” (sphere)</td></tr><tr><td>theology</td><td>from ‘theos’ (god) + ‘logia’ (study)</td></tr><tr><td>cardiology</td><td>from ‘kardiā’ (heart) + ‘logia’ (study)</td></tr><tr><td>technology</td><td>from ‘tekhnē’ (art, craft) + ‘logia’ (study)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Expressions-that-originated-from-Greek"><a href="#Expressions-that-originated-from-Greek" class="headerlink" title="Expressions that originated from Greek"></a>Expressions that originated from Greek</h2><p> Apart from <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Latin phrases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the only thing that can make you sound like a true erudite without much work are the expressions that originated from Greek.</p><p> As we already discussed, ancient Greece and its fascinating mythology have been very influential in Western culture. And if you need more proof to be sure of it, stick around, and let’s look at some<strong>iconic expressions that originated from Greek myths.</strong></p><h3 id="1-Achilles’-heel"><a href="#1-Achilles’-heel" class="headerlink" title="1. Achilles’ heel"></a>1. Achilles’ heel</h3><p><em>Describes a weakness in spite of overall great strength or resilience.</em></p><p> According to the legend, Achilles’ mother, Thetis, dipped him into the River Styx to prevent his foretold death. However, she held him by the heel, making it his vulnerability later in life. Achilles was ultimately killed during the Trojan War from wounds to his heel, ankle, and torso.</p><h3 id="2-Pandora’s-box"><a href="#2-Pandora’s-box" class="headerlink" title="2. Pandora’s box"></a>2. Pandora’s box</h3><p> <em>Refers to something that creates a lot of new problems that you did not expect.</em></p><p> The myth of Pandora’s box originates from the story where Prometheus steals fire from the gods to give to mankind. As a punishment for humanity, the gods create Pandora, the first woman, and give her a box with strict instructions not to open it. Overcome by curiosity, Pandora opens the box, releasing all the world’s troubles. Only Hope remains trapped inside.</p><h3 id="3-Herculean-task"><a href="#3-Herculean-task" class="headerlink" title="3. Herculean task"></a>3. Herculean task</h3><p><strong>Refers to a task that requires extremely great strength or effort.</strong></p><p> Hercules, a hero born from Zeus and a human mother, was renowned for his immense strength. According to the legend, Hera, Zeus’ wife, cast a spell on Hercules that drove him mad and caused him to kill his wife and their two children. Remorseful and devastated, Hercules sought out Apollo, the god of truth and healing and another son of Zeus, pleading to be penalized for his actions.</p><p> Thus, he was tasked with completing twelve extremely challenging “labors”. These labors included daunting tasks such as retrieving the guardian dog from the underworld and defeating the multi-headed Hydra. Hence, the term ‘Herculean’ describes any job or task that is incredibly difficult and requires enormous strength.</p><h3 id="4-The-Midas-Touch"><a href="#4-The-Midas-Touch" class="headerlink" title="4. The Midas Touch"></a>4. The Midas Touch</h3><p><em>Refers to a person who has good fortune.</em></p><p> The phrase originates from the Greek myth of King Midas of Phrygia, who was granted a wish by the god Dionysus. Midas wished that everything he touched would turn to gold. Unfortunately, this blessing became a curse as his food, water, wine, and even his beloved daughter Zoe turned to gold upon his touch, illustrating the unintended consequences of his ill-considered desire for wealth.</p><h3 id="5-The-Apple-of-Discord"><a href="#5-The-Apple-of-Discord" class="headerlink" title="5. The Apple of Discord"></a>5. The Apple of Discord</h3><p> <em>Refers to an object or issue that causes strife, contention, or rivalry among those who encounter or possess it.</em></p><p> The expression ‘apple of discord’ originates from ancient Greek mythology. It refers to a golden apple inscribed with the words ‘to the fairest’ that was thrown into a feast of the gods by Eris, the goddess of discord. Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite all claimed the apple, leading to a dispute that eventually resulted in the Trojan War.</p><p> These are just a few of the witty expressions Greek myths left us with. So, feel free to expand your search and use them wisely in your day-to-day conversations. Not only are they a fun way to sound cooler, but they will also broaden your knowledge of the world. I mean, you definitely can not call someone a ‘narcissist’ without knowing Narcissus’ legend, right?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/what-is-greeces-language.jpg"                      alt="what is greece&#39;s language" title="Ancient Greek Language Influence On Modern Languages 9"                ></p><h2 id="Differences-Between-Ancient-Greek-and-Modern-Greek"><a href="#Differences-Between-Ancient-Greek-and-Modern-Greek" class="headerlink" title="Differences Between Ancient Greek and Modern Greek"></a>Differences Between Ancient Greek and Modern Greek</h2><p> Centuries of political, social, and cultural transformations, coupled with the dispersion of Greek populations and industrial changes, have profoundly influenced the evolution and richness of the Greek language. Thus, the transition from the ancient Greek language to the modern Greek language was all about adaptation and evolution. The language spoken in Plato’s Greece is indeed very different from the language spoken today in Greece. However, it is said that <strong>a person proficient in Modern Greek can generally understand about 50% of ancient Greek texts</strong> due to similar root words.</p><p> So, how different is ancient Greek from modern Greek? Let’s take a closer look.</p><ul><li><strong>Phonetics:</strong> The evolution from Ancient to Modern Greek involved significant phonetic and semantic changes, affecting both the sound and meaning of words. For example, Ancient Greek featured long and short vowels (which were important for poetry), various diphthongs, single and double consonants, and different types of stops. In contrast, modern Greek now has only short vowels and consonants. In addition, the pronunciation of several combinations of vowels (diphthongs) has also changed.</li><li><strong>Grammar:</strong> Ancient Greek had five cases and features like a dual number to refer to pairs and specific moods for desires and self-affected actions. Modern Greek, on the other hand, retains the dative case only in specific expressions and has dropped the dual number. Besides, certain verb forms and moods present in Ancient Greek are absent.</li><li><strong>Orthography:</strong> While ancient Greek used the polytonic orthography with many accents and only capital letters, modern Greek keeps only two <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek%5Fdiacritics" >diacritics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and uses both small and capital letters like in English.</li></ul><p> All in all, the transformation from ancient to modern Greek is characterized by a movement towards phonetic, grammatical, and semantic simplification while retaining core elements of the language’s rich history.</p><p> To summarize everything we learned about the ancient Greek language, let’s look at some frequently asked questions.</p><h3 id="Is-ancient-Greek-still-spoken-today"><a href="#Is-ancient-Greek-still-spoken-today" class="headerlink" title="Is ancient Greek still spoken today?"></a>Is ancient Greek still spoken today?</h3><p> Just like Latin, the ancient Greek language is still used in scholarly circles and ecclesiastical domains, preserved in texts and liturgies. However, nobody speaks ancient Greek natively anymore.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118311/7443" target="_top" id="2118311">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118311" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118311/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-are-the-main-influences-of-ancient-Greek-on-the-English-language"><a href="#What-are-the-main-influences-of-ancient-Greek-on-the-English-language" class="headerlink" title="What are the main influences of ancient Greek on the English language?"></a>What are the main influences of ancient Greek on the English language?</h3><p> A lot of English words, concepts, and idiomatic expressions are of Greek origin.

It is hypothesized to be descended from the older Linear A script which is undeciphered. However, around the 8th century BCE, Greeks adopted the Greek alphabet used today.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1484963">                    <video width="864" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1484963.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484963">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1484963.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1484963%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484963/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-can-I-learn-to-speak-ancient-Greek"><a href="#How-can-I-learn-to-speak-ancient-Greek" class="headerlink" title="How can I learn to speak ancient Greek?"></a>How can I learn to speak ancient Greek?</h3><p> Learning to speak ancient Greek may prove difficult because we still don’t know how the ancient Greek language sounded.

Learning a second language isn’t going to be a quick task, in fact, it takes many years to perfect your speech patterns so fluent speakers will understand you and not give you a confused sideways head nod. You’ll need to be dedicated and stick with it, even if you’re just learning in your spare time, you will have to learn a bit here and there even if you’re just reviewing what you learned last week. Keeping the content fresh in your mind will help you when you decide to learn a new chapter or set of words and that means you won’t be set back due to work or personal obligations.</p><p> There are many reasons why it is important to learn a second, third, or even fourth language and the base of all that is you just want to expand your mind a bit more than you already have. Why is it important, you ask? Well, you will expand your mind and notice that you’re actually getting smarter and you’re remembering a lot more throughout your day simply because you’re studying a second language. It’s amazing how your mind works, and not many people think learning a second language can actually help you remember things, but you’ll essentially be putting your mind in the weight room and going through a good workout. The more you work out your mind, the more you remember, and the quicker you will get your tasks done.</p><h2 id="5-reasons-why-you-should-learn-a-foreign-language-in-2022"><a href="#5-reasons-why-you-should-learn-a-foreign-language-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="5 reasons why you should learn a foreign language in 2022"></a>5 reasons why you should learn a foreign language in 2022</h2><p> Most of the time a person will <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn a new language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> because they made a new years resolution to do so. Then there are other people who want to learn for more economical or business-related reasons, such as:</p><h4 id="Reason-1-You-love-the-culture-and-plan-to-travel"><a href="#Reason-1-You-love-the-culture-and-plan-to-travel" class="headerlink" title="Reason 1: You love the culture and plan to travel"></a>Reason 1: You love the culture and plan to travel</h4><p> A lot of people like to learn a second or third language because they travel to specific destinations a few times a year and just want to speak to the locals in the area. Even if you were to study the language for a few months you’d be well equipped to hold a small conversation with anyone in the area you travel to.</p><h4 id="Reason-2-You-want-your-resume-to-look-better"><a href="#Reason-2-You-want-your-resume-to-look-better" class="headerlink" title="Reason 2: You want your resume to look better"></a>Reason 2: You want your resume to look better</h4><p> When you’re writing up a resume you will now be able to add in the specific languages you know. This will show your potential employers that you’ve taken the time to learn a second or third language even though it may never help you in the business world. Employers like this because you did something educational that you didn’t have to and it will also help because your possible employer will know you could talk to clients or customers that may speak the languages you know.</p><h4 id="Reason-3-Your-dream-job-requires-it"><a href="#Reason-3-Your-dream-job-requires-it" class="headerlink" title="Reason 3: Your dream job requires it"></a>Reason 3: Your dream job requires it</h4><p> Some people like learning specific languages because they want to expand their mind while others do it for a dream job they’ve had their eye on. Yes, some jobs require you to be multilingual and this means the number of slots for these positions is pretty small. By knowing the specific languages necessary for these positions you will get your application and resume pushed to the top of the pile and likely get a call back for the job over the people who only know a single language.</p><h4 id="Reason-4-You-break-down-language-barriers"><a href="#Reason-4-You-break-down-language-barriers" class="headerlink" title="Reason 4: You break down language barriers"></a>Reason 4: You break down language barriers</h4><p> Even if you’re not learning a language for business purposes, you will be able to break down language barriers when out and about doing your day to day tasks. How many people have you seen at a Mexican restaurant speaking Spanish when they order? The waiter&#x2F;waitress that learned Spanish as their first language will likely be able to take your order much easier, which will create a bond between the two of you, and it’s all because you took the time to learn a second language that you really didn’t have to.</p><h4 id="Reason-5-You’ll-increase-brain-activity"><a href="#Reason-5-You’ll-increase-brain-activity" class="headerlink" title="Reason 5: You’ll increase brain activity"></a>Reason 5: You’ll increase brain activity</h4><p> One of the most beneficial things that come from learning a second language in 2019 is your brain will become more active. When your brain becomes more active you will notice it’s easier to remember things and you will feel more fulfilled at the end of each day. Learning something new, other than the second language you’re studying, will seem to stick within your memory all because you’ve been keeping your brain active.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://oneplusfr.sjv.io/c/5597632/1622438/14044" target="_top" id="1622438">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14044-1622438" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://oneplusfr.sjv.io/i/5597632/1622438/14044"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="10-languages-that-will-help-you-land-a-new-job"><a href="#10-languages-that-will-help-you-land-a-new-job" class="headerlink" title="10 languages that will help you land a new job"></a>10 languages that will help you land a new job</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137208/26400" target="_top" id="2137208">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137208" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137208/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="languages-that-will-help-you-land-a-new-job"><a href="#languages-that-will-help-you-land-a-new-job" class="headerlink" title="languages that will help you land a new job"></a>languages that will help you land a new job</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/languages-that-will-help-you-land-a-new-job.jpg"                      alt="languages that will help you land a new job" title="The Importance Of Learning A Foreign Language 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> So you want to learn a second or third language in order to land an amazing job but don’t know which one to target right now?

That also means that <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Hindi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Arabic, and Japanese might be more difficult for you to learn and you might want to start off with something else.</p><p> Languages such as Spanish and Portuguese are very similar to each other and can likely be learned quickly right after each other. Once you know Spanish or Portuguese you can seamlessly slip into French since they have similar characteristics all of them being romance languages.</p><p> If you’re leaning more towards Chinese then you will likely want to aim for Mandarin since it’s the main language and Cantonese is more of a secondary for there. The transition from Mandarin to Cantonese isn’t too difficult, but you’ll still need to treat it as a new language even if you see similarities.</p><h3 id="Stick-with-your-new-language-even-if-you’re-not-using-it-each-day"><a href="#Stick-with-your-new-language-even-if-you’re-not-using-it-each-day" class="headerlink" title="Stick with your new language even if you’re not using it each day"></a>Stick with your new language even if you’re not using it each day</h3><p> One of the biggest things you need to remember when learning a new language is that you’ll need to stick with it. You need to treat it as if you were taking a test on it each month, just so you don’t forget anything, and you will notice you’re not forgetting much when speaking in your second or third language. You need to remember the importance of learning foreign languages isn’t to have a party trick in order to impress a boy or girl but it’s to expand your mind and learn more than you previously knew.</p><p> Learning a new language isn’t like riding a bike, you can’t take months or years to learn something and expect to be able to pick it up and peddle away after 10 years of not doing it. You’ll need to exercise your mind continuously throughout the year in order to keep the language fresh within your mind and not set yourself back a year or two because you go lazy.</p><p> A lot of people will learn a <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >foreign language while in school <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> because they’re either forced to or they took it as an elective because they were interested. It doesn’t matter if you’re in school or just want to learn, you need to be dedicated and stick with it if you really want to retain the information you’re going over time and time again.</p><p> In the end, learning a second or even a third language can help you land your dream job or just get you employed at a new company you see as a stepping stone. Employers will see you are bilingual, or trilingual, and see potential in you since knowing multiple languages tends to be a sign of intelligence for some people. You may see the importance of learning a foreign language and that means you’ll be ahead of the game when it comes to many things in life.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/importance-learning-foreign-language/&t=The+Importance+of+Learning+a+Foreign+Language"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2141687/17094" target="_top" id="2141687">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2141687" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluetties.sjv.io/i/5597632/2141687/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Speak-a-new-language-in-just-10-minutes-a-day"><a href="#Speak-a-new-language-in-just-10-minutes-a-day" class="headerlink" title="Speak a new language in just 10 minutes a day"></a>Speak a new language in just 10 minutes a day</h3><p> Want to become fluent fast?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Intersection-Of-AI-Educational-Language-Development"><a href="#The-Intersection-Of-AI-Educational-Language-Development" class="headerlink" title="The Intersection Of AI &amp; Educational Language Development"></a>The Intersection Of AI &amp; Educational Language Development</h2><p> The positive impact of AI in education is only starting to show. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been blowing off our minds for a while now, and this is only the beginning. As it continues to get smarter every day, we will soon have a more personalized learning experience than we have ever imagined. Before the pandemic, we may have been reluctant to adopt AI in education, but not anymore. Today, more and more people are starting to see the benefits of using AI to help humanity learn faster.</p><p> But what exactly is AI? Well, who better to ask that if not AI itself? Here’s what <a class="link"   href="https://openai.com/" >OpenAI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> said: “AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines that can think and act like humans. AI systems are designed to learn from their environment, recognize patterns, and adapt to changing situations. AI is used in a variety of industries, including healthcare, finance, and robotics.”</p><h2 id="The-future-of-AI-in-education"><a href="#The-future-of-AI-in-education" class="headerlink" title="The future of AI in education"></a>The future of AI in education</h2><p> Let’s set the record straight right from the start:<strong>AI didn’t write these words. A human did.</strong> A human who has no reason to exaggerate the importance of AI. While some of us may be biased, fearing that AI will one day replace us, we have to stop for a second and reflect. Rather than replace real people, AI will enhance the efficacy and speed of our efforts, at least for now.</p><p> When it comes to education, the advantages are astounding. Just the other day, I used an AI-powered app to talk to Mozart. Just imagine that! I asked about his relationship with Antonio Salieri, his favorite piece he had ever composed and more. I was so self-aware that I even asked if he was bothered by my many questions.</p><p> However, talking to influential people in history to broaden your knowledge of different domains is just the tip of the iceberg. Here are just a few of<strong>the benefits of AI in education.</strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082535/7443" target="_top" id="2082535">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082535" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082535/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Instant-feedback-for-students"><a href="#Instant-feedback-for-students" class="headerlink" title="Instant feedback for students"></a>Instant feedback for students</h3><p> Having 25 students in your class makes it virtually impossible to give real-time feedback to everyone. Then it’s also the matter of the tests. Teachers spend hours correcting and grading for just one class. Meanwhile, as a student, waiting for an important test result can be stressful. And when it finally arrives, you no longer remember your answer, so it’s hard to know what area you should improve.</p><p> Nevertheless, using AI could change all. Even as it is today, AI has the power to give instant feedback to all students at once. Teachers would no longer spend countless hours grading and students would get feedback in real time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118319/7443" target="_top" id="2118319">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118319" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118319/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Personalized-lessons"><a href="#Personalized-lessons" class="headerlink" title="Personalized lessons"></a>Personalized lessons</h3><p> Personalized learning works best for knowledge gaps. There are always two, three or more students who understand the entire lesson from day 1, but what about those who don’t? AI could tailor the lesson content according to a student’s specific needs and help everyone get on the same page.</p><p> One of the best things about personalized learning is that it targets specific needs and learning methods. Everyone will get to learn in their own time and style.</p><h3 id="Better-engagement"><a href="#Better-engagement" class="headerlink" title="Better engagement"></a>Better engagement</h3><p> Using AI in the classroom could also help teachers speak the language of their students.

However, the unique French pronunciation can be hard to achieve if you are not French-born. But not impossible, especially if you use our French pronunciation guide!</p><p> If you work hard and train your speech muscles accordingly, you’ll be able to master the infamous French “r” and speak French_très bien_ in no time. The best way to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn French <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> pronunciation is not a secret.

Unlike English, where stress can fall on any syllable of the word, French is more evenly stressed. This means that each syllable gets equal time, whether it is stressed or not. Do you like the French pronunciation rules so far?</p><p> Additionally, another thing that causes confusion is the fact that – although having similar alphabets – English and French use different sounds for specific letters or groups of letters. Naturally, your brain associates these letters with the English sounds you already use and know.</p><p> Last but not least, your speech muscles aren’t used to these specific French sounds. It may seem ridiculous, but learning a new language is somehow like going to the gym. If the language you are trying to learn uses different speech muscles than your <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >mother language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you may experience muscle soreness. Basically, you have to train both your brain and speech muscles in order to speak French <em>comme un natif</em> (like a native) <em>.</em></p><p> There’s no need to worry, though. As you yourself find French difficult to pronounce, French people sometimes find English hard to pronounce.

The Gioconda of French pronunciation. And yet… an endless source of headaches for almost every beginner learning French: the infamous French “r”.</p><p> It seems as though knowing how to pronounce the French “r” will make you sound like a native on the spot, but that’s not true. Not everyone can master the guttural “r”. And you know what? No one will judge you if your French guttural “r” is not spot on. Besides, even French speakers don’t give up that “uvular trill” sometimes.</p><p> Depending on what is your native language, the key is to practice several times before you find the sound closest to what you dream to achieve. There’s no secret. Just keep “r”-ing until you get it. You’ll eventually get there.</p><p>Repeat the phrase <strong><em>regardez mon frère</em></strong> and find out where right now.</p><h3 id="“u”-“eu”-and-“ue”-in-French"><a href="#“u”-“eu”-and-“ue”-in-French" class="headerlink" title="“u”, “eu” and “ue” in French"></a>“u”, “eu” and “ue” in French</h3><p> If you think about it, they all sound almost the same. But French is a language of subtle differences. Differences you will manage to master practicing.</p><p> Luckily, there is a starting point for pronouncing the French “u”. Step one is to start by shaping your lips into an “ooh” sound. Got it? Ok, now make your tongue say “eee”.</p><p> Aaaand you just said your first French “u” sound. Cool, isn’t it?</p><p> To master the other variables, you just have to continue practicing.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484950/16446" target="_top" id="1484950">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484950" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484950/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-nasal-sounds"><a href="#The-nasal-sounds" class="headerlink" title="The nasal sounds"></a>The nasal sounds</h3><p> Nasal sounds in French are just as important as the “r”. Maybe even more important. While it may not be utterly necessary to use that specific guttural “r”, the nasal sounds are a must.</p><p> So how do you do it? For example, start saying the word “song”, but stop just before your throat closes to produce the “ng” sound. <em>Voilà !</em> You’ve just pronounced the French word <em>cent</em> (“hundred”).</p><p> To practice the pronunciation of “in”, ”ain” or ”eint”, start saying the word “clang” and stop just before your throat closes into the “ng” sound. Now, try again without the “kl” sound in the beginning. It’s easy!</p><h3 id="e-e-e-and-e"><a href="#e-e-e-and-e" class="headerlink" title="ë, è, é and ê"></a>ë, è, é and ê</h3><p> There are so many “e”s in French! How are they actually pronounced? Well, let’s see.</p><p><em><strong>ë</strong></em> is the easiest because it is always pronounced as “e” in “bet” (the open “e”) no matter what letters accompany it.</p><p><em><strong>è</strong></em> is pronounced the same – namely as “e” in “bet” – and it commonly appears in verb conjugations to mark the correct pronunciation. For example,<em>acheter</em> (to buy) is pronounced [ah-shuh-teh] and the middle “e” is reduced because it is the last letter of the syllable. Nevertheless, when we conjugate the verb, we need the grave accent to know how to pronounce it correctly:<em>j’achète</em> [ah-shet].</p><p><em><strong>é</strong></em> is pronounced the same way you pronounce it in the English word “may”, but without the second part of the vowel sound associated with the letter “y”.</p><p><strong><em>ê</em></strong> is pronounced the same way as <em><strong>è</strong> .</em></p><p>Well, not very different from each other, are they?</p><h3 id="The-silent-letters"><a href="#The-silent-letters" class="headerlink" title="The silent letters"></a>The silent letters</h3><p> Now, let’s talk about some letters you don’t actually get to pronounce: the silent letters.</p><p> So, how do you actually know which ones not to pronounce? Well, French silent letters can be divided into three categories: E_muet_ , H (<em>aspiré</em> and_muet_) and most final consonants.</p><p> While the first two are clear as day, “most final consonants” may seem a bit ambiguous. However, given the fact that you are only getting started, remember this: there are six French consonants that are usually silent at the end of a word.</p><ul><li>“d” – <em>canard</em> (“duck”), <em>froid</em> (“cold”), <em>grand</em> (“large”</li><li>“p” – <em>beaucoup</em> (“a lot”), <em>loup</em> (“wolf”)</li><li>“s” – <em>temps</em> (“time”), <em>trois</em> (“three”)</li><li>“t” – <em>petit</em> (“small”), <em>poulet</em> (“chicken”)</li><li>“x” – <em>deux</em> (“two”), <em>prix</em> (“prize”)</li><li>“z” – <em>chez</em> (“at”)</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/french-buildings-960x640.jpg"                      alt="french buildings" title="Quick Guide To French Pronunciation - How To Speak French Like A Native 3"                ></p><p> “French buildings” by Orlova Maria©</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135374/19272" target="_top" id="2135374">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135374" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135374/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-are-French-liaisons-and-how-to-master-them"><a href="#What-are-French-liaisons-and-how-to-master-them" class="headerlink" title="What are French liaisons and how to master them?"></a>What are French liaisons and how to master them?</h2><p>To put it simply, <em>French liaisons</em>  or French connecting sounds bind together two words by blending the last letter of a word with the first letter of the following word.</p><p> Although this makes it difficult for a beginner to determine where one word ends and the next one begins, <em>liaisons</em>  give a certain flow to the French language. If used correctly, <em>liaisons</em>  can make spoken French sounds like a continuous melody or – as we said before – a neverending ode to the gods of languages. Thus, they are definitely useful for someone who wants to perfect their French accent and pronunciation.</p><p> So, how do you actually pronounce letters in French <em>liaisons</em>  ? Well, it depends on the context. For example, <em>chez</em>  (as in “as someone’s home”) is pronounced “shay” (no “z” at the end) on its own. But if you want to say <em>chez Anne</em>  , you use the “z” to join the two words in a single, continuous pronunciation: “shay zanne”. It makes sense, doesn’t it?</p><p>Now, some of these <em>liaisons</em>  are optional, others are required, and some are forbidden (or, if you liked the well-known novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les%5FLiaisons%5Fdangereuses"><em>Les liaisons dangereuses</em></a>  , you can simply say they are dangerous to use). Let’s get into a little more detail.</p><h3 id="Required-French-liaisons"><a href="#Required-French-liaisons" class="headerlink" title="Required French liaisons"></a>Required French liaisons</h3><p> Generally,<em>liaisons</em> between syntactically related words (like an article and a noun, a pronoun and a verb or a noun and its adjective) are required. Of course, there are always exceptions, but the rule applies most of the time and it can help you improve your <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >French pronunciation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> fast. Here are a few examples:</p><ul><li><em>les amis</em>  [lay zah mee] – the friends (article + noun)</li><li><em>deux enfants</em> [deu za(n) fa(n)] – two children (numeral + noun)</li><li><em>vous avez</em> [voo zah vay] – you have (pronoun + verb)</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049382/7443" target="_top" id="2049382">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049382" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049382/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="“Dangereuses”-French-liaisons"><a href="#“Dangereuses”-French-liaisons" class="headerlink" title="“Dangereuses” French liaisons"></a>“Dangereuses” French liaisons</h3><p> Some_French liaisons_ are completely forbidden and if you want to speak French like a native, you should avoid them. This happens to avoid confusion with a similar expression or simply because, grammatically, these words aren’t linked enough to require a vocal link. Here are some situations where you shouldn’t use a_liaison_ :</p><ul><li>after a singular noun – <em>un garçon intelligent</em> (“a smart boy”)</li><li>before h aspiré (aspirated h)* – <em>les héros</em> (“the heroes”)</li><li>before <em>onze</em> and <em>you</em>  – <em>les onze enfants</em>  (“the eleven children”)</li><li>after a proper name – <em>Nicolas est prêt</em>  (“Nicolas is ready”)</li><li>after <em>et – avant et après</em> (“before and after”)</li><li>after inversions – <em>parlez-vous espagnol ?</em> (“do you speak Spanish?”)</li></ul><p> *<em>h aspiré</em> is different from h muet (“mute h”). It’s true that in French “h” is always a silent letter. However, in Old and Middle French, on certain words, the “h” was pronounced. This is why, if you want to say_les hôpitaux_  (“hospitals”), there is a_liaison_  between the two words because the “h” is_muet_  and not_aspiré._</p><h3 id="Optional-French-liaisons"><a href="#Optional-French-liaisons" class="headerlink" title="Optional French liaisons"></a>Optional French liaisons</h3><p> This time, it is up to you whether to use the_liaison_ or not. But you should know from the beginning that when the_liaison_ is optional, most people choose not to use it.</p><ul><li>after <em>pas</em> , <em>trop</em> and <em>fort</em>  – <em>il n’est pas à l’heure</em> (“he’s not on time”)</li><li>after plural nouns – <em>des livres utiles</em> (“useful books”)</li><li>between two-part verbal structures – <em>je suis allé</em> (“I went”)</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/interior-versailles-palace-1-960x640.jpg"                      alt="interior versailles palace" title="Quick Guide To French Pronunciation - How To Speak French Like A Native 4"                ></p><p> “Versailles Palace, France” by Louis Paulin©</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139558/4704" target="_top" id="2139558">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139558" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139558/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-perfect-your-French-pronunciation"><a href="#How-to-perfect-your-French-pronunciation" class="headerlink" title="How to perfect your French pronunciation"></a>How to perfect your French pronunciation</h2><p> There is no magic recipe that works for everyone.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Twin-Tongue-Transition-Training"><a href="#Twin-Tongue-Transition-Training" class="headerlink" title="Twin-Tongue Transition Training"></a>Twin-Tongue Transition Training</h2><p><em>Can you learn two languages at once?</em> If you asked the World Wide Web this question, you must be a language lover. And a brave one too! Many people ask whether they can learn German in a year. You, on the other hand, raised the bar high. You don’t want to learn_<strong>a</strong>_ language. No. You want to learn_<strong>multiple</strong>_ languages at once. Good for you!</p><p> Considering your bravery, we’re honored to answer your inquiry. As a matter of fact, we’re a language learning app ourselves, so we have a lot of experience with learning (and teaching) multiple languages. Here we go!</p><h2 id="Can-you-learn-two-languages-at-once"><a href="#Can-you-learn-two-languages-at-once" class="headerlink" title="Can you learn two languages at once?"></a>Can you learn two languages at once?</h2><p> <strong>The short answer is_yes_ .</strong> If you set your mind to learning two languages at once, you can do it. However, before taking on this task, there are a lot of things you should consider.</p><p> Many will either give a hard yes or a hard no. But, in reality, the situation is far from black or white. It all depends on you and your abilities and limitations. You can do it if you are determined and stick to it until the end. If not, the entire process will prove extremely laborious.</p><p> Our biggest and most important advice is to<strong>choose two languages that are different from each other.</strong> Forget about trying to learn Spanish and Italian at the same time. The whole deal could end in you speaking “Spalian” and we don’t want that.</p><p> No, the secret is to balance things perfectly. So, choose two languages that share some similarities, but they are distinct enough not to cause confusion. Take English and German, for example. Their similarities will help you make beneficial connections, but not to the point where you mistake one for the other.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/themes/mondly/img/mondly-banner-icon.png"                      alt="mondly banner icon" title="Learn Multiple Languages At Once 2"                ></p><h5 id="Learn-two-languages-at-once"><a href="#Learn-two-languages-at-once" class="headerlink" title="Learn two languages at once"></a>Learn two languages at once</h5><p> With Mondly, you can learn not 2, but 41 languages at once.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-9547&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-9547&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-9547&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-9547&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-9547&mt=8" >Start now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Is-it-recommended-to-learn-two-languages-at-once"><a href="#Is-it-recommended-to-learn-two-languages-at-once" class="headerlink" title="Is it recommended to learn two languages at once?"></a>Is it recommended to learn two languages at once?</h2><p> Now, this is a whole different language. You can learn two languages at once, but is it recommended to do so? Not really.</p><p>Let me explain.</p><p> Despite what your boss says, multitasking is not good. It is indeed a cool word, but research has shown time and time again that<strong>multitasking is not productive.</strong> When you multi-task and learn multiple languages at once, it’s very<strong>hard to enter a state of deep focus</strong> that allows you to make connections and learn the language in an instinctive way.</p><p> Instead, it is easier and maybe even faster to learn the languages one after the other. This way, you will focus on only one language at a time, avoid confusion, and give your brain time to cement the knowledge before moving to a new lingo. That is if you’re serious about reaching fluency in two languages at once.</p><p> If you want to learn multiple languages for fun at a basic level, go for it. But again, it’s best to choose completely different languages so you can switch easily between them and not mix things up.</p><p> Take it from us, a language learning app teaching 41 languages.

We can all probably agree that the most important are the <a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875"><strong>cognitive benefits</strong></a> . Moreover, if you learn new languages, you will also become more<strong>culturally aware,</strong> which is one of the best things you can do for yourself. And the list goes on. Learning a new language is a true gold mine for you. Here are some of the benefits of language learning:</p><ul><li>career advantages;</li><li>improved communication skills;</li><li>boosted self-confidence;</li><li>personal satisfaction;</li><li>networking opportunities;</li><li>and more.</li></ul><p> Now, imagine what happens with all these benefits when you learn multiple languages at once. They double or maybe triple.</p><p> The winner of this equation is, undoubtedly, your brain. While it is hard to focus on learning multiple languages at once, if you manage to do it, it has loads of benefits for it as the process encourages the brain to form new neural connections. In turn, this leads to the grey matter becoming denser, which is good! Very good, in fact!</p><p> TL;DR: The benefits of learning multiple languages are many. However, the most important one is that it results in the enlargement of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, enhancing your brain’s health.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1912746">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1912746.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1912746">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1912746.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fmindmanager.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1912746%2F20231'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1912746/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-difficult-is-it-to-learn-multiple-languages-at-once"><a href="#How-difficult-is-it-to-learn-multiple-languages-at-once" class="headerlink" title="How difficult is it to learn multiple languages at once?"></a>How difficult is it to learn multiple languages at once?</h2><p> Difficult, but not impossible. Probably the most challenging part is to differentiate the languages you’re learning. For that, we recommend choosing completely different languages and creating unique study routines for all of them.</p><p> The difficulty of learning multiple languages at once also depends on how good you actually are at learning languages. We all know people who learn languages very fast and in a very natural way. These people probably have two very well-developed areas of the brain: Broca’s area and Wernicke’s area. One is responsible for the generation of articulate speech and the other is vital in the comprehension of written and spoken language.</p><p> For example, Ziad Youssef Fasah is a polyglot born in Liberia, brought up in Beirut, who also lived (and maybe still does) in Brazil. He claims to be able to speak 58 languages and be fluent in approximately 15 of them. A great feat, no doubt! Considering the astonishing number of languages he speaks, it’s safe to say he probably learned some of them at the same time. If he did it, it means it’s not impossible.</p><p> All in all, the difficulty level of learning multiple languages at once depends entirely on your capabilities. The more gifted you are at learning languages, the easier it will be.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/can-you-learn-two-languages-at-once-960x640.jpg"                      alt="can you learn two languages at once?" title="Learn Multiple Languages At Once 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136621/26400" target="_top" id="2136621">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136621" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136621/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-for-learning-multiple-languages-at-once"><a href="#Tips-for-learning-multiple-languages-at-once" class="headerlink" title="Tips for learning multiple languages at once"></a>Tips for learning multiple languages at once</h2><p> If you really want to learn, let’s say, two languages at once and cannot be convinced to leave one of them for later, these tips may come in handy.</p><h3 id="1-Choose-languages-that-are-different-from-each-other"><a href="#1-Choose-languages-that-are-different-from-each-other" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose languages that are different from each other"></a>1. Choose languages that are different from each other</h3><p> To avoid confusion when learning two languages at once, it’s best to choose different languages. And when we say different, we say<strong>different</strong> . Not Swedish and Danish and definitely not Spanish and Portuguese.</p><p> As you yourself know, these language pairs are very similar and learning them together may result in mix-ups. “What kind of mix-ups?” – you ask. Well, like using several Portuguese words in a Spanish sentence. For this reason, it’s best if you choose languages from different language families.</p><h3 id="2-Immerse-yourself-in-the-languages-as-much-as-possible"><a href="#2-Immerse-yourself-in-the-languages-as-much-as-possible" class="headerlink" title="2. Immerse yourself in the languages as much as possible"></a>2. Immerse yourself in the languages as much as possible</h3><p> Different languages reflect different cultures. By immersing yourself in them, you’ll not only be able to clearly differentiate between the languages you’re learning, but you will also get fluent faster.</p><h3 id="3-Create-a-smart-study-schedule"><a href="#3-Create-a-smart-study-schedule" class="headerlink" title="3. Create a smart study schedule"></a>3. Create a smart study schedule</h3><p> When learning multiple languages at once, it’s important to organize your time wisely.</p><p> Avoid studying both languages during the same study session, as you may get confused. Instead, create different study sessions for each language to help you have a clear separation of what you’re trying to learn. Maybe study one language in the morning and the other in the evenings. Or, even better, split the days of the week evenly between the languages you’re trying to learn. If you’re learning two languages, you can have three days for each and one day to let your brain rest.</p><h3 id="4-Try-a-different-learning-method-for-each-language"><a href="#4-Try-a-different-learning-method-for-each-language" class="headerlink" title="4. Try a different learning method for each language"></a>4. Try a different learning method for each language</h3><p> There are several learning styles you can use to study languages: visual (spatial), aural (auditory-musical), verbal (linguistic), physical (kinesthetic), logical (mathematical), social (interpersonal) and solitary (intrapersonal).</p><p> If more than one works for you, great! This means you can also use different learning styles for the languages you want to learn. For example, learning logically may work best if you want to learn the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Korean alphabet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> In addition, some areas of the curriculum might be better fitted to study using a language learning app such as <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-9547&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-9547&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-9547" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . So, try to mix things up. For instance, while you’re studying German grammar using textbooks, you can do conversation practice for Spanish with Mondly.</p><h3 id="5-Keep-going"><a href="#5-Keep-going" class="headerlink" title="5. Keep going"></a>5. Keep going</h3><p> Studying multiple languages at once can be hard work. If you feel like you aren’t making any progress, don’t fret. Change your routine and try again. Or take a break and try again. If you set your mind to it, you surely have what it takes to make it happen!</p><p>Can you learn two languages at once?

This usually occurs when a child is exposed consistently and naturally to both languages from an early age. This can happen in bilingual families, where each parent speaks a different language, in multilingual communities where several languages are part of daily life, or through early educational environments that emphasize bilingualism.</p><h3 id="How-can-I-become-fluent-in-two-languages"><a href="#How-can-I-become-fluent-in-two-languages" class="headerlink" title="How can I become fluent in two languages?"></a>How can I become fluent in two languages?</h3><p> To become fluent in two languages, you need to immerse yourself in both languages through consistent practice. This can be achieved by engaging with fluent speakers, consuming content in the target languages, taking courses, and using language learning apps and other resources. Regular practice in speaking, listening, reading, and writing is crucial, along with setting realistic goals and being patient with your progress.</p><h3 id="How-to-learn-multiple-languages"><a href="#How-to-learn-multiple-languages" class="headerlink" title="How to learn multiple languages?"></a>How to learn multiple languages?</h3><p> To learn multiple languages effectively, focus on immersive learning and consistent practice. Start by building a strong foundation in each language through structured courses or self-study, then enhance your skills by regularly engaging with native speakers, consuming media like films, music, and books in those said languages, and using language learning apps for daily practice. Balancing your time between languages, setting achievable goals, and immersing yourself in the cultures related to the languages can significantly boost your proficiency.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/learn-multiple-languages/&t=Learn+Multiple+Languages+at+Once"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016134/19272" target="_top" id="2016134">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016134" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016134/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Learn-multiple-languages-with-Mondly"><a href="#Learn-multiple-languages-with-Mondly" class="headerlink" title="Learn multiple languages with Mondly"></a>Learn multiple languages with Mondly</h3><p> Do you want to learn two languages at once?

If you’re head over heels for a Hungarian native speaker, learning how to say_I love you_ in Hungarian is a good strategy to win their heart for good. After all, nothing says_I love you_ like <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-6939&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6939&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6939" >learning their language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Until then, enjoy the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >language barrier <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the fullest.

Thus, the_<strong>-lek</strong>_ at the end accounts for “you.”</p><p> Besides, unlike other languages, Hungarian is a non-gendered language. This means you can say_Szeretlek_ to someone of either sex.</p><p> Supposing you want to find out if your feelings are reciprocated, you can ask_Te szeretsz engem?_ which means “Do you love me?”.</p><p> Last but not least, <strong>the word for “love” in Hungarian is_szeretet_ .</strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528703/16446" target="_top" id="1528703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528703/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Useful-Hungarian-words-and-phrases-for-lovebirds"><a href="#Useful-Hungarian-words-and-phrases-for-lovebirds" class="headerlink" title="Useful Hungarian words and phrases for lovebirds"></a>Useful Hungarian words and phrases for lovebirds</h2><p> While we’re at it, let’s also explore some useful Hungarian words and phrases related to romance and dating in general.

His name was St. Nicholas, and he was a monk in an area of the world now called Turkey. Known for intense generosity and devoting himself to the wellbeing of others, St. Nicholas spent his life traveling to poor areas of the country and donating his wealth to anyone who needed it. This reputation became legendary, and stories of St. Nicholas have been passed down through the generations and rewritten in various ways ever since.</p><p> Examining the Santa legend from the perspective of language learning is interesting. If Santa Claus was a real person today, what language would he speak? The area where the real St. Nicholas originated was once called Lycia, and the official language was Greek. Therefore, we can determine that Greek was Santa’s first spoken language.</p><h2 id="Santa-Claus-in-Various-Cultures-Christmas-in-All-Foreign-Languages"><a href="#Santa-Claus-in-Various-Cultures-Christmas-in-All-Foreign-Languages" class="headerlink" title="Santa Claus in Various Cultures: Christmas in All Foreign Languages"></a>Santa Claus in Various Cultures: Christmas in All Foreign Languages</h2><p> A variety of countries have their own legends about Santa, which is why he’s become such an interesting symbol of Christmas worldwide.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130869/7443" target="_top" id="2130869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Santa-Claus-in-Norway"><a href="#1-Santa-Claus-in-Norway" class="headerlink" title="1. Santa Claus in Norway"></a>1. Santa Claus in Norway</h3><p> The Norwegians have some unique ideas about Santa Claus. Rather than coming from Lycia like the original St. Nicholas, they believe Santa was born under a rock in an area north of the town of Drøbak. They also believe that Drøbak is where he currently resides. Historians believe that this legend may have came about due to the Norwegian belief in the elder god Odin. Santa and Odin have a few similarities, including a white beard and the tendency to go down the chimney with gifts. They also both have help from the animal kingdom. Santa has his reindeer, and Odin has an eight-legged horse.</p><p> The Norwegian contribution to the Santa legend means that Santa is likely fluent in Norwegian. That’s a wonderful thing for Norwegian kids, who send over 30,000 letters to Santa Claus each year. If Santa didn’t speak Norwegian, the kids would have to learn a language before writing him!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1815678/21290" target="_top" id="1815678">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1815678" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://versadesk.pxf.io/i/5597632/1815678/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Santa-Claus-in-Mexico"><a href="#2-Santa-Claus-in-Mexico" class="headerlink" title="2.

Since he’s been responding to the wishes of Spanish-speaking children in Mexico for many years, it makes sense to believe that Santa is <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >fluent in Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well.</p><h3 id="3-Santa-Claus-in-Russia"><a href="#3-Santa-Claus-in-Russia" class="headerlink" title="3. Santa Claus in Russia"></a>3. Santa Claus in Russia</h3><p> The Russian culture has its own unique spin on the Santa tale. Referred to as Ded Moroz, the Russian Santa has a long, white beard similar to the other versions. However, he dresses in Russian clothing and carries a large staff. His gifts arrive on New Years Eve rather than Christmas, and instead of the classic elves, he is assisted by his granddaughter, the Snow Maiden.</p><p> Even if the story is a bit different, the Russians seem to have a strong grasp on the Santa concept. That must mean that Santa has spent time in the country and can certainly <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >speak Russian <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as a result!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/994842/11832" target="_top" id="994842">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-994842" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/994842/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Santa-Claus-in-Sweden"><a href="#4-Santa-Claus-in-Sweden" class="headerlink" title="4.

He brings presents to children with the help of other gnomes, similar to the elf legend we see in other versions of the story. In Sweden, Christmas extends all the way to January 13th, when Christmas trees are officially taken down. With all that extra time in Sweden, it makes sense that Santa would have picked up Swedish.</p><h3 id="5-Santa-Claus-in-Finland"><a href="#5-Santa-Claus-in-Finland" class="headerlink" title="5. Santa Claus in Finland"></a>5. Santa Claus in Finland</h3><p> In Finland, the origins of the Santa legend are borderline spooky. Referred to as Joulupukki, the Finnish Santa has horns on his head and was once considered a symbol of fertility. People in the area believe that Joulupukki lives in the northern part of the country with Mother Christmas and their helper gnomes, which means that Santa is certainly fluent in the language.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/languages-santa-claus-speak-christmas-around-world/&t=What+Languages+Does+Santa+Claus+Speak?+Christmas+Around+the+World"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657400/16446" target="_top" id="1657400">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657400" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657400/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Learn-a-Language-Like-Santa-It-Won’t-Take-Long"><a href="#Learn-a-Language-Like-Santa-It-Won’t-Take-Long" class="headerlink" title="Learn a Language Like Santa: It Won’t Take Long"></a>Learn a Language Like Santa: It Won’t Take Long</h2><p> Santa has had many centuries to venture around the world learning languages and helping kids, but you won’t have to wait that long to learn the language of your choice.

I’m glad to see you love the French language as much as I do! In some of the previous lessons, we’ve talked about <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >French phrases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >French movies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >best way to learn French <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but for today’s lesson it’s time to go back to the basics and learn how to say “hello” in French. Of course, we all know and love the classic_Bonjour!_ But what are other French greetings we could use to diversify our French conversations?</p><h2 id="The-most-common-way-to-say-“hello”-in-French-Bonjour"><a href="#The-most-common-way-to-say-“hello”-in-French-Bonjour" class="headerlink" title="The most common way to say “hello” in French:Bonjour!"></a>The most common way to say “hello” in French:<em>Bonjour!</em></h2><p> Literally meaning “good day”,<em>Bonjour</em> is the most commonly used French greeting. Whether you go to a restaurant, meet someone randomly on the street or enter a_boulangerie_ (pastry shop), the French people you meet will probably greet you using Bonjour (if it’s not dark outside). If it’s getting dark, then you should consider switching to “good evening” in French:<em>Bonsoir.</em></p><p> The most awesome thing about_Bonjour_ is that it is a quite universal greeting. This means <strong>you can use it safely in all kinds of social contexts and interactions</strong> – regardless of the level of formality (or the lack of it).</p><p> But everyone wants to make a change from time to time. So let’s dive into 12 ways to say hello in French that are not_Bonjour._</p><h2 id="1-“Hi”-in-French-–Salut"><a href="#1-“Hi”-in-French-–Salut" class="headerlink" title="1. “Hi” in French –Salut!"></a>1. “Hi” in French –<em>Salut!</em></h2><p> Just as commonly used, but a bit more informal,<em>Salut</em> is what we could call_Bonjour_ ’s cool kid.</p><p> Meaning “hi”, “hello” or sometimes even “bye”,<em>Salut</em> is the informal French greeting you can use with family and friends but not with your boss or teacher.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148641/16836" target="_top" id="2148641">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148641" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="254" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148641/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-“Good-morning”-in-French-–Bon-matin"><a href="#2-“Good-morning”-in-French-–Bon-matin" class="headerlink" title="2. “Good morning” in French –Bon matin!"></a>2. “Good morning” in French –<em>Bon matin!</em></h2><p> European French doesn’t have an equivalent for “good morning”. So it’s good to know that while in France you shouldn’t use Bon matin. But if you happen to spend a charming morning in Paris, you can safely use – you guessed it –<em>Bonjour!</em></p><p> However, if you are in Quebec, you are free to use_Bon matin_ until 10 or 11 AM.</p><h2 id="3-“Good-afternoon”-in-French-–Bon-apres-midi"><a href="#3-“Good-afternoon”-in-French-–Bon-apres-midi" class="headerlink" title="3. “Good afternoon” in French –Bon après-midi!"></a>3. “Good afternoon” in French –<em>Bon après-midi!</em></h2><p> While it’s used less often than its brothers,<em>Bon après-midi</em> is a nice twist to_Bonjour_ .</p><p> But take notice! French speakers generally use it when they are saying goodbye, so you should follow their lead and avoid using it at the beginning of a conversation.</p><h2 id="4-“Good-evening”-in-French-–Bonsoir"><a href="#4-“Good-evening”-in-French-–Bonsoir" class="headerlink" title="4. “Good evening” in French –Bonsoir!"></a>4. “Good evening” in French –<em>Bonsoir!</em></h2><p> The same as the_clasique Bonjour_ ,<em>Bonsoir</em> is a universal greeting suitable for most social contexts. The only restriction is the moment of the day. So once the twilight settles in, it is safe to switch from_Bonjour_ to_Bonsoir_ !</p><h2 id="5-“Good-night”-in-French-–Bonne-nuit"><a href="#5-“Good-night”-in-French-–Bonne-nuit" class="headerlink" title="5. “Good night” in French –Bonne nuit!"></a>5. “Good night” in French –<em>Bonne nuit!</em></h2><p> Literally meaning “good night”,<em>Bonne nuit</em> is used more as a “goodbye” than as a “hello”. So if you are spending time with your French friends,<em>Bonne nuit</em> is a great way to let them them know you are retiring.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/french-greetings-scaled-722x960.jpg"                      alt="french greetings" title="How To Say Hello In French: 12 Useful French Greetings 2"                ></p><p> “French fashion” by Charles 🇵🇭©</p><h2 id="6-Hello-–Allo"><a href="#6-Hello-–Allo" class="headerlink" title="6. Hello? –Allô?"></a>6. Hello? –<em>Allô?</em></h2><p> Although it is not specific to face to face interactions,<em>Allô</em> is still considered a greeting.</p><p> Usually expressed with the raising tone of a question,<em>Allô</em> is what you could say over the phone to check whether the person you are talking to is still on the other end of the line or not:<em>Allô?</em></p><h2 id="7-Excuse-me-–Excusez-moi"><a href="#7-Excuse-me-–Excusez-moi" class="headerlink" title="7. Excuse me? –Excusez-moi?"></a>7. Excuse me? –<em>Excusez-moi?</em></h2><p> Looking for a polite way to get someone’s attention in French? Maybe there’s someone blocking your way in the store or maybe you want to get noticed by the office clerk. In these situations, a classic greeting would be a bit redundant. So instead you could use this “question-like”<em>Excusez-moi?</em> that has a double meaning and works as both a greeting and a way to get someone’s attention.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938698/19272" target="_top" id="1938698">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938698" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938698/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-“How-are-you”-in-French-–Comment-ca-va"><a href="#8-“How-are-you”-in-French-–Comment-ca-va" class="headerlink" title="8. “How are you” in French –Comment ça va?"></a>8. “How are you” in French –<em>Comment ça va?</em></h2><p> Almost equally as notorious as_Bonjour_ ,<em>Comment ça va?</em> can be used the same way we use the English “how are you?”: directly on its own or together with another greeting. For example, you can simply say_Comment ça va?_ (“How are you?) or_Bonjour! Comment ça va?_ (”Hello! How are you?“).</p><p> If someone says_Comment ça va?_ to you, you can respond with_Ça va bien, merci!_ (“I’m good, thanks!”),<em>Ça va bien. Et toi?</em> (“I’m good. And you?”) or_Pas mal_ (“Not bad”).</p><p> Or you can play it simple, follow the lead of the French speakers and answer directly with_Et toi?_ (“And you?”) since the_Ça va bien_ (“I’m good”) answer is usually implied.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094422/7443" target="_top" id="2094422">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094422" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094422/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="9-What’s-up-–Ca-va"><a href="#9-What’s-up-–Ca-va" class="headerlink" title="9. What’s up? –Ça va?"></a>9. What’s up? –<em>Ça va?</em></h2><p> The English translation of_Ça va?_ , the little and cooler brother of_Comment ça va?_ , is “how’s it going” or literally “does it go?” and it can be used exactly the same like in the previous examples.</p><p> The only slight difference is the level for formality associated of each phrase:<em>Ça va?</em> is obviously more suitable for informal interactions with friends and family.</p><h2 id="10-What’s-up-–Quoi-de-neuf"><a href="#10-What’s-up-–Quoi-de-neuf" class="headerlink" title="10. What’s up? –Quoi de neuf?"></a>10. What’s up? –<em>Quoi de neuf?</em></h2><p> Want to spice up and diversify your “ça-va”s?

The app offers instant immersion, feedback on pronunciation, suggestions that enrich learners’ vocabulary, and interactive scenarios that make learning languages fun and easy.</p><p>Check out this fun, short video:</p><p> Alex Iliescu, CEO of Mondly, spoke recently about why Mondly identified VR early-on as the future of language learning: “   <em>We realized the best way to teach languages would be to create an immersive experience that replicates real-life scenarios and conversations. VR gives us the best opportunity to do this.”</em></p><p>Alex continues   <em>“From our experience, the biggest things that keep people from actually speaking and using new languages are fear and lack of life-like practice. Mondly VR overcomes these barriers and quickly gets learners comfortable and speaking in real-life situations. We’re filling the conversational gap of traditional language education.</em> ”</p><p> Before Mondly VR, to experience language immersion – it typically required months of preparation, then travel. Today, it requires Mondly VR and a VR headset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MondlyVR-for-Daydream-Learn-languages-in-Virtual-Reality-1_2.gif"                      alt="MondlyVR for Daydream Learn languages in Virtual Reality 1 2" title="Mondly Launches The First Vr Language App With Speech Recognition On Daydream 2"                ></p><h2 id="Experts-agree-that-IMMERSION-is-the-best-way-to-learn-a-new-language"><a href="#Experts-agree-that-IMMERSION-is-the-best-way-to-learn-a-new-language" class="headerlink" title="Experts agree that IMMERSION is the best way to learn a new language"></a>Experts agree that IMMERSION is the best way to learn a new language</h2><p>In one <a class="link"   href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/science/how-immersion-helps-to-learn-a-new-language.html?mcubz=1" >study <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  , featured in the New York Times by Michael Ullman, a neuroscientist at Georgetown University Medical Center, language learning subjects were split into two groups. One group studied language in a formal classroom setting, while the other was taught through immersion. After five months, both groups retained the language. However, the group that learned a new language through immersion displayed the full brain patterns of a native speaker.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a

Out of these, a third are now endangered. And out of this third, many have less than 1,000 speakers remaining. But what is the oldest of them? What are the oldest languages in the world? What did the first words our ancestors spoke sound like?</p><p> As new evidence resurfaces every day, we can’t yet know what’s the first language ever spoken. But linguists and historians agree that these are<strong>the oldest languages in the world:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Akkadian</strong></li><li><strong>Arabic</strong></li><li><strong>Aramaic</strong></li><li><strong>Chinese</strong></li><li><strong>Egyptian</strong></li><li><strong>Elamite</strong></li><li><strong>Greek</strong></li><li><strong>Hebrew</strong></li><li><strong>Hittite</strong></li><li><strong>Hurrian</strong></li><li><strong>Irish Gaelic</strong></li><li><strong>Latin</strong></li><li><strong>Mycenaean Greek</strong></li><li><strong>Palaic</strong></li><li><strong>Sanskrit</strong></li><li><strong>Sumerian</strong></li><li><strong>Tamil</strong></li></ul><p> Languages have always been fascinating because of the role they played as one of the pillars of civilization on Earth. Imagine a world where beings don’t communicate. What does that world look like? It’s unimaginable. Languages have shaped humanity for ages and continue to do so even today. They are fluid and in a continuous evolution. But their timeless metamorphosis makes it hard for historians and linguists to determine what are the oldest languages in the world.</p><h2 id="What-was-the-first-language-on-Earth"><a href="#What-was-the-first-language-on-Earth" class="headerlink" title="What was the first language on Earth?"></a>What was the first language on Earth?</h2><p> We only know what history tells us. And history says the first spoken language appeared 10,000 years ago. But we can never know for sure because no one was there to confirm. So there is only one way to judge the age of a language: by the earliest proof of its written form. However, this still remains guesswork, as it’s always possible that archaeologists might discover something new tomorrow. Something that could change history as we know it. Furthermore, these ancient languages were surely in use long before they were written in stone or on papyruses. But for how long? It remains a mystery.</p><p> Needless to say, the first human languages were likely simple, consisting of basic sounds and gestures used to communicate basic survival needs such as food, water, and shelter. Over time, these early languages evolved and diversified as human societies grew more complex and began to engage in trade, agriculture, and other activities.</p><p> While<strong>we may never know for sure what the first human language was,</strong> current research suggests that language has been a fundamental part of the human experience for thousands of generations and that it continues to evolve and adapt to our changing world.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/themes/mondly/img/mondly-banner-icon.png"                      alt="mondly banner icon" title="The First &Amp; Oldest Languages Ever Spoken: Origins Of Human Communication 2"                ></p><h5 id="Do-you-want-to-learn-some-of-the-oldest-languages-on-Earth"><a href="#Do-you-want-to-learn-some-of-the-oldest-languages-on-Earth" class="headerlink" title="Do you want to learn some of the oldest languages on Earth?"></a>Do you want to learn some of the oldest languages on Earth?</h5><p> Mondly offers courses in Greek, Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew and even Latin.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-4757&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-4757&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-4757&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-4757&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-4757&mt=8" >Start Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Ancient-languages-the-oldest-dead-languages-on-Earth"><a href="#Ancient-languages-the-oldest-dead-languages-on-Earth" class="headerlink" title="Ancient languages: the oldest dead languages on Earth"></a>Ancient languages: the oldest dead languages on Earth</h2><p><strong>Ancient languages</strong> typically refer to<strong>old extinct languages</strong> that no longer have any speakers.

Thus, given this evidence, Sumerian can also be considered<strong>the first language in the world</strong> or one of the ancient languages.</p><p> Sumerian was gradually replaced by Akkadian as a spoken language around 2000 BC, but it continued to be used as a literary, ceremonial, scientific and sacred language until the 1st century AD. Unknown to the modern world until the 19th century when Assyriologists began deciphering its cuneiform inscriptions, written Sumerian can be divided into several time periods: Archaic Sumerian (31st–26th century BC), Old or Classical Sumerian (26th–23rd century BC), Neo-Sumerian (23rd–21st century BC), Late Sumerian (20th–18th century BC) and Post-Sumerian (after 1700 BC).</p><p>Other ancient languages that are now extinct are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurrian%5Flanguage"><strong>Hurrian</strong></a> – oldest proof of written Hurrian dates back to the 21st century BC;</li><li><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Anatolian-languages/Palaic"><strong>Palaic</strong></a> – attested in cuneiform tablets in Bronze Age Hattusa – circa the 16th century BC;</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian%5Flanguage"><strong>Egyptian</strong></a> – its earliest known complete written sentence has been dated to about 2690 BC;</li><li><strong>Akkadian</strong> – first attested texts from around the mid-3rd-millennium BC;</li><li><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Elamite-language"><strong>Elamite</strong></a> – the earliest Elamite writings use a pictographic script and date from the middle of the 3rd millennium BC;</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anitta"><strong>Hittite</strong></a> – the oldest known text in the Hittite language was written by Anitta, a king that reigned in the 17th century BC;</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear%5FB"><strong>Mycenaean Greek</strong></a> – the most ancient attested form of the Greek language with the earliest writings dating back to 1450 BC.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100527/7443" target="_top" id="2100527">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100527" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100527/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="10-oldest-living-languages-in-the-world"><a href="#10-oldest-living-languages-in-the-world" class="headerlink" title="10 oldest living languages in the world"></a>10 oldest living languages in the world</h2><p> The same as everything else in the world, languages have a life cycle.

Thus, it’s debatable whether the Greek language we speak today is indeed 3400 years old or not. However, since its roots lie in Mycenaean Greek, we can all agree that Greek is indeed one of the oldest living languages in the world.</p><p> The Greek language holds an important place in history thanks to its rich literature that includes epic poems such as_Iliad_ and_Odyssey_ . Additionally, Greek is also the language in which many of the fundamental works in astronomy, mathematics, logic and philosophy (the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle) are composed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080312/19272" target="_top" id="2080312">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080312" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080312/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Coptic-Egyptian-cc-2200-years-old"><a href="#Coptic-Egyptian-cc-2200-years-old" class="headerlink" title="Coptic Egyptian (cc. 2200 years old)"></a>Coptic Egyptian (cc. 2200 years old)</h3><p><strong>First attested:</strong> 2nd century BC</p><p><strong>Spoken in:</strong> Egypt</p><p> <strong>Current number of <a class="link"   href="https://cambridgelibrarycollection.wordpress.com/2011/01/24/coptic-%E2%80%93-living-or-dead/" >speakers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> :</strong> unknown</p><p> Sometime in the 2nd century BC, Egyptian began to be written in the Coptic alphabet (an adaptation of the Greek alphabet), so the Coptic language can be considered the latest stage of the Egyptian language.</p><p> Unfortunately, the language will probably soon become extinct since there are only a few people left in the world who continue to <a class="link"   href="https://dailynewsegypt.com/2005/12/10/coptic-languages-last-survivors/" >use Coptic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as their day-to-day vernacular.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/first-language-960x640.jpg"                      alt="&#39;First language&#39; by NEOM©" title="The First &Amp; Oldest Languages Ever Spoken: Origins Of Human Communication 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880956/19272" target="_top" id="1880956">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880956" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880956/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Hebrew-cc-3000-years-old"><a href="#Hebrew-cc-3000-years-old" class="headerlink" title="Hebrew (cc. 3000 years old)"></a>Hebrew (cc. 3000 years old)</h3><p><strong>First attested:</strong> 10th century BCE</p><p><strong>Spoken in:</strong> Israel</p><p><strong>Current number of speakers:</strong> 9.3 million</p><p> The earliest known precursor to <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew%5Flanguage" >Hebrew <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the <a class="link"   href="https://dailynewsegypt.com/2005/12/10/coptic-languages-last-survivors/" >Khirbet Qeiyafa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> inscription in Ancient Hebrew discovered in 2007, near the Israeli city of Beit Shemesh, 30 km from Jerusalem.</p><p> The fascinating thing about <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Hebrew <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is that it had ceased to be an everyday spoken language somewhere between 200 and 400 AD.

However, with the discovery of Tolkāppiyam, the most ancient Tamil grammar text and the oldest surviving work of Tamil literature, scholars began to debate the true age of Tamil. The author of <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolk%C4%81ppiyam" >Tolkāppiyam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> often mentions “they say so” (or something similar) indicating a rich grammar and literature tradition even before him. Naturally, linguists began to wonder whether we should be dating the Tamil language at least a couple of thousand years before Tolkāppiyam.</p><p> Unfortunately, at the moment there is no archaeological evidence to support this claim, so experts stick to the original findings.</p><h3 id="Irish-Gaelic-1500-years-old"><a href="#Irish-Gaelic-1500-years-old" class="headerlink" title="Irish Gaelic (1500 years old)"></a>Irish Gaelic (1500 years old)</h3><p><strong>First attested:</strong> 4th century AD</p><p><strong>Spoken in:</strong> Ireland</p><p><strong>Current number of speakers:</strong> 1.2 million users</p><p> The earliest Irish Gaelic writings date to the 4th century AD, in the form of the linear Ogham scripts, in a stage of the language known as Primitive <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish%5Flanguage" >Irish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Then, Primitive Irish transitioned into Old Irish through the 5th century. During this time, the Irish language absorbed some Latin words and by the 10th century, it evolved once again into Middle Irish, which was spoken throughout Ireland and in Scotland and the Isle of Man.</p><p> Starting in the 12th century, Middle Irish began to develop into Modern Irish in Ireland, Scottish Gaelic in Scotland, and the Manx language in the Isle of Man. However, from the 18th century on, the language began to lose ground.
