    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Understanding-and-Using-Spanish-Verb-Endings"><a href="#Understanding-and-Using-Spanish-Verb-Endings" class="headerlink" title="Understanding and Using Spanish Verb Endings"></a>Understanding and Using Spanish Verb Endings</h2><p> ¡Hola, Spanish language aficionado! Welcome to another essential Spanish lesson you’ll have to learn if you want to boost your Spanish conversation skills. Today, we are talking about<strong>Spanish verbs</strong> , their conjugations, and some <a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875"><strong>Spanish grammar rules</strong></a> that will naturally join the party. Are you ready? Let’s start with the basics.</p><h2 id="Spanish-verbs-rules-for-regular-Spanish-verbs"><a href="#Spanish-verbs-rules-for-regular-Spanish-verbs" class="headerlink" title="Spanish verbs: rules for regular Spanish verbs"></a>Spanish verbs: rules for regular Spanish verbs</h2><p> Every language has its rules and Spanish makes no exception (wink). There’s nothing scary about a little grammar once in a while. The same as in English, the Spanish language has<strong>regular verbs</strong> that follow certain rules and<strong>irregular verbs</strong> that usually go wild and need to be learned by heart. Today, we are studying a few eloquent examples from both sides.</p><p> Now, here are a few rules you need to know about the<strong>Spanish regular verbs</strong> .</p><p> 1. There are three types of Spanish regular verbs. You’ll easily recognize them by their endings:<em>-ar</em> ,<em>-er</em> or_–ir_ . Think <em>brome<strong>ar</strong></em>  , <em>com<strong>er</strong></em>  , and <em>escrib<strong>ir</strong></em>  .<br> 2. Verbs ending in_-er_ and_-ir_ share almost the same conjugations. In other words, only two categories of verb endings will need your attention.<br> 3.

Well, there are tricks that you can use, but the truth is that, in time,<strong>irregular Spanish verbs</strong> will just… come to you. No joke. Once you get used to the language and use it all the time, your brain will start making connections.</p><p> As you already know,<strong>irregular verbs</strong> are “rebel” verbs that follow no regular set of rules. Statistically, in Spanish, almost all verbs ending in_-ar_ are regular, almost all verbs ending in_-er_ are irregular and less than half of all verbs ending in_-ir_ are irregular. So, let’s disentangle this complicated situation of<strong>irregular Spanish verbs</strong> and look for some patterns to help us learn faster.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137221/26400" target="_top" id="2137221">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137221" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137221/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Stem-Changing-Verbs-in-Spanish"><a href="#1-Stem-Changing-Verbs-in-Spanish" class="headerlink" title="1. Stem-Changing Verbs in Spanish"></a>1. Stem-Changing Verbs in Spanish</h3><p> The easiest type of<strong>irregular verbs in Spanish</strong> are the ones that require stem-changing but keep the regular endings. By the way, the stem of a verb is the result you get when you remove the infinitive suffix (meaning the_-ar_ ,<em>-er</em> , or_-ir_) from the infinitive form. For example, the stems of_deber_ ,<em>hablar</em> and_vivir_ are “deb-“, “habl-” and “viv-“.</p><p> As you noticed earlier in this article, when working with<strong>regular Spanish verbs</strong> , you never change the verb stem. You just remove the infinitive suffix and add the suitable ending. Irregular verbs, however, work differently. For some of them, you’ll need to change the stem and then add the ending. Let’s see an example of the verb_preferir_ (to prefer) :</p><ul><li><em>Yo prefie<strong>ro</strong></em></li><li><em>Tú prefie<strong>res</strong></em></li><li><em>Él &#x2F; Ella &#x2F; Usted prefie<strong>re</strong></em></li><li><em>Nosotros &#x2F;Nosotras prefe<strong>rimos</strong></em></li><li><em>Vosotros &#x2F; Vosotras prefe<strong>rís</strong></em></li><li><em>Ellos &#x2F; Ellas &#x2F; Ustedes prefie<strong>ren</strong></em></li></ul><p> Did you notice? For the_yo_ ,<em>tú</em> ,<em>él&#x2F;ella</em> and_ellos&#x2F;ellas_ forms the stem changes from “e” to “ie”.</p><p> Well, that is the first category of stem-changing verbs. Other examples of verbs include_empezar_ (to begin, to start),<em>negar</em> (to deny),<em>perder</em> (to lose),<em>sentir</em> (to feel),<em>suferir</em> (to suggest), etc.</p><p> The second category includes verbs that change the letter “o” to “ue”. Take_almorzar_ (to eat lunch) for example:</p><ul><li><em>Yo almue<strong>rzo</strong></em></li><li><em>Tú almue<strong>rzas</strong></em></li><li><em>Él &#x2F; Ella &#x2F; Usted almue<strong>rza</strong></em></li><li><em>Nosotros &#x2F;Nosotras almo<strong>rzamos</strong></em></li><li><em>Vosotros &#x2F; Vosotras almo<strong>rzáis</strong></em></li><li><em>Ellos &#x2F; Ellas &#x2F; Ustedes almue<strong>rzan</strong></em></li></ul><p><strong>Other similar verbs:</strong> <em>aprobar</em> (to aprove),<em>llover</em> (to rain),<em>demostrar</em> (to prove),<em>resolver</em> (to resolve),<em>volar</em> (to fly).</p><p> The third category includes verbs that change the letter “e” to “i”. Take_repetir_ (to repeat) for example:</p><ul><li><em>Yo repit<strong>o</strong></em></li><li><em>Tú repit<strong>es</strong></em></li><li><em>Él &#x2F; Ella &#x2F; Usted repit<strong>e</strong></em></li><li><em>Nosotros &#x2F;Nosotras repet<strong>imos</strong></em></li><li><em>Vosotros &#x2F; Vosotras repet<strong>ís</strong></em></li><li><em>Ellos &#x2F; Ellas &#x2F; Ustedes repit<strong>en</strong></em></li></ul><p><strong>Other similar verbs</strong> :<em>corregir</em> (to correct),<em>eligir</em> (to choose),<em>sonreír(se)</em> (to smile).</p><p> And finally, the fourth category includes some “rebel” stem-changing verbs that don’t fit into any of the mentioned categories.</p><p> The verb_oler_ (to smell), for example, is theoretically included in the second category (the one which transforms “o” to “ue”), but now, in addition to that, you also need to add an “h” to the beginning of the stem when the stem changes. Let’s see:</p><ul><li><em>Yo huel<strong>o</strong></em></li><li><em>Tú huel<strong>es</strong></em></li><li><em>Él &#x2F; Ella &#x2F; Usted huel<strong>e</strong></em></li><li><em>Nosotros &#x2F;Nosotras ol<strong>emos</strong></em></li><li><em>Vosotros &#x2F; Vosotras ol<strong>éis</strong></em></li><li><em>Ellos &#x2F; Ellas &#x2F; Ustedes huel<strong>en</strong></em></li></ul><p> Then there’s the verb_jugar_ (to play): the one and only example of a verb whose stem changes from “u” to a “ue”.</p><p><em>Adquirir</em> (to acquire) and_inquirir_ (to inquire) are just as rebellious because to the final letter “i” of their stem, we will need to add an “e”. Thus, “I acquire” will be “Yo adquiero”.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098703/14409" target="_top" id="2098703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098703/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Spanish-verbs-with-an-irregular-“yo”-form"><a href="#2-Spanish-verbs-with-an-irregular-“yo”-form" class="headerlink" title="2.

As such, HR professionals are increasingly turning to language training as a strategic investment to bolster their company’s intercultural competence. Not only does language training bridge linguistic gaps, but it also fosters a deeper understanding of international business practices and cultivates an environment of inclusivity.</p><p> With communication being pivotal, it’s time to explore how businesses can elevate their language education programs beyond mere vocabulary, pronunciation and grammar lessons. Here, we elucidate five actionable <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >tips that can make companies take corporate language training <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the next level.</p><h2 id="Tip-1-Adopt-Interactive-Learning-Methods"><a href="#Tip-1-Adopt-Interactive-Learning-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Adopt Interactive Learning Methods"></a>Tip 1: Adopt Interactive Learning Methods</h2><p> Language acquisition flourishes in environments that mirror real-world usage. To bring the business context alive, interactive learning methods must be integrated into your corporate language training courses and programs.</p><p> Role-playing exercises, where employees simulate common workplace scenarios, are highly effective. Furthermore, employing current events or creating bespoke scenarios closely related to the industry reinforces learning and its practical application.</p><p> Interactive learning goes beyond memorization; it enhances retention by providing an engaging, fun and memorable experience. With technology and e-learning platforms, these activities are not just achievable but can also be tailored to diverse learning paces and styles, ensuring an inclusive and effective training program for the benefit of all employees.</p><h3 id="The-Power-of-Role-Play"><a href="#The-Power-of-Role-Play" class="headerlink" title="The Power of Role-Play"></a>The Power of Role-Play</h3><p> Role-playing scenarios grant employees the opportunity to practice using a new language in a controlled environment. Employees and language learners can take on the role of a customer, a service provider, a salesperson or a manager,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >tackling varied language needs within the business <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> context.</p><h2 id="Tip-2-Emphasize-Cultural-Awareness"><a href="#Tip-2-Emphasize-Cultural-Awareness" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Emphasize Cultural Awareness"></a>Tip 2: Emphasize Cultural Awareness</h2><p> Language and culture are inseparable. Understanding cultural nuances is as crucial as the language itself when it comes to effective communication. Corporate language training courses must, therefore, incorporate cultural studies to equip employees with the tools they need to learn languages and communicate respectfully and effectively across borders.</p><p> An emphasis on cultural awareness prevents misunderstandings and miscommunications that may arise due to differing cultural norms, practices, languages and worldviews. By fostering a culture of appreciation and curiosity, businesses can position themselves to thrive in a globally connected economy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1834903">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834903.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1834903">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834903.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1834903%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1834903/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Nuances-and-Nuance-Training"><a href="#Nuances-and-Nuance-Training" class="headerlink" title="Nuances and Nuance Training"></a>Nuances and Nuance Training</h3><p> Cultural nuances are the subtle, often unspoken elements of how people speak and interact with each other. Nuance training is about teaching not just “what” to say, but “how” to say it in a culturally sensitive manner, helping avoid language-related faux pas that can tarnish a business’s reputation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2112007/7443" target="_top" id="2112007">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2112007" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2112007/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tip-3-Provide-Ongoing-Feedback"><a href="#Tip-3-Provide-Ongoing-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Provide Ongoing Feedback"></a>Tip 3: Provide Ongoing Feedback</h2><p> Constructive feedback is of course a linchpin of any successful learning endeavor. When it comes to language training, a supportive feedback loop encourages employees to push their boundaries and take more significant linguistic leaps. Positive reinforcement for progress made, accompanied by constructive criticism, ensures the continuous development of language skills.</p><p> Feedback should be timely, specific and actionable, focusing on both strengths and areas for improvement. This not only hones language skills but also nurtures an environment of continuous learning within the organization.</p><h3 id="The-Art-of-Feedback"><a href="#The-Art-of-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="The Art of Feedback"></a>The Art of Feedback</h3><p> Effective feedback is constructive, timely and specific. It should be delivered in a supportive, non-threatening manner, highlighting areas of growth and celebrating milestones achieved along the language-learning journey.</p><h2 id="Tip-4-Utilize-Technology-for-Language-Learning"><a href="#Tip-4-Utilize-Technology-for-Language-Learning" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Utilize Technology for Language Learning"></a>Tip 4: Utilize Technology for Language Learning</h2><p> The digital revolution has transformed the landscape of language learning.

Encouraging language immersion for employees, both within and outside the workplace, accelerates the learning process by granting them constant exposure to the language. This can be achieved in many aspects: through language exchange programs, cultural immersion experiences, group classes or even small daily practices like setting an English-only hour in the corporate environment.</p><p> Language immersion fosters confidence and comfort with speaking the language, indispensable elements for fluid and effective communication. It transforms language learning from an academic exercise to a natural and ongoing practice.</p><h3 id="Diving-In-Language-Exchange-and-More"><a href="#Diving-In-Language-Exchange-and-More" class="headerlink" title="Diving In: Language Exchange and More"></a>Diving In: Language Exchange and More</h3><p> Language exchange programs pair employees with native speakers of the language they wish to learn. It’s a mutually beneficial arrangement where both parties improve their language skills, while also gaining insights into aspects of each other’s culture, language level and way of life.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Effective communication is pivotal in fostering a collaborative, productive and successful business environment. Implementing robust and forward-thinking language training programs can catalyze this communication ability, unlocking new opportunities and markets for the organization.</p><p> By adopting interactive methods, emphasizing cultural awareness, providing continuous feedback, using curriculum development, utilizing the latest language learning technology, using customized programs and promoting language immersion,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >businesses can enhance their employees’ language skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and, by extension, their global reach and impact.</p><p> Language training in the corporate world is no longer just a tool for bridging communication gaps; it’s a strategic lever for achieving sustainable growth and competitive advantage.

The language spectrum is wider here, as opposed to Europe for example. The collection of Asian languages includes Sino -Tibetan, Austronesian, Dravidian, Altaic and countless others. By the way, English is also spoken fluently as a second language in many countries in Asia. So, if you’re planning a trip to Asia, or wishing to study there, it’s about time you found out which are the most popular Asian languages!</p><p> The list has been put together by looking at the most common languages spoken in Asia, but also the most popular Asian and Pacific Island languages popular in the US and Europe and the most popular Asian languages for business. How to learn Asian languages? <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-6345&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6345&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6345" >Mondly’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> got your back!</p><p> So, without further ado, let’s discover which are the most popular Asian languages today!</p><h2 id="1-Chinese-Mandarin"><a href="#1-Chinese-Mandarin" class="headerlink" title="1.

Mandarin is the most spoken dialect and China’s official language. It belongs to the Sino-Tibetan language family and is somewhat similar to Cantonese.</p><p> Other known dialects are Cantonese, Hokkien, Xiang, Hakka, Min, Wu, and Yue. You should know that the language has over 100.000 special characters, which are called logograms, and its speakers use four distinct tones to communicate. There is also a neutral tone and each one of the five is used in order to differentiate between words. At least, all the dialects use the same writing system, phew… Don’t worry, we’ll start you off with something easy like <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >“hello” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >“thank you” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Chinese is also the third most common foreign language in the United States, with approximately 3.4 million speakers. By the way, it’s very possible that China will become the strongest economy by 2050, so you’d better <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >start learning Chinese online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  soon.

This Indo-Aryan derived language is spoken by approximately 550 million people, including here the residents of Fiji. Written in the Devanagari script, Hindi is also spoken by some 81 million people in the US. If you are a fan of Bollywood, this is the language for you!</p><p> Coming from Sanskrit, Hindi is the fourth most-spoken native language in the world, behind Chinese, Spanish and English, and it’s also incredibly similar to Urdu. The two languages are so similar that two speakers of Urdu and Hindi can understand each other without issues! Even though it is the most popular language in India, it is not in fact the national language. This is due to the fact that the Indian constitution does not specify a national language as such. By the way, Hindi is also one of the easiest languages to learn by English speakers, so you should definitely give it a go!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135395/19272" target="_top" id="2135395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135395/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Indonesian"><a href="#3-Indonesian" class="headerlink" title="3.

To be more precise, Indonesian is actually considered a dialect of Malay, with differences mainly when it comes to accent and vocabulary.</p><p> However, natives can certainly distinguish between the two with ease. Good news for the language enthusiasts, Indonesian uses Latin script, which makes it one of the least challenging Asian languages to learn. Another interesting fact is that Indonesian is the third most used language in WordPress, with an astounding 1.5 million blogs written in this language.</p><p> With 240 million speakers in Asia alone, Indonesian is actually more popular than Korean (sorry <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Squid Game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  fans) or Japanese, even though it’s hard to believe.

It doesn’t matter if you have a tight budget, a busy work schedule, or your local coronavirus restrictions have shut down classes, you can still launch your language learning journey.</p><p> However, as with everything else in life and business, there’s a right way and a wrong way to learn a language online.

Find your ‘why’"></a>1. Find your ‘why’</h2><p> Every successful language learning mission should start with you identifying your ‘why’. So ask yourself, “Why do I want to learn a language online in 2023?”</p><p> Do you want to be able to communicate with clients from abroad in their mother tongue? Will you need to travel for your career in the future? Do you also want to learn a language for your personal interest, not just as part of a <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >corporate language learning <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> scheme?</p><p> When you take the time to understand why you want to learn a particular language, you’ll be more likely to succeed.

It’s better to be learning in short bursts every single day, even if you have to squeeze it into the ten minutes you have spare before you need to pick the children up from school.</p><p> By making language learning a regular habit, you’ll keep new words, phrases and grammatical structures fresh in your mind, you’ll notice more progress and you’ll find it much easier to stay motivated.</p><p> How much time you choose to spend each day is really up to you. For best results, experts recommend you do between 30-40 minutes per day so you can harness the power of <a class="link"   href="http://michaeldsimmons.com/why-constant-learners-all-embrace-the-5-hour-rule-mm09/" >The Five Hour Rule <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . As American business magazine and website <a class="link"   href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/317602" >Entrepreneur <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> says, “No matter how busy successful people are, they always spend at least an hour a day — or five hours a workweek — learning or practicing.”</p><p>Here are a few tips on how to stay consistent:</p><ol><li><strong>Habit stack.</strong> Connect your language learning with an existing habit and do them together. For example, work through your <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >daily Mondly language lesson <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> whilst you drink your lunchtime coffee, take public transport to work, or even right before you brush your teeth in the evening.</li><li><strong>Set a reminder.</strong> Set an alarm clock or enable Mondly notifications to remind you to learn your language.</li><li><strong>Don’t give up</strong> . Despite all our best efforts, life can sometimes get in the way. You might miss a lesson or two and although that’s not ideal, it’s OK. Just make sure you don’t get discouraged and get right back into practice again.</li><li><strong>Get an accountability partner.</strong> Why not get a friend or <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >colleague to study a foreign language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> too? You can keep each other motivated, help each other through struggles and make it much more likely that you’ll reach your language-learning goals.</li></ol><p><a class="link"   href="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/language-learning-app-960x761.png"  title="What&#39;S The Best Way To Learn A Language Online In 2023 2">language learning app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5581&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5581&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5581" >https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5581&amp;fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5581&amp;redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&amp;redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&amp;redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5581 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> Practice daily with Mondly</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1702748">                    <video width="192" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1702748.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1702748">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1702748.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:120px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftwopages.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1702748%2F18544'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702748/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Break-down-your-goal-micro-missions"><a href="#3-Break-down-your-goal-micro-missions" class="headerlink" title="3.

Break down your goal micro missions</h2><p> If you’ve ever visited websites like Fluent in Three Months or watched YouTube language videos, you probably think that you’ve failed if you aren’t fluent in your chosen language in weeks. The truth is, learning a language takes time – it’s a marathon, not a sprint.</p><p> That’s why it’s so important to treat your business language learning mission like any other project and break your overall goal down into clear micro missions. Depending on your needs or level of motivation, these can be weekly, monthly, quarterly or even for the next six months. By continually moving towards these goals and learning your language every day, you’ll get a great sense of achievement that will help your confidence to grow and keep you motivated.</p><p> What will your language learning goals be in 2023? To complete every daily language lesson on Mondly? To ace the weekly quiz? To succeed in the monthly challenge?

A single word is all you need to receive dozens of smiles. Greek people are known for their hospitality and good mood, but your attempt to speak Greek will multiply that by 100. <strong>A heartfelt_efcharistó_ (‘thanks’) can truly work wonders.</strong> But what are all the other ways to express gratitude in Greek depending on the context?</p><p> Even in English, there is more than one way to say ‘<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >thank you <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ’. It’s only natural to expect the same from Greek. It all depends on the context, who you are talking to, what are thanking them for and how well you know that person. It all seems so complicated now, but it won’t be once you read on.</p><p> In this quick Greek lesson, we’ll show you only the practical ways to say thank you in Greek. The thanks you’ll actually need and use in real life. Additionally, we’ll also go over how to say ‘please’ or ‘you’re welcome’ in Greek. As a result, you’ll know exactly what to say and when to say it.</p><h2 id="What-does-efcharisto-mean-in-Greek"><a href="#What-does-efcharisto-mean-in-Greek" class="headerlink" title="What does efcharistó mean in Greek?"></a>What does efcharistó mean in Greek?</h2><p> <strong>(Ευχαριστώ)<em>Efcharistó</em> is the most popular way to say ‘thank you’ in Greek.</strong> More similar to ‘thanks’ than ‘thank you’,<a href="https://greekerthanthegreeks.com/2015/12/lost-in-translationword-of-day.html"><em>efcharistó</em></a> is an informal way of expressing gratitude. Generally, it is most commonly used as a response to a small act of kindness or a basic courtesy from a friend, family member or colleague.</p><p> Additionally, if you feel like it’s appropriate, you can also use it to thank the friendly taverna keeper at the end of the night.</p><p> A funny but very good mnemonic for remembering how to say_efcharistó_ is to think of it as ‘ef-harry’s-toe’.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137204/26400" target="_top" id="2137204">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137204" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137204/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-informal-‘thank-you’-in-Greek"><a href="#The-informal-‘thank-you’-in-Greek" class="headerlink" title="The informal ‘thank you’ in Greek"></a>The informal ‘thank you’ in Greek</h2><p> It’s true that ευχαριστώ (<em>efcharistó</em> – ‘thanks’) is more than enough to ‘survive’ in <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Greece <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It’s not a Greek tragedy if your Greek vocabulary is not on point. Most Greek people speak English and won’t expect you to be fluent in Greek.</p><p> However, if you want to say more than just ‘thanks’, <strong>you can say σ’ ευχαριστώ_(s’ efcharistó)_ which is ‘thank you’ in Greek.</strong> Although informal_, s’ efcharistó_ is more similar to ‘thank you’ and can be used safely when giving thanks to friends or colleagues.</p><p> If you are especially thankful to them, you can also say ευχαριστώ πολύ_(efcharistó poli)_ which means ‘thanks a lot’. Or even ευχαριστώ πάρα πολύ_(efcharistó para poli)_ meaning ‘thank you very much’.</p><h2 id="The-formal-‘thank-you’-in-Greek"><a href="#The-formal-‘thank-you’-in-Greek" class="headerlink" title="The formal ‘thank you’ in Greek"></a>The formal ‘thank you’ in Greek</h2><p> When it comes to formality, everything you have to do is to switch to the plural form. If you are talking to someone older, someone you don’t know or maybe even a group of people, you can say <strong>σας ευχαριστώ_(sas efcharistó)_ .</strong> Since English doesn’t have any formal pronouns, there’s no easy way to literally translate this, but it would mean something along the lines of “thank you to all of you”.</p><p> Similarly, ευχαριστώ πολύ (efcharistó poli) becomes σας ευχαριστώ πολύ_(sas efcharistó poli)_ and ευχαριστώ πάρα πολύ (efcharistó para poli) becomes σας ευχαριστώ πάρα πολύ_(sas efcharistó para poli)._</p><p> Easy enough, isn’t it? Once you know all the informal, singular ‘thanks’, all you have to do to make them formal is to add the polite plural σας_(sas)_ in front of them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/thanks-in-greek-960x720.jpg"                      alt="taverna in Greece" title="All The Best Ways To Say Thank You In Greek 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1484963">                    <video width="864" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1484963.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484963">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1484963.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1484963%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484963/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> “Mýkonos, Greece” by Johnny Chen©</p><h2 id="Examples-of-Greek-thanks"><a href="#Examples-of-Greek-thanks" class="headerlink" title="Examples of Greek thanks"></a>Examples of Greek thanks</h2><p> Now you know the best ways to say thank you in Greek.

Well, the key is to remember not to exaggerate. Excessive use of politeness can be seen as either weird or mocking especially in Athens, where the basic interaction and attitude resembles that of metropolises like New York or London.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Language-Acquisition-Quest"><a href="#Language-Acquisition-Quest" class="headerlink" title="Language Acquisition Quest"></a>Language Acquisition Quest</h2><p> It’s that time of the year again! No, not Christmas. Fast-forward a bit. I’m talking about that time of the year when you make unrealistic New Year’s resolutions – like <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learning a new language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – that won’t probably make it to the end of January. You know it. I know it. Let’s be honest. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t focus on personal growth and make a list of resolutions for the upcoming year. Whether it’s language learning or getting in shape, New Year’s resolutions can become a reality with good planning and SMART goals.</p><p> Many of us give up early on our New Year’s resolutions because we’re busy and demoralized. We’re only humans, after all. Still, this can change. So, let’s see how you can take up language learning in the new year and keep doing it until December.</p><h2 id="What-Are-New-Year’s-Resolutions"><a href="#What-Are-New-Year’s-Resolutions" class="headerlink" title="What Are New Year’s Resolutions?"></a>What Are New Year’s Resolutions?</h2><p> <strong>New Year’s resolutions are personal promises or goals people set for themselves as they embark on a new year.</strong> These resolutions often focus on self-improvement, lifestyle changes, or achieving specific objectives. The tradition of making New Year’s resolutions dates back centuries and is a common practice in many cultures around the world. Many take advantage of the clean slate – meaning the new year – to quit bad habits or maybe learn something new.</p><p> The practice is rooted in looking back on the previous year, identifying areas for improvement, and making a promise to yourself to begin your personal growth journey on the first day of the new year.</p><p> The success of New Year’s resolutions varies greatly. For some, they serve as a beneficial source of motivation for instigating positive transformations, while others may encounter difficulties maintaining their resolutions over the long term. The key to successful New Year’s resolutions often lies in setting realistic, specific, and achievable goals, accompanied by a well-structured plan to follow through on them.</p><h2 id="SMART-Goals-for-Language-Learning"><a href="#SMART-Goals-for-Language-Learning" class="headerlink" title="SMART Goals for Language Learning"></a>SMART Goals for Language Learning</h2><p> Our biggest problem when setting New Year’s resolutions is our apparent inability to regard each resolution as a<strong>SMART goal</strong> (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). For example, a faulty resolution could be “I want to learn a new language this year”. That’s not enough to motivate you.</p><p> However, if you change it into a SMART goal, everything changes: “I want to speak conversational Thai by the end of December because I want to travel to Thailand next year”. You can already see it becoming a reality, right?</p><p> But wait! Now, instead of imagining how accomplished you are going to feel when you reach that certain goal, you should envision the process towards it and enjoy every second of it. Otherwise, you will just end up procrastinating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/language-learning-2024-600x600.png"                      alt="language learning 2024" title="New Year, New Language: Your New Year Aspirations 5"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118311/7443" target="_top" id="2118311">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118311" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118311/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="A-SMART-Goal-is"><a href="#A-SMART-Goal-is" class="headerlink" title="A SMART Goal is"></a>A SMART Goal is</h4><ul><li><strong>Specific:</strong> Choose a language and define what fluency or proficiency means to you. For instance, “I want to achieve conversational fluency in Spanish”.</li><li><strong>Measurable:</strong> Track your progress and set milestones, like completing a language course or holding a 15-minute conversation in the target language.</li><li><strong>Achievable:</strong> Make sure your goal aligns with your current lifestyle. If you’re new to language learning, aim for basic proficiency before advancing to more complex goals.</li><li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Pick a language that resonates with your personal or professional life. Learning Japanese might be perfect if you love the Japanese culture or plan a trip to Japan, but Chinese is probably better for career opportunities.</li><li><strong>Time-Bound:</strong> Set a clear deadline. For example, “I will reach B1 level in French by the end of this year”.</li></ul><p> Studies show that breaking down your SMART goals into even smaller steps, like learning 1,000 French words by March, further boosts motivation and reward. Achieving this will let you understand 75% of written French without a dictionary. Moreover, involving a friend enhances motivation through competition, unlike sharing goals on social media. According to a <a class="link"   href="https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/peter-m-gollwitzer.html/09%5FGollwitzer%5FSheeran%5FSeifert%5FMichalski%5FWhen%5FIntentions%5F.pdf" >2019 research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , public goal-sharing may diminish determination, as early social recognition acts as a premature reward. In contrast, friendly competition in learning a language or losing weight can spur your competitive spirit, with the reward being your improvement.</p><h2 id="The-Mental-Health-Benefits-of-Language-Learning"><a href="#The-Mental-Health-Benefits-of-Language-Learning" class="headerlink" title="The Mental Health Benefits of Language Learning"></a>The Mental Health Benefits of Language Learning</h2><p> Why should learning a new language be included in your New Year’s resolutions list? Because language learning is <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >good for your brain <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . According to multiple studies, the benefits for your cognitive health and well-being are undeniable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902294/19272" target="_top" id="1902294">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902294" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902294/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Cognitive-Benefits"><a href="#Cognitive-Benefits" class="headerlink" title="Cognitive Benefits"></a>Cognitive Benefits</h3><p> Your brain is like a muscle: train it now, and you will enjoy the health benefits later. And learning a second or a third language is a great way of training your brain – especially if you are not a student anymore and the information flow is not as good as it used to be. More precisely, various studies have shown that learning a new language is directly linked to a slower rate of mental decline in patients with <a class="link"   href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5363123/Learning-language-protect-ALZHEIMERS.html" >Alzheimer’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> disease and <a class="link"   href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/12156709/Students-should-learn-second-language-to-prevent-dementia-in-later-life.html" >dementia prevention <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Moreover, language learning will give a great boost to your memory. In fact, it can increase the size of your brain! This is what <a class="link"   href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/sep/04/what-happens-to-the-brain-language-learning" >Swedish scientists discovered <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when they used brain scans to monitor what happens when someone learns a second language.</p><h3 id="Mental-Well-Being-Benefits"><a href="#Mental-Well-Being-Benefits" class="headerlink" title="Mental Well-Being Benefits"></a>Mental Well-Being Benefits</h3><p> The third millennium is governed by stress, depression, sleep deprivation and lack of empathy from those around you. Learning a language can be a fulfilling endeavor that boosts self-esteem, reduces stress, and provides a sense of achievement. So, why not give your brain something to be happy about? Learn Spanish. Learn German. Or maybe learn Japanese.

If you don’t choose language learning as a resolution for its cognitive benefits, you’ll surely choose it for its economic advantages.</p><ul><li><strong>Career opportunities:</strong> Being bilingual or multilingual can open doors to new job opportunities, especially in global or multicultural companies. Multilingual individuals can communicate effectively with a broader range of clients, partners, and customers, potentially leading to increased business success.</li><li><strong>Freelancing prospects:</strong> Learning a new language can lead to freelance opportunities, like translation or tutoring, adding an extra income stream.</li><li><strong>Salary boost:</strong> In some cases, people who speak more than one language may receive higher salaries than their monolingual counterparts. Certain industries, like finance, law, and technology, highly value language proficiency and are willing to compensate employees accordingly.</li><li><strong>Easier business travel:</strong> Language proficiency enables professionals to communicate effectively and build stronger relationships with their local partners and clients and better navigate unfamiliar environments.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/personal-growth-960x704.jpg"                      alt="personal growth" title="New Year, New Language: Your New Year Aspirations 7"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047346/19272" target="_top" id="2047346">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047346" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047346/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Top-5-To-Do’s-for-Learning-a-New-Language"><a href="#Top-5-To-Do’s-for-Learning-a-New-Language" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 To-Do’s for Learning a New Language"></a>Top 5 To-Do’s for Learning a New Language</h2><p><strong>1. Set Achievable Daily Goals:</strong> Establish a routine for language practice and break down your overall SMART goal into smaller, daily goals. This will help you get your rewards sooner and keep yourself motivated.</p><p><strong>2. Engage Regularly with Interactive Lessons:</strong> Another great motivator is interactive lessons and exercises. Your best bet in this situation is language learning apps, such as Mondly, that keep learning fun and engaging every single day.</p><p><strong>3. Practice Speaking and Listening:</strong> Focus on conversational practice and improving listening skills – especially if your final goal is to become fluent.</p><p><strong>4. Track and Review Your Progress:</strong> Monitor your learning journey and adjust your strategies as needed. Besides, the simple act of crossing things off of your to-do list is an amazing energy boost for your brain. As soon as you’ll achieve some of the mini-resolutions, you’ll feel more confident and determined to continue your journey.</p><p><strong>5. Participate in Community Challenges or Forums:</strong> Engaging with other learners will not only make you feel understood, but it will also boost your motivation. Studies have shown that comparing results with your peers will help you activate your competitive spirit.</p><p> Embarking on the journey of learning a new language as a New Year’s resolution is a path filled with many benefits. While the process may seem daunting at first, adopting a SMART goal approach—making them Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound—can significantly enhance the chances of success.</p><p> Here’s to embracing the linguistic journey and making the New Year truly transformative! 🥂</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/new-years-resolutions/&t=New+Year,+New+Language:+Your+New+Year+Aspirations"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080317/19272" target="_top" id="2080317">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080317" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080317/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="New-Year-New-Language"><a href="#New-Year-New-Language" class="headerlink" title="New Year, New Language"></a>New Year, New Language</h2><p> The time to start learning a new language is now.

French books for beginners are a great way to get used to the language, learn new French words and start to regard the language as if it were your mother tongue. Not into reading? Fear not. Reading in French is just as effective for your vocabulary, even if you read just short stories or comic books.</p><h2 id="The-Best-French-Novels-for-Beginners"><a href="#The-Best-French-Novels-for-Beginners" class="headerlink" title="The Best French Novels for Beginners"></a>The Best French Novels for Beginners</h2><ol><li><em>Le Petit Prince</em> (The Little Prince) by Antoine de Saint Exupéry</li><li><em>Le Petit Nicolas</em> (Little Nicholas) by René Goscinny</li><li><em>L’Étranger</em> (The Stranger) by Albert Camus</li><li><em>Oscar et la dame rose</em> (Oscar and the Lady in Pink) by Éric-Emmanuel Schmitt</li><li><em>Astérix le Gaulois</em> (Astérix le Gaulois) by René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo</li><li><em>Les Aventures de Tintin</em> (The Adventures of Tintin) by Hergé</li><li><em>Arsène Lupin, Gentleman-Cambrioleur</em> (Arsène Lupin, Gentleman Thief) by Maurice Leblanc</li><li><em>Bonjour Tristesse</em> (Hello Sadness) by Françoise Sagan</li><li><em>Le Château de ma mère</em> (My Mother’s Castle) by Marcel Pagnol</li><li><em>Les Misérables</em> (The Miserables) by Victor Hugo</li><li><em>Vingt Mille Lieues sous les mers</em> (Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas) by Jules Verne</li><li><em>Le scaphandre et le papillon</em> (The Diving Bell and the Butterfly) by Jean-Dominique Bauby</li><li><em>Les Trois Mousquetaires</em>  (The Three Musketeers) by Alexandre Dumas</li><li><em>Le Rouge et le Noir</em>  (The Red and the Black) by Stendhal</li><li><em>Madame Bovary</em>  by Gustave Flaubert</li><li><em>Le Comte de Monte-Cristo</em> (The Count of Monte Cristo) by Alexandre Dumas</li></ol><p> If you’re a<strong>beginner eager to read in French,</strong> it’s best to start with the first book on this list of French novels and then progressively work your way through. This approach ensures that as the texts become more complex, your French reading skills will improve accordingly. As a special highlight, the final recommendations are French classics books that everyone should read in their lifetime.</p><p> Naturally, this list is exclusively dedicated to books originally written in French, because reading them in the original language ensures you experience the full depth and nuances, which can sometimes be lost in translation. However, if we’re talking about a very good translation, you can definitely also<strong>read French translations of foreign books.</strong> For instance, after you’ve tackled the first six books on our list, I highly recommend <strong>reading_Harry Potter_ in French.</strong> Targeted at young readers, the initial books in the series are perfectly suited for beginners.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/book-in-french-960x640.jpg"                      alt="book in French" title="30+ Best French Books To Read In French 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1531879">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1531879">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1531879%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1531879/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Choose-the-Best-French-Books-for-New-Learners"><a href="#How-to-Choose-the-Best-French-Books-for-New-Learners" class="headerlink" title="How to Choose the Best French Books for New Learners"></a>How to Choose the Best French Books for New Learners</h2><p><strong>The best French novels for new learners</strong> are ones you’ve already read. No, really. Take it from me—a language learner at heart. I perfected my English, Spanish, and French by reading books, and I strongly recommend you do the same to improve your French.</p><p><strong>Reading in French,</strong> if your French is not that good,<strong>can be challenging</strong> at first. That’s why I always suggest starting with a book you have already read in your native language. It could be your favorite book or simply one you want to experience again. Being familiar with the story can significantly ease your first foray into reading a book in French.</p><p> As you progress through the pages, you’ll notice a gradual increase in your familiarity with French. You’ll start to deduce the meanings of unknown words from the context and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn French <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in a natural way. Even better, if you read an<strong>eBook in French</strong> on a Kindle, you can leverage the dictionary feature to learn new words simply by tapping on them.</p><p> After finishing, you can move on to a book you’ve never read before—in any language. However, depending on your French level, I’d suggest opting for a French novel for beginners, like_Le Petit Prince_ (The Little Prince), which is technically a novella.</p><p> Let’s recap.<strong>This is how to start reading in French:</strong></p><ol><li>Read your favorite book first (or just a book you read before) as it will help you get used to reading in French;</li><li>Continue with a short and accessible book that uses simpler language – like <em>Le Petit Prince</em> (The Little Prince);</li><li>Repeat the first two steps with different books if reading in French doesn’t feel like home yet;</li><li>Go on with more complex books, but don’t jump straight to French philosophy! Easy does it.</li></ol><p><strong>The secret to choosing the best books to read in French</strong> is to proceed step by step. Begin with shorter, simpler books that use straightforward language, and gradually progress to longer and more complex French books. Throughout this journey, avoid putting pressure on yourself. Reading should be enjoyable, especially when you pick genres that you love. So, make the most of your French reading experience — it will significantly benefit your French studies!</p><h2 id="Top-French-Authors-You-Should-Know"><a href="#Top-French-Authors-You-Should-Know" class="headerlink" title="Top French Authors You Should Know"></a>Top French Authors You Should Know</h2><ul><li>Victor Hugo</li><li>Alexandre Dumas</li><li>Jules Verne</li><li>Gustave Flaubert</li><li>George Sand</li><li>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</li><li>Guy de Maupassant</li><li>Voltaire</li><li>Albert Camus</li><li>Marcel Proust</li><li>Molière</li><li>Jean-Paul Sartre</li><li>Émile Zola</li><li>Stendhal</li><li>Honoré de Balzac</li></ul><p> The history of French literature is rich and extensive. Some of the<strong>world’s most celebrated authors are French,</strong> and you can discover them in this list of top French authors that everyone should know. However, if you want to learn to read French, it’s important to approach it step by step. If you’re just starting out, avoid diving straight into the complex works of Émile Zola or Jean-Paul Sartre. Instead, start with more accessible authors like Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and Victor Hugo. You might not be ready to tackle the<strong>greatest French novels</strong> from day one, but with enough work and patience, you’ll eventually get there.</p><p>Loading poll …</p><p>Coming Soon</p><p> Who’s your favorite French author?</p><p> Victor Hugo  Victor Hugo0 (0 %)</p><p> Alexandre Dumas  Alexandre Dumas1 (20 %)</p><p> Jules Verne  Jules Verne4 (80 %)</p><p> Albert Camus  Albert Camus0 (0 %)</p><p> Gustave Flaubert  Gustave Flaubert0 (0 %)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037318/7443" target="_top" id="2037318">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037318" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037318/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Romance-French-Novels-for-Incurable-Romantics"><a href="#Romance-French-Novels-for-Incurable-Romantics" class="headerlink" title="Romance French Novels for Incurable Romantics"></a>Romance French Novels for Incurable Romantics</h2><ul><li><em>L’amant</em> (The Lover) by Marguerite Duras</li><li><em>La Dame aux Camélias</em> (The Lady of the Camellias) by Alexandre Dumas fils</li><li><em>Les Liaisons dangereuses</em> (Dangerous Liaisons) by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos</li><li><em>Chéri</em>  by Colette</li><li><em>Bonjour Tristesse</em> (Hello Sadness) by Françoise Sagan</li><li><em>Notre-Dame de Paris</em> (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame) by Victor Hugo</li><li><em>Un long dimanche de fiançailles</em> (A very long engagement) by Sebastien Japrisot</li><li><em>Suite française</em> by Irène Némorovsky</li><li><em>Le Grandes Meaulnes</em>  by Alain-Fournier</li></ul><p> My number one rule for reading in French as a beginner is simple: read what you love. If that means diving into<strong>French romance novels,</strong> then embrace it! When you’re starting to read in French, there’s no such thing as a ‘bad’ book genre.</p><p> Think about the types of books you enjoy in your native language. If history books aren’t your thing in English, chances are you won’t suddenly find a passion for them in French.</p><p> Let’s be honest—everyone enjoys a captivating romance novel now and then. The fact that it’s in French only adds to the charm, making it a delightful bonus on your journey to learning French!</p><h2 id="Best-French-Short-Stories-for-Bite-Sized-Reading"><a href="#Best-French-Short-Stories-for-Bite-Sized-Reading" class="headerlink" title="Best French Short Stories for Bite-Sized Reading"></a>Best French Short Stories for Bite-Sized Reading</h2><ol><li><em>Short Stories in French for Beginners</em>  by Olly Richards and Richard Simcott</li><li><em>Les Contes de la rue Broca</em> (The Stories of Broca Street) by Pierre Gripari</li><li><em>Les Contes de ma mère l’Oye</em> (Tales of Mother Goose) by Charles Perrault</li><li><em>Contes de la bécasse</em> (Tales of the woodcock) by Guy de Maupassant</li><li><em>Contes du jour et de la nuit</em> (Tales of Day and Night) Guy de Maupassant</li><li><em>La Cafetière et Autres Contes Fantastiques</em> (The Coffee Pot and Other Fantastic Tales) by Théophile Gautier</li><li><em>Les Diaboliques</em> (The Diabolicals) by Barbey d’Aurevilly</li><li><em>Voyage à Marseille</em> (Voyage to Marseille) by Sylvie Lainé</li><li><em>Short Stories in French: New Penguin Parallel Text</em> edited by Richard Coward</li></ol><p> We mentioned we would discuss short stories, didn’t we?

With the first grammar of the language appearing in the 18th century, the literary Latvian language developed over the course of the 19th century. Then, in 1922, a modified Latin alphabet was adopted.</p><p> The Latvian standard alphabet we use today consists of 33 letters: 22 unmodified letters of the Latin alphabet (all except q, w, x and y) and other eleven modified letters (ā, ē, ī, ū, č, š, ž, ģ, ķ, ļ, ņ).</p><p> When it comes to Latvian grammar, the most important aspects you should know are that primary word stress is on the first syllable (with a few exceptions), word order is relatively free (but the unmarked order is subject–verb–object) and that there are no articles in Latvian and definiteness is expressed by the adjective’s ending.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/latvian-language-course-277x600.jpg"                      alt="latvian language course" title="Learn Latvian Online In Just 10 Minutes A Day 2"                ></p><p> Learn Latvian with Mondly</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-similar-are-Latvian-and-Lithuanian"><a href="#How-similar-are-Latvian-and-Lithuanian" class="headerlink" title="How similar are Latvian and Lithuanian?"></a>How similar are Latvian and Lithuanian?</h2><p> As a Baltic language, Latvian is most closely related to sister language <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Lithuanian <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Linguists even claim that, for quite some time, <strong>Latvian and Lithuanian were different dialects of the same language.</strong> However, Latvian has followed a more rapid development that made the two contemporary languages rather different.</p><p> Unsurprisingly, Latvian and Lithuanian do share a lot of features, but they are not mutually intelligible enough to make conversation possible.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137210/26400" target="_top" id="2137210">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137210" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137210/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-similar-are-Latvian-and-Russian"><a href="#How-similar-are-Latvian-and-Russian" class="headerlink" title="How similar are Latvian and Russian?"></a>How similar are Latvian and Russian?</h2><p> These days you can’t talk about the Latvian language if you don’t mention <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Russian <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well.</p><p><strong>Latvia has long historic ties with Russia:</strong> both during tsarist times – when Latvia was a part of the Russian Empire – and the Soviet occupation in the second half of the 20th century, when the Russification policy greatly affected the Latvian language and Russians have immigrated into Latvia without learning Latvian.</p><p> Today, more than a quarter of <a class="link"   href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43626368" >Latvia’s 2.2 million people are ethnic Russians <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , most of whom are taught in Russian. However, the only official language is Latvian.</p><p> So how similar are Latvian and Russian? Well, in terms of grammar, they share some resembling features, but the phonology is quite different. While Latvian focuses on long vowels and diphthongs, Russian uses softened consonants. Of course, Latvian does have consonants, but they are pronounced differently. Take for example the Russian “n” which is dental and alveolar and Latvian “n” which is palatal and velar.</p><p> When it comes to vocabulary, it’s been said that it is sometimes easy for Russian people to understand Latvian words. However, most of the time, these words are either borrowings from a third language or a similarity coming from the proto-language.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/learn-latvian-online/&t=Learn+Latvian+Online+in+Just+10+Minutes+a+Day"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2005183/22899" target="_top" id="2005183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2005183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2005183/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Speak-Latvian-today"><a href="#Speak-Latvian-today" class="headerlink" title="Speak Latvian today"></a>Speak Latvian today</h2><p> It can be really tricky to master Latvian pronunciation if you don’t actively live in Latvia.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Grecian-Lexicon-Historical-Journey-Modern-Day-Importance"><a href="#Grecian-Lexicon-Historical-Journey-Modern-Day-Importance" class="headerlink" title="Grecian Lexicon: Historical Journey &amp; Modern Day Importance"></a>Grecian Lexicon: Historical Journey &amp; Modern Day Importance</h2><p> In the fascinating world of historical linguistics, the ancient Greek language is like a powerful god, casting long and tangled beams of influence toward modern languages and beyond. And that’s only natural. <strong>Humanity’s most foundational knowledge was first articulated in the ancient Greek language.</strong> Whether we’re talking about Plato’s dialogues, Homer’s_Iliad_ , or the forward-looking explorations in science, astronomy, and mathematics, we owe a lot to ancient Greece and its language.</p><p> So, let’s embark on a journey through time and explore the history of the ancient Greek language. We will look at its profound impact on modern languages and culture and how it differs from modern Greek. With a little help from the Greek gods and goddesses, you’ll see that ancient Greek is not a relic of the past but a living legacy echoing everywhere in the modern world.</p><p> Men think about the Roman Empire a lot, but I believe ancient Greece is just as fascinating. What do you think?</p><h2 id="Ancient-Greek-Language-–-Historical-Journey"><a href="#Ancient-Greek-Language-–-Historical-Journey" class="headerlink" title="Ancient Greek Language – Historical Journey"></a>Ancient Greek Language – Historical Journey</h2><p> Stretching over millennia, <strong>the historical journey of the ancient Greek language can be considered as epic as Homer’s_Odyssey_ .</strong> Spoken by some of the most influential people in human history, ancient Greek has known the world in a way we never will.</p><p> But before going over its tale, a clarification needs to be made. When we say “ancient Greek”, most think of the language spoken before our era. However, what we call “ancient Greek” is actually just a phase in the evolution of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Greek-language" >Greek language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The periods in which the Greek language was divided are:</p><ul><li><strong>Proto-Greek:</strong> This is the earliest form of Greek that was not directly attested but inferred.</li><li><strong>Mycenaean Greek:</strong> Dating from the 16th to 12th centuries BC, it’s the most ancient attested form of Greek.</li><li><strong>Ancient Greek:</strong> Used during the “Dark Ages” and Classical periods (1200-300 BC), this version of Greek was spoken widely across regions and was used in literature and philosophy.</li><li><strong>Hellenistic Greek (Koine):</strong> A common dialect that evolved following Alexander the Great’s conquests.

Despite the abandonment of the standardized Mycenaean language, local vernacular dialects persisted and evolved into various Greek dialects over time.</p><p> These dialects were significantly influenced by social interactions, economic activities, tribal mixings, and conflicts, leading to a collective linguistic and cultural consciousness among the Greek people. Ancient Greek dialects heavily influenced the era’s literature, with each piece closely tied to a specific dialect that reflected the Greek tribe and its unique socio-economic contexts.</p><p> Ancient Greek writing during this archaic period featured the “Boustrophedon” style (literally “ox-turning”, after the manner of an ox plowing a field), where alternate lines of text were reversed, a technique observed in earlier civilizations. Nevertheless, around the 8th century BC, the Greek alphabet was standardized.</p><h3 id="Dialects-of-Ancient-Greece"><a href="#Dialects-of-Ancient-Greece" class="headerlink" title="Dialects of Ancient Greece"></a>Dialects of Ancient Greece</h3><p> <strong>Before the conquest by the Macedonians in the late 4th century BCE, there was no unified Greek language;</strong> rather, various competing dialects existed. Each city or region had its standard for inscriptions, and though these dialects were diverse, the Greeks had a concept of a shared linguistic identity and could understand other dialects.</p><p> These dialects, including Attic and Ionic, Aeolic, Arcadocypriot, and Doric, with sub-dialects like Macedonian Greek, resulted from the Greek tribes’ geographic dispersion, varied settlement locations, and political autonomy.</p><p> Naturally, this complex linguistic landscape, characterized by many dialects and writing styles, highlights nothing more than the rich diversity and evolution of the ancient Greek language.</p><h3 id="Iconic-texts-written-in-the-ancient-Greek-language"><a href="#Iconic-texts-written-in-the-ancient-Greek-language" class="headerlink" title="Iconic texts written in the ancient Greek language"></a>Iconic texts written in the ancient Greek language</h3><p> <strong>The most important pieces of writing we have from this period are the Homeric Poems:<em>The Iliad</em> and_The Odyssey_ .</strong> The two epic poems are foundational to Greek education and culture and remain pivotal works in European literary tradition.<em>The Iliad</em> narrates the rage of Achilles during the Trojan War, while_The Odyssey_ follows Odysseus’s journey home after the war. Over time, the composition methods of these epics have been a subject of extensive debate between experts.</p><p>Other literary works of art representative of this period include:</p><ul><li><strong>Plato’s Dialogues</strong></li><li><strong>Sappho’s poems</strong></li><li><strong>Herodotus’ Histories</strong></li><li><strong>Euripides’ tragedies</strong></li><li><strong>Aesop’s fables</strong></li><li><strong>Sophocles’ tragedies</strong></li></ul><p> Many of these names seem familiar because their works were so forward-looking they are still relevant today.

Used for approximately 2,800 years to this day, it is the earliest known alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels and consonants. Greeks adopted and adapted it from the earlier Phoenician alphabet.</p><p> However, the earliest attested form of the Greek language is a clay tablet written in the Linear B script. Historians claim that it dates to between 1450 and 1350 BC. Unrelated to the Greek alphabet, which emerged around the 8th century BC, Linear B last appeared in the 13th century BC. The centuries between the two writing scripts, where no Greek writings have been found, is referred to as the Greek Dark Ages.</p><h2 id="Cultural-Influences-of-Ancient-Greek-on-the-Western-Civilization"><a href="#Cultural-Influences-of-Ancient-Greek-on-the-Western-Civilization" class="headerlink" title="Cultural Influences of Ancient Greek on the Western Civilization"></a>Cultural Influences of Ancient Greek on the Western Civilization</h2><p> Ancient Greece’s influence on Western civilization is undeniable, and you’ll soon see why. For example, where do you think the Olympic Games came from? Or where did democracy originate? They’re both products of Ancient Greece, of course!</p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Greece/The-Olympic-Games" >The Ancient Olympic Games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> were held at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece,</strong> every four years. Unsurprisingly, the origins of the Ancient Olympics are rooted in myth and legend, notably involving Hercules and Zeus. It’s believed Hercules (or Heracles) named the Games ‘Olympic’ and introduced the tradition of hosting them every four years. After finishing his twelve labors, Hercules supposedly built the Olympic Stadium to honor Zeus. He then marked a distance called “stadion” after walking 200 steps, which became a unit of measurement.</p><p> We can’t know how much of this is true. But one thing we know for sure: <strong>inscriptions at Olympia place the inception of the Ancient Olympics in 776 BC.</strong> Apparently, they reached their peak somewhere between the 6th and 5th centuries BCE and then slowly declined in significance as the Romans gained influence in Greece.</p><p> From politics and governance to philosophy and science, Greek terminologies and ideas laid the foundations for Western thought. Words like ‘democracy’, ‘philosophy’, and ‘astronomy’ are testimonials of Ancient Greek’s influence on today’s world.

More precisely, <strong>the ideas laid out in Aristotle’s_Politics_ have become integral to how modern societies practice democracy.</strong></p><p> At the same time, the ideas of these influential thinkers on logic, ethics, and metaphysics also continue to influence contemporary philosophical debates and guide our exploration of fundamental questions about existence, morality, and the nature of reality. Their brilliant minds concocted theses that are still relevant millennia later. Isn’t it mind-blowing?</p><p> If you had any doubts about ancient Greece’s influence, know that the word ‘philosophy’ itself is of Greek origin.

The epic tales of gods, goddesses, demigods, and heroes have inspired numerous artists, writers, and thinkers to create their next big work of art. If you look into it, you’ll see that the influence of Greek myths can still be found everywhere, from literature and sculpture to popular culture and advertising.</p><p> At the same time, the ancient Greek epics and plays are also foundational for Western literature. Some of the most popular tragedies and comedies in history are still those of ancient Greece. Examples include<strong>the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides</strong> and<strong>the comedies of Aristophanes.</strong></p><p> Just as significant for the modern world are the ancient Greek art and architecture. The principles of symmetry, harmony, and proportionality influenced Western architectural designs, including the construction of monuments and public buildings. The Greek column, for example, is a beloved element we’ve seen even in fashion!</p><h3 id="Ancient-Greek-influence-on-science-and-mathematics"><a href="#Ancient-Greek-influence-on-science-and-mathematics" class="headerlink" title="Ancient Greek influence on science and mathematics"></a>Ancient Greek influence on science and mathematics</h3><p> If we ask scientists, they’ll say that ancient Greeks made their most significant contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. For example, <strong>the principles and theorems formulated by Pythagoras are integral to the scientific heritage that has shaped Western civilization.</strong> Nowadays, children as young as 12 or 13 learn Pythagoras’ theorems in geometry – which, by the way, is another word of Greek origin.</p><p> Another excellent example of how the great thinkers of ancient Greece influenced the way our world looks like today is Hippocrates. Considered<strong>the “Father of Modern Medicine”, Hippocrates’</strong> name is well-known even by those not familiar with medical practices due to his famous ethics oath called<strong>the Hippocratic Oath.</strong> Initially, the oath mandated a new physician to vow, invoking several healing deities, to adhere to particular ethical guidelines. It represents the Western world’s first articulation of medical ethics, laying down foundational principles that continue to be critically important even in today’s medical ethics.</p><p> As you can see, Ancient Greece’s cultural influence is a treasure trove of wisdom that continues to inspire and shape the Western world to this day. These were only a few of the ideas and personalities that persisted through the ages. If you care to study the entire period of Ancient Greece, you’ll discover that many more people thought, said, or did great things during this time. So many that we start to wonder whether they had access to a magical fountain of endless inspiration!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ancient-greek-vs-modern-greek.jpg"                      alt="ancient Greek vs modern Greek" title="Ancient Greek Language Influence On Modern Languages 8"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997690/19272" target="_top" id="1997690">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997690" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997690/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Ancient-Greek-Language-Influence-on-Modern-Languages"><a href="#Ancient-Greek-Language-Influence-on-Modern-Languages" class="headerlink" title="Ancient Greek Language Influence on Modern Languages"></a>Ancient Greek Language Influence on Modern Languages</h2><p> Now that you have an overview of the intellectual and artistic heritage we received from ancient Greece, it’s time to take an even closer look at languages. Because yes, the Ancient Greek language has carved its imprints not just in the annals of history but in the very syntax and semantics of modern languages. <strong>English, Spanish, and French are probably the most important bearers of Greek influences.</strong></p><p> Whenever you say a word like ‘psychology’, ‘theater’, or ‘chronology’, you pay tribute to the ancient Greek language. Still, the linguistic legacy is not limited to vocabulary but extends to idiomatic expressions, grammatical structures, and even rhetorical styles. Keep in mind the fact that this influence happened despite the geographical distance between ancient Greece and the English-speaking world.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148644/16836" target="_top" id="2148644">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148644" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148644/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Enriching-the-modern-lexicon"><a href="#Enriching-the-modern-lexicon" class="headerlink" title="Enriching the modern lexicon"></a>Enriching the modern lexicon</h3><p> So, how does the ancient Greek language live on through the modern languages? Well, as we already settled, one of the most striking manifestations of its influence is on the vocabulary. The terms beginning with ‘ph-’ are probably the most obvious examples. <strong>Words like ‘philosophy’, ‘physical’, ‘photograph’, ‘phrase’, and ‘philanthropy’ all have roots in ancient Greek.</strong></p><p> What’s more, they are all very similar in all major languages. Let’s take ‘geography’ for instance. The word came in English from French, which in turn got it from Latin. Finally, Latin borrowed the word from the Greek_geōgraphia,_ with_gē_ meaning ‘earth’ and_-graphia_ meaning ‘writing’. A fascinating journey to be had for a single word! Now, if you look at how to say ‘geography’ in different languages, you’ll notice that all of them are very similar:</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >French <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> : <em>géographie</em></li><li>German: <em>Geografie</em></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> : <em>geografía</em></li></ul><p> As you can see, <strong>ancient Greek words have infiltrated the English language through a complex route, often via Latin and French,</strong> but their imprint is unmistakable. Although modern English contains numerous borrowed words from languages such as French, Italian, and Spanish, a significant portion of them actually originate from ancient Greek.</p><p> This is just one example among countless others where a modern English word owes its existence to Ancient Greek ancestry.

Thus, the transition from the ancient Greek language to the modern Greek language was all about adaptation and evolution. The language spoken in Plato’s Greece is indeed very different from the language spoken today in Greece. However, it is said that <strong>a person proficient in Modern Greek can generally understand about 50% of ancient Greek texts</strong> due to similar root words.</p><p> So, how different is ancient Greek from modern Greek? Let’s take a closer look.</p><ul><li><strong>Phonetics:</strong> The evolution from Ancient to Modern Greek involved significant phonetic and semantic changes, affecting both the sound and meaning of words. For example, Ancient Greek featured long and short vowels (which were important for poetry), various diphthongs, single and double consonants, and different types of stops. In contrast, modern Greek now has only short vowels and consonants. In addition, the pronunciation of several combinations of vowels (diphthongs) has also changed.</li><li><strong>Grammar:</strong> Ancient Greek had five cases and features like a dual number to refer to pairs and specific moods for desires and self-affected actions. Modern Greek, on the other hand, retains the dative case only in specific expressions and has dropped the dual number. Besides, certain verb forms and moods present in Ancient Greek are absent.</li><li><strong>Orthography:</strong> While ancient Greek used the polytonic orthography with many accents and only capital letters, modern Greek keeps only two <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek%5Fdiacritics" >diacritics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and uses both small and capital letters like in English.</li></ul><p> All in all, the transformation from ancient to modern Greek is characterized by a movement towards phonetic, grammatical, and semantic simplification while retaining core elements of the language’s rich history.</p><p> To summarize everything we learned about the ancient Greek language, let’s look at some frequently asked questions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043617/7443" target="_top" id="2043617">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043617" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043617/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Is-ancient-Greek-still-spoken-today"><a href="#Is-ancient-Greek-still-spoken-today" class="headerlink" title="Is ancient Greek still spoken today?"></a>Is ancient Greek still spoken today?</h3><p> Just like Latin, the ancient Greek language is still used in scholarly circles and ecclesiastical domains, preserved in texts and liturgies.

It is hypothesized to be descended from the older Linear A script which is undeciphered. However, around the 8th century BCE, Greeks adopted the Greek alphabet used today.</p><h3 id="How-can-I-learn-to-speak-ancient-Greek"><a href="#How-can-I-learn-to-speak-ancient-Greek" class="headerlink" title="How can I learn to speak ancient Greek?"></a>How can I learn to speak ancient Greek?</h3><p> Learning to speak ancient Greek may prove difficult because we still don’t know how the ancient Greek language sounded.

Our advice is to learn modern Greek first and then move to its predecessor with the help of classic texts and scholarly resources.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/ancient-greek-language/&t=Ancient+Greek+Language+Influence+on+Modern+Languages"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="Speak-Greek-like-a-true-philosopher"><a href="#Speak-Greek-like-a-true-philosopher" class="headerlink" title="Speak Greek like a true philosopher"></a>Speak Greek like a true philosopher</h3><p> The Modern Greek language may not be the exact same ancient lingo Platon spoke.

His name was St. Nicholas, and he was a monk in an area of the world now called Turkey. Known for intense generosity and devoting himself to the wellbeing of others, St. Nicholas spent his life traveling to poor areas of the country and donating his wealth to anyone who needed it. This reputation became legendary, and stories of St. Nicholas have been passed down through the generations and rewritten in various ways ever since.</p><p> Examining the Santa legend from the perspective of language learning is interesting. If Santa Claus was a real person today, what language would he speak? The area where the real St. Nicholas originated was once called Lycia, and the official language was Greek. Therefore, we can determine that Greek was Santa’s first spoken language.</p><h2 id="Santa-Claus-in-Various-Cultures-Christmas-in-All-Foreign-Languages"><a href="#Santa-Claus-in-Various-Cultures-Christmas-in-All-Foreign-Languages" class="headerlink" title="Santa Claus in Various Cultures: Christmas in All Foreign Languages"></a>Santa Claus in Various Cultures: Christmas in All Foreign Languages</h2><p> A variety of countries have their own legends about Santa, which is why he’s become such an interesting symbol of Christmas worldwide.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123738/7443" target="_top" id="2123738">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123738" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123738/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Santa-Claus-in-Norway"><a href="#1-Santa-Claus-in-Norway" class="headerlink" title="1. Santa Claus in Norway"></a>1. Santa Claus in Norway</h3><p> The Norwegians have some unique ideas about Santa Claus. Rather than coming from Lycia like the original St. Nicholas, they believe Santa was born under a rock in an area north of the town of Drøbak. They also believe that Drøbak is where he currently resides. Historians believe that this legend may have came about due to the Norwegian belief in the elder god Odin. Santa and Odin have a few similarities, including a white beard and the tendency to go down the chimney with gifts. They also both have help from the animal kingdom. Santa has his reindeer, and Odin has an eight-legged horse.</p><p> The Norwegian contribution to the Santa legend means that Santa is likely fluent in Norwegian. That’s a wonderful thing for Norwegian kids, who send over 30,000 letters to Santa Claus each year. If Santa didn’t speak Norwegian, the kids would have to learn a language before writing him!</p><h3 id="2-Santa-Claus-in-Mexico"><a href="#2-Santa-Claus-in-Mexico" class="headerlink" title="2. Santa Claus in Mexico"></a>2. Santa Claus in Mexico</h3><p> Christmas is an exciting part of the year for Mexican families, lasting from December to the second day of February, a holiday known as Candelaria. Epiphany is another special holiday that marks the season. It takes place on the sixth day of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >new year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and involves presents being left by the Three Kings. Visits from Santa can be expected on Christmas Eve, same as in most other cultures around the world. Since he’s been responding to the wishes of Spanish-speaking children in Mexico for many years, it makes sense to believe that Santa is <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >fluent in Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well.</p><h3 id="3-Santa-Claus-in-Russia"><a href="#3-Santa-Claus-in-Russia" class="headerlink" title="3. Santa Claus in Russia"></a>3. Santa Claus in Russia</h3><p> The Russian culture has its own unique spin on the Santa tale. Referred to as Ded Moroz, the Russian Santa has a long, white beard similar to the other versions. However, he dresses in Russian clothing and carries a large staff. His gifts arrive on New Years Eve rather than Christmas, and instead of the classic elves, he is assisted by his granddaughter, the Snow Maiden.</p><p> Even if the story is a bit different, the Russians seem to have a strong grasp on the Santa concept. That must mean that Santa has spent time in the country and can certainly <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >speak Russian <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as a result!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134498/18498" target="_top" id="2134498">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134498" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134498/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Santa-Claus-in-Sweden"><a href="#4-Santa-Claus-in-Sweden" class="headerlink" title="4.

He brings presents to children with the help of other gnomes, similar to the elf legend we see in other versions of the story. In Sweden, Christmas extends all the way to January 13th, when Christmas trees are officially taken down. With all that extra time in Sweden, it makes sense that Santa would have picked up Swedish.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080333/19272" target="_top" id="2080333">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080333" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080333/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Santa-Claus-in-Finland"><a href="#5-Santa-Claus-in-Finland" class="headerlink" title="5.

Referred to as Joulupukki, the Finnish Santa has horns on his head and was once considered a symbol of fertility. People in the area believe that Joulupukki lives in the northern part of the country with Mother Christmas and their helper gnomes, which means that Santa is certainly fluent in the language.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/languages-santa-claus-speak-christmas-around-world/&t=What+Languages+Does+Santa+Claus+Speak?+Christmas+Around+the+World"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2005183/22899" target="_top" id="2005183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2005183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2005183/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Learn-a-Language-Like-Santa-It-Won’t-Take-Long"><a href="#Learn-a-Language-Like-Santa-It-Won’t-Take-Long" class="headerlink" title="Learn a Language Like Santa: It Won’t Take Long"></a>Learn a Language Like Santa: It Won’t Take Long</h2><p> Santa has had many centuries to venture around the world learning languages and helping kids, but you won’t have to wait that long to learn the language of your choice.

Fasten your imaginary seatbelt because we’re about to take to the skies looking for<strong>the longest word in the world.</strong> My job, as a captain, is to make sure you find this journey fruitful and rich in big words! Meanwhile, my own deepest desire is to find “the one” –<strong>the longest word in English!</strong></p><p><strong>Warning:</strong> Those suffering from hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia (fear of long words) should not embark on this discovery mission. Here’s what we are going to learn today:</p><ul><li><a href="#longest-word-in-the-english-language">The longest word in English</a></li><li><a href="#longest-word-in-the-dictionary">The longest word in the dictionary</a></li><li><a href="#longest-german-word">The longest German word</a></li><li><a href="#longest-word-in-spanish">The longest word in Spanish</a></li><li><a href="#afrikaans">The longest word in Afrikaans</a></li><li><a href="#danish">The longest word in Danish</a></li><li><a href="#dutch">The longest word in Dutch</a></li><li><a href="#finnish">The longest word in Finnish</a></li><li><a href="#french">The longest word in French</a></li><li><a href="#icelandic">The longest word in Icelandic</a></li><li><a href="#italian">The longest word in Italian</a></li><li><a href="#greek">The longest word in Greek</a></li><li><a href="#polish">The longest word in Polish</a></li><li><a href="#turkish">The longest word in Turkish</a></li><li><a href="#welsh">The longest word in Welsh</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-is-the-longest-word-in-the-world"><a href="#What-is-the-longest-word-in-the-world" class="headerlink" title="What is the longest word in the world?"></a>What is the longest word in the world?</h2><p> Like any discovery mission that dreams big, our first stop explores a ridiculously long word –<strong>189,819 letters</strong> – that is also kinda fake. Sorry to ruin it for you. It would have been too good to be true, just like Hogwarts.</p><p> So long story short, yes,<strong>the longest word in the world is 189,819-letters long.</strong> But it’s a hoax. Its genesis is fascinating though.</p><p> As you very well know, chemical names can sometimes be sesquipedalian (&#x3D; very long). This is also the case of titin – a giant human protein responsible for the muscle’s passive elasticity. Although it has its name derived from the giant Greek deity Titan, titin was annoyed at the fact that it sounded cute, so it asked The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry for a name worthy of its size.</p><p> Just joking! But yes, titin also has the longest IUPAC name of a protein. Its 189,819 letters long name would take around three and a half hours to pronounce. You can find various attempts on Youtube or… you can try and pronounce that yourself and accept the honorary title of The King&#x2F;Queen of Pronunciation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screaming-goose-960x638.jpg"                      alt="screaming goose" title="What Is The Longest Word In The World? 2"                ></p><p> “WHAT?” by Hussain Badshah©</p><p> Unfortunately for titin, its chemical name hasn’t made it into any of the major dictionaries. So that is why it’s “unofficial”. In fact, many argue that this isn’t even a word.</p><p>Anyway, here’s a glimpse of the little titan’s name:</p><p> <strong>Methionylthreonylthreonylglutaminylarginyltyrosylglutamylserylleucylphenylalanylalanylglut</strong></p><p> <strong>aminylleucyllysylglutamylarginyllysylglutamylglycylalanylphenylalanylvalylprolylphenylalanyl</strong></p><p> <strong>valylthreonylleucylglycylaspartylprolylglycylisoleucylglutamylglutaminylserylleucyllysylisoleu</strong></p><p> <strong>cylaspartylthreonylleucylisoleucylglutamylalanylglycylalanylaspartylalanylleucylglutamylleucy</strong></p><p> <strong>lglycylisoleucylprolylphenylalanylserylaspartylprolylleucylalanylaspartylglycylprolylthreonylis</strong></p><p> <strong>oleucylglutaminylasparaginylalanylthreonylleucylarginylalanylphenylalanylalanylalanylglycylv</strong></p><p><strong>alylthreonyl</strong> (………. blah blah blah)<strong>glutaminylalanylarginylthreonylthreonylglutaminylvalylgluta</strong></p><p><strong>min</strong> <strong>ylglutaminylphenylalanylseryl</strong> <strong>glutaminylvalyltryptophyllysylprolylphenylalanylprolylgluta</strong></p><p><strong>minylserylthreonylvalylarginylphen</strong> <strong>ylalanylprolylglycylaspartylvalyltyrosyllysylvalyltyrosylargi</strong></p><p><strong>nyltyrosylasparaginylalanylvalylleucy</strong> <strong>laspartylprolylleucylisoleucylthreonylalanylleucylleucylgl</strong></p><p><strong>ycylthreonylphenylalanylaspartylthreo</strong> <strong>nylarginylasparaginylarginylisoleucylisoleucylglutamylv</strong></p><p><strong>alylglutamylasparaginylglutaminylgluta</strong> <strong>minylserylglutamylasparaginylglutaminylglutaminylser</strong></p><p><strong>ylglutamylasparaginylglutaminylglutamin</strong>   <strong>ylserxisoleucine .</strong></p><p>Good luck posting it on Twitter!</p><h2 id="The-longest-word-in-English-–-fake-version-turned-official"><a href="#The-longest-word-in-English-–-fake-version-turned-official" class="headerlink" title="The longest word in English – fake version turned official"></a>The longest word in English – fake version turned official</h2><p> This is getting more and more interesting. This next word wasn’t originally mentioned in any major dictionaries. In fact, it was originally invented by the president of the National Puzzlers’ League as a synonym for the disease known as silicosis with the sole purpose of becoming a candidate for the longest word in English.</p><p> <strong>Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis</strong>  – because this is the word we are talking about – is<strong>45 letters long</strong> and <a class="link"   href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis" >Oxford Dictionaries define it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as “an invented long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust” (silica or quartz dust – hence the shortened version of “silicosis”).</p><p> The 45-letter “Godzilla” word, lately referred to as “P45”, first appeared in the 1939 supplement to the Merriam-Webster New International Dictionary, Second Edition.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/surprised-lemur-960x639.jpg"                      alt="surprised lemur" title="What Is The Longest Word In The World? 3"                ></p><p> “I don’t believe you!” by Maik Stahnke©</p><h2 id="The-longest-word-in-the-dictionary-–-really-official-version"><a href="#The-longest-word-in-the-dictionary-–-really-official-version" class="headerlink" title="The longest word in the dictionary – really official version"></a>The longest word in the dictionary – really official version</h2><p>Enough with the jokes already!

Many say that<strong>“floccinaucinihilipilification” (29-letters)</strong> should be crowned the longest non-coined, non-technical word, but some regard it as coined. However,<a class="link"   href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/floccinaucinihilipilification" >Oxford Dictionaries define it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as “the action or habit of estimating something as worthless”. The poor freak originates from Latin_flocci, nauci, nihili, pili_ (words meaning ‘at little value’) + -fication.</p><p> Moving on, we find out that others mention<strong>“antidisestablishmentarianism” (28 letters)</strong> as the longest non-coined, non-technical word. While <a class="link"   href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/antidisestablishmentarianism" >Oxford Dictionaries define this as <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> “opposition to the disestablishment of the Church of England”,<a class="link"   href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/no-antidisestablishmentarianism-is-not-in-the-dictionary" >Merriam Webster has a very strong opinion on that <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and claims that this word does not deserve its place in the dictionary: “we can’t put antidisestablishmentarianism in the dictionary because there’s hardly any record of its use as a real word. It’s only cited as an example of a long word—which is not the same thing”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/jkFGHT7XLzpg4/giphy.gif"                      alt="longest word in the english language" title="What Is The Longest Word In The World? 5"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137393/7443" target="_top" id="2137393">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137393" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137393/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Finally, the word everybody seems to agree on is <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/electroencephalographically"><strong>electroencephalographically (27 letters)</strong></a> . Fair enough! We heard about that, haven’t we? By the sound of it, I’d say it’s connected to the “electroencephalograph” – a machine used to measure electrical activity in different parts of the brain.</p><p> Now that you know all the arguments of this complicated debate, feel free to be the judge and decide which one is the longest word in the dictionary,<strong>the longest word in the English language</strong> or even the longest word in the galaxy!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136548/16384" target="_top" id="2136548">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136548" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136548/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-supercalifragilisticexpialidocious-34-letters"><a href="#Bonus-supercalifragilisticexpialidocious-34-letters" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: supercalifragilisticexpialidocious (34 letters)"></a>Bonus: supercalifragilisticexpialidocious (34 letters)</h2><p> This is your absolute favorite.

But before getting into this, you should know a little bit about<strong>agglutinative languages</strong> . If you ever studied Latin, you may have already guessed that “agglutinative” is derived from the Latin verb_agglutinare_ , which means “to glue together”. Thus, <strong>agglutinative languages are those languages that allow the creation of long words via compounding</strong> and German, Dutch and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Persian <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are just a few of them.</p><p> Back to our main mission,<strong>the longest German word</strong> that was not created artificially seems to be <strong>rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz (63 letters)</strong> . The word literally means “law delegating beef label monitoring”.</p><p> <strong>Donaudampfschiffahrtselektrizitätenhauptbetriebswerkbauunterbeamtengesellschaft (79 letters)</strong> , was crowned<strong>the longest published word in the German language</strong> by the 1972 Guinness Book of World Records, but it seems that even longer words are possible. The gigantic word translates to “Association for Subordinate Officials of the Main Maintenance Building of the Danube Steam Shipping Electrical Services”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/funny-monkey-960x636.jpg"                      alt="funny monkey" title="What Is The Longest Word In The World? 6"                ></p><p> “Oh my God, really?” by Jamie Haughton©</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043618/7443" target="_top" id="2043618">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043618" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043618/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-longest-word-in-Spanish-and-11-other-languages"><a href="#The-longest-word-in-Spanish-and-11-other-languages" class="headerlink" title="The longest word in Spanish and 11 other languages"></a>The longest word in Spanish and 11 other languages</h2><p> Because it is considered a global language and the world’s second-<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >most spoken native language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , after Mandarin Chinese, I decided I must include<strong>the longest word in Spanish</strong> in our discovery mission.</p><p> So here it is:<strong>the longest word in Spanish is</strong> <strong>esternocleidomastoideitis (30 letters)</strong> – this is a medical term which translates to “inflammation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle”.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Your-Travel-Guide-for-The-Next-Trip-to-Israel-Tips-Travel-Phrases"><a href="#Your-Travel-Guide-for-The-Next-Trip-to-Israel-Tips-Travel-Phrases" class="headerlink" title="Your Travel Guide for The Next Trip to Israel: Tips &amp; Travel Phrases"></a>Your Travel Guide for The Next Trip to Israel: Tips &amp; Travel Phrases</h2><p> There are few places on Earth as magic and as contrasting as The Holy Land of Israel. From finding God within the ancient walls of Nazareth and Jerusalem, you can then experience the vibrating nightlife and stunning beaches of Tel-Aviv, praise the beauty of the Bahá’í Gardens in Haifa, float quietly in the arms of the Dead Sea or get lost in the immensity of the Negev Desert. It’s a dream. You’ll love every piece of this land and you’ll even want to come back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hebrew-travel-phrases-1024x682.jpg"                      alt="hebrew travel phrases" title="Your Travel Guide For The Next Trip To Israel: Tips &Amp; Travel Phrases 2"                ></p><p> “Western Wall, Jerusalem, Israel” by Sander Crombach©</p><p> Of course, as you already know, every travel destination has its downsides. You won’t like every aspect of traveling to Israel. But that’s only natural. To voice your concerns: yes, knowing the history of Israel, it’s important to keep safety in mind, but you must not let it control you.</p><p> So here are some tips and all the basic Hebrew phrases you need to know before packing your bags for the long-awaited trip to Israel.</p><h2 id="Here’s-what-you-should-know-before-traveling-to-Israel"><a href="#Here’s-what-you-should-know-before-traveling-to-Israel" class="headerlink" title="Here’s what you should know before traveling to Israel"></a>Here’s what you should know before traveling to Israel</h2><p><strong>The best time to go to Israel:</strong> If you want to sunbathe on the beaches of Tel Aviv or snorkel in Eilat, the best time to go to Israel is between June and September. On the other hand, if you are a person that feels more comfortable with lower temperatures, the periods between April – May and October-November are the best for you to explore the country and spend time in Jerusalem. However, during these months you should pack clothes that you can wear in layers because the weather can change fast from really sunny to cold and vice-versa.</p><p><strong>Don’t forget to:</strong> Pack various clothing items for multiple occasions and be mindful of what you wear. As a sign of respect towards all the religions that shake hands in the Holy City, it would be advised to follow the unspoken rules and always have scarf or shawl ready in case of an “emergency” visit to a holy site. While in Tel Aviv you can wear anything you want, in Jerusalem and Nazareth modesty is expected.</p><p><strong>Language:</strong> Hebrew is <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Israel’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> official language. Almost everybody speaks Hebrew as a first or second language. That is why you should stick around until the end of the article and learn the basic Hebrew words and phrases we have selected for your trip to Israel.</p><p> In addition to Hebrew, you will also hear <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Arabic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (about one-fifth of the population is constituted by the Arab minority) and, of course, English. Not everybody speaks perfect English in Israel, but they certainly try. Since tourism is a central part of the country’s economy, shop, pub and restaurant owners try to keep the channel of communication open with the tourists.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hebrew-phrases-1024x682.jpg"                      alt="hebrew phrases" title="Your Travel Guide For The Next Trip To Israel: Tips &Amp; Travel Phrases 3"                ></p><p> “Mahane Yehuda Market, Jerusalem, Israel” by Roxanne Desgagnés©</p><p><strong>Weather:</strong> Since Israel is a Mediterranean country, the weather is a sweet summer dream for everyone who loves the sun. During summer, the temperatures usually hover around 80 °F (27 °C) and 90 °F (32 °C). Spring and autumn are a little cooler at around 60 – 70 °F (15 – 25 °C) during the day in most cities and 40 – 50 °F (5-10 °C) during the night in Jerusalem. During the winter, the temperatures go as low as 40 °F (5 °C) in Jerusalem and 50 – 60 °F (10 – 15 °C) in the rest of the country.</p><p><strong>Getting around:</strong> Lucky for us tourists, public transport in Jerusalem is great. The tram usually runs from one side of the city to the other and there are companies that offer minibus shuttle transfers between a lot of destinations. But if you want an even more comfortable way of getting around, Uber has a brother in Israel and his name is Gett.</p><p><strong>Currency:</strong> The currency of Israel is the Israeli Shekel ₪ (ILS). One dollar is 3.51 ILS and one euro is 3.88 ILS.</p><p> Just to be sure, our advice would be to have at least half of your vacation money in cash. Depending on the city you are visiting, paying with a credit card may not be an option.</p><p><strong>Typical costs:</strong> As many people say, Israel is not a cheap destination. For example, a three-course meal for two people at a mid-range restaurant is around 220 ISL (51.46€ or $62.53). That’s quite pricey. However, if you are on a tight budget, you can limit yourself to eating fast-food which is typically cheaper is most countries. Lose the potatoes, keep the meat and the green vegetables and you’ve made yourself a pretty decent meal.</p><p> A good reference point that can help you compare typical costs around the world is the water bottle. In Israel, a water bottle is €4.20 (1.5-liter bottle) in stores and around €1.72 (0.33-liter bottle) in most restaurants and cafés. Compare that to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Greece <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , where the same water bottles are €0.50 in stores and around €1 in most restaurants and judge for yourself.</p><p> Find out even more details about typical costs in Israel right <a class="link"   href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country%5Fresult.jsp?country=Israel" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="15-Hebrew-words-you’ll-need-in-your-vacation"><a href="#15-Hebrew-words-you’ll-need-in-your-vacation" class="headerlink" title="15 Hebrew words you’ll need in your vacation"></a>15 Hebrew words you’ll need in your vacation</h2><p> Now that you know some of the most important tips and insights about vacationing in Israel, let’s continue with some basic Hebrew words you will probably need during this amazing trip to Israel:</p><ul><li>Yes. –<em>כן. – Ken.</em></li><li>No. –<em>לא. – Lo.</em></li><li>pharmacy –<em>בית מרקחת – beyt merkachat</em></li><li>ticket –<em>כרטיס -– kartees</em></li><li>toilet –<em>שירותים – shehrooteem</em></li><li>airport –<em>שדה תעופה – sdeh te’oofa</em></li><li>taxi –<em>מונית – moneet</em></li><li>train station –<em>תחנת רכבת – takhanat rakevet</em></li><li>bus station –<em>תחנת האוטובוס – takhanat ha’otoboos</em></li><li>hotel –<em>בית מלון – beyt malon</em></li><li>beach –<em>חוף – khof</em></li><li>help –<em>עזר – azar</em></li><li>restaurant –<em>מסעדה – mees’ada</em></li><li>supermarket –<em>כלבו – kolbo</em></li><li>souvenir –<em>מזכרת – mazkeret</em></li></ul><h2 id="Top-5-places-you-must-visit-in-Israel"><a href="#Top-5-places-you-must-visit-in-Israel" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 places you must visit in Israel"></a>Top 5 places you must visit in Israel</h2><p> Before moving on to the Hebrew travel phrases that will make your vacation ten times better (yes, learning the language of the natives does that!), let’s discover the top five most beautiful places in Israel. Like we already mentioned, this country is a dream. From beaches to gardens and holy sanctuaries. So let’s discover the most beautiful of them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925570/19272" target="_top" id="1925570">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925570" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925570/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Jerusalem-and-Nazareth"><a href="#1-Jerusalem-and-Nazareth" class="headerlink" title="1.

In addition to their great religious value, these cities are rich in art, culture and thousands of years of history. You’ll undoubtedly love every minute spend exploring their streets and never forget your experience there.</p><h3 id="2-Tel-Aviv"><a href="#2-Tel-Aviv" class="headerlink" title="2. Tel-Aviv"></a>2. Tel-Aviv</h3><p> If you are a sucker for beaches, parties, museums and 1930 Bauhaus buildings, Tel-Aviv is the place to go. With its open-minded, diverse society, you’ll find Tel-Aviv surprisingly different than what you may have had in mind. For example, some of the most important events taking place in Tel-Aviv yearly are Gay Pride Parade, Purim Street Party and Tel Aviv Fashion Week. Cool, isn’t it?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hebrew-words-1024x767.jpg"                      alt="hebrew words" title="Your Travel Guide For The Next Trip To Israel: Tips &Amp; Travel Phrases 4"                ></p><p> “Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel” by Shai Pal©</p><h3 id="3-The-Dead-Sea"><a href="#3-The-Dead-Sea" class="headerlink" title="3. The Dead Sea"></a>3. The Dead Sea</h3><p> With its surface and shores at 1,412 ft (430.5 meters) below sea level, The Dead Sea is Earth’s lowest elevation on land. With only that fact in mind, The Dead Sea immediately becomes a must-see place not only for Israel but for the entire world. On top of it all, it is also one of the world’s saltiest bodies of water.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/travel-to-israel-1024x682.jpg"                      alt="travel to israel" title="Your Travel Guide For The Next Trip To Israel: Tips &Amp; Travel Phrases 5"                ></p><p> “The Dead Sea” by Dave Herring©</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137226/26400" target="_top" id="2137226">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137226" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137226/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Haifa"><a href="#4-Haifa" class="headerlink" title="4.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Macau-A-Study-in-Linguistic-Convergence"><a href="#Macau-A-Study-in-Linguistic-Convergence" class="headerlink" title="Macau: A Study in Linguistic Convergence"></a>Macau: A Study in Linguistic Convergence</h2><p> <strong>Macau’s language tapestry is a fascinating blend of Cantonese, Portuguese, and Macanese</strong> —a Portuguese-based creole. This intriguing linguistic composition serves as a testament to the region’s rich historical background and cultural amalgamation. Once a Portuguese colony, the city of Macau is now officially known as the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China. As a result, the Macau language, with its harmonious combination of these languages, plays a vital role in shaping this city’s unique cultural personality.</p><p> Nestled in the western Pearl River Delta by the South China Sea, Macau is a vibrant city home to approximately 680,000 inhabitants within a compact area of only 32.9 km2. So it’s no surprise that it is one of<strong>the most densely populated regions in the world.</strong> Though, the most fascinating thing about Macau remains its special blend of Eastern and Western cultures that offer a unique cultural identity that cannot be found anywhere else on the planet.</p><p> Ready to find our more about the rich linguistic mosaic of Macau? Read on to discover the intriguing history behind this captivating blend of languages.</p><h2 id="The-History-of-Macau"><a href="#The-History-of-Macau" class="headerlink" title="The History of Macau"></a>The History of Macau</h2><p> The current linguistic mosaic of Macau began taking shape almost 500 years ago. It all started in 1557, when<strong>the Ming dynasty leased Macau to Portugal</strong> as a trading post. Naturally, this marked the beginning of a significant Portuguese presence in Macau, introducing the Portuguese language and culture to the region.</p><p> The subsequent union of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Portuguese and Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> crowns from 1580 to 1640 further solidified Macau’s prominence as a major trading hub between Europe and the Far East. However, the establishment of a British trading post in nearby Hong Kong in 1750 brought about increased British influence, leading to disputes and a decline in Macau’s prominence as a trading center.</p><p> Portugal continued to administer Macau until 1999, when sovereignty was transferred back to China.</p><p> Today, Macau is a thriving gambling destination – often referred to as the “Las Vegas of the East” – with a degree of autonomy from Beijing and a gambling industry seven times larger than that of Las Vegas. The city is renowned for its high per capita incomes, ranking among the highest globally, and its impressive Human Development Index, which places it fourth worldwide in terms of life expectancy.</p><p> Furthermore, approximately two-thirds of the city’s land area consists of reclaimed land from the sea, making the territory highly urbanized.</p><p> Despite its tumultuous history, Macau is the perfect example of a happy ending.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139117/17108" target="_top" id="2139117">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139117" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139117/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Multilingualism-in-Macau"><a href="#Multilingualism-in-Macau" class="headerlink" title="Multilingualism in Macau"></a>Multilingualism in Macau</h2><p> Now that you know the history behind it, the Macau linguistic heritage makes much more sense.</p><p><strong>The official languages of Macau are Chinese and Portuguese.</strong> Given Macau’s history as a Portuguese colony, you’d think many people in Macau speak Portuguese. However, in reality, things are different and Portuguese is spoken by only 2.3% of the people.</p><p><strong>The most widely spoken language in Macau is Cantonese,</strong> which is used in everyday life by over 85% of the population. It is the de facto Chinese dialect in Macau, with strong cultural assimilation and usage in personal interactions.</p><p> <strong>Other languages spoken in Macau include Mandarin, Macanese Portuguese, English and other Chinese variants.</strong> English is usually spoken by those who are engaged in trade, commerce and tourism, while Mandarin is taught and used for official purposes and business dealings with mainland China.</p><p> Interestingly enough, English and Mandarin speakers are more prevalent in Macau compared to Portuguese speakers. While Portuguese is the official of Macau, the British and Chinese cultures exercise a much greater influence on a global scale.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cantonese.jpg"                      alt="Cantonese in Macau" title="Exploring Macau’s Linguistic Mosaic: Cantonese, Macanese, And Portuguese Languages 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/857865/11832" target="_top" id="857865">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-857865" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/857865/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Macanese-A-Distinctive-Creole-Language-of-Macau"><a href="#Macanese-A-Distinctive-Creole-Language-of-Macau" class="headerlink" title="Macanese: A Distinctive Creole Language of Macau"></a>Macanese: A Distinctive Creole Language of Macau</h2><p><strong>Macanese Patois or the Macanese creole language, known as Patuá</strong> to its speakers, is a mixture of Cantonese, Malay, Sinhalese, and – most importantly – Portuguese. Developed as a lingua franca for communication among the multicultural community of traders, sailors, and settlers, Macanse emerged as a unique language reflecting the melting pot of cultures that Macau represented.</p><p> Known as the<strong>“sunset creole of Macau”</strong> , Macanese is mostly spoken by those of mixed heritage but is fading out among the younger generation. As a matter of fact, UNESCO’s <a class="link"   href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000187026" >Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> even classifies Patuá as a “critically endangered” language.</p><p> The development of Macau’s signature language initially occurred primarily among the descendants of Portuguese settlers in Macau. Instead of marrying locals from neighboring China, they often married women from Portuguese Malacca, Portuguese India, and Portuguese Ceylon. This led to the language adopting notable influences from Malay and Sinhala. In the 17th century, Macanese underwent a further transformation when immigrants from other Portuguese colonies in Asia arrived.</p><p> Even during the time when Macau was Portuguese territory, the usage of Macanese was already declining, and this trend is unlikely to change now that the territory is under Chinese administration. However, speakers of Macanese still hold a deep sense of pride in the fact that Macau has its unique local language.</p><h2 id="Portuguese-in-Macau-A-Journey-of-11-000-km"><a href="#Portuguese-in-Macau-A-Journey-of-11-000-km" class="headerlink" title="Portuguese in Macau: A Journey of 11,000 km"></a>Portuguese in Macau: A Journey of 11,000 km</h2><p> The story of how Portuguese came to Macau and established its presence is truly captivating. While the number of Portuguese speakers in Macau may be small today, the Portuguese influence remains evident in various aspects of Macau’s culture. This influence is particularly noticeable in the legal and administrative sectors, as well as in place names, cuisine, and other cultural elements.</p><p> Additionally, Macau boasts a vibrant Portuguese media presence, which encompasses three daily newspapers, one radio station, and a television channel.</p><p> The linguistic connection between Macau and Portugal also results in significant movement between the two regions. According to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.dsec.gov.mo/Censos2021/en-US/" >2021 Macau Census <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , individuals born in Portugal make up around 0.3% of Macau’s total population, indicating a notable presence of Portuguese-born residents in Macau.</p><h3 id="Official-Portuguese-Usage-in-Macau"><a href="#Official-Portuguese-Usage-in-Macau" class="headerlink" title="Official Portuguese Usage in Macau"></a>Official Portuguese Usage in Macau</h3><p> Despite the relatively small number of Portuguese speakers in Macau, the local government remains committed to promoting the Portuguese language. In public schools, students are taught Chinese, English, and Portuguese, reflecting the importance of these languages in the education system. Additionally, the government offers free programs to facilitate the learning of Portuguese among the general population.</p><p> In official government documents, both written Portuguese and written Chinese (traditional) are used. This dual-language approach demonstrates the recognition and value given to both languages in administrative matters. In daily life, it is common to come across signs and displays in Macau that feature written Chinese and written Portuguese. This parallel use of languages is similar to the coexistence of written Chinese and British English in Hong Kong.</p><h2 id="Cantonese-The-Dominant-Language-of-Macau"><a href="#Cantonese-The-Dominant-Language-of-Macau" class="headerlink" title="Cantonese: The Dominant Language of Macau"></a>Cantonese: The Dominant Language of Macau</h2><p> Cantonese, a variant of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Chinese language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , is spoken in Macau, Hong Kong, Southern China, as well as by Chinese communities in North America and Southeast Asian countries. While Cantonese is considered a dialect of Chinese, it is important to note that Mandarin and Cantonese are not mutually intelligible, meaning speakers of one may not understand the other.</p><p> <strong>Despite the city’s historical ties with Portugal, Cantonese firmly dominates the social, commercial, and educational landscapes of Macau.</strong> Over 85% of people in Macau speak Cantonese.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/multilingualism-in-macau.jpg"                      alt="multilingualism in Macau" title="Exploring Macau’s Linguistic Mosaic: Cantonese, Macanese, And Portuguese Languages 3"                ></p><p> Cantonese serves as the primary medium of instruction in the majority of schools in Macau. Additionally, there are mandatory classes that focus on Mandarin, ensuring students have exposure to and proficiency in the official language of China.</p><h2 id="The-Future-of-Macau’s-Languages"><a href="#The-Future-of-Macau’s-Languages" class="headerlink" title="The Future of Macau’s Languages"></a>The Future of Macau’s Languages</h2><p> The future of Macau’s languages, particularly Macanese and Portuguese, is uncertain at this point. Their survival in Macau depends on preservation efforts and demographic shifts.</p><p> In May 2012, the Public Administration and Civil Service Bureau of the Macau Special Administrative Region issued a circular emphasizing the equal importance of Chinese and Portuguese as the official languages of Macau. They urged public administrations to use both languages when releasing information to the public and requested that any existing information available in only one language be supplemented in the other language. Therefore, Portuguese in Macau seems to be safe for now as it is protected by law.</p><p> As China’s influence continues to grow, there has also been a rise in the use of Mandarin. Still, Cantonese remains dominant. On the other hand, Macanese (Patuá), with its small number of speakers, is in danger of extinction. In order to safeguard this distinctive aspect of Macau’s cultural heritage, concerted efforts are said to be made to preserve and promote Macanese through various cultural events and initiatives.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134229/18498" target="_top" id="2134229">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134229" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134229/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Is-English-widely-spoken-in-Macau"><a href="#Is-English-widely-spoken-in-Macau" class="headerlink" title="Is English widely spoken in Macau?"></a>Is English widely spoken in Macau?</h3><p> English is not as widely spoken in Macau compared to Cantonese. However, due to Macau’s status as popular gambling destination, English is commonly understood and spoken. Many signs, menus, and information for tourists are also available in English. Additionally, English is taught as a compulsory subject in schools, contributing to a level of English proficiency among the younger generation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1155462">                    <video width="1024" height="576" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1155462.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1155462">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1155462.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:640px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1155462%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1155462/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Are-there-any-efforts-to-revitalize-endangered-languages-in-Macau"><a href="#Are-there-any-efforts-to-revitalize-endangered-languages-in-Macau" class="headerlink" title="Are there any efforts to revitalize endangered languages in Macau?"></a>Are there any efforts to revitalize endangered languages in Macau?</h3><p> There are Macanese individuals who are actively engaged in revitalizing the language through various creative mediums such as literature, theater, and music. However, the success of language revival ultimately relies on the active participation of younger generations—the ones who will be responsible for carrying it forward into the mid-twenty-first century.

It can also be intimidating. Many people would like to learn a foreign language, but they feel the task would be too hard. This is unfortunate because with a little effort and a commitment to the goal, learning a language can happen sooner than most people think.</p><h2 id="The-Old-Methods-Do-They-Make-It-More-Difficult-to-Learn-a-Foreign-Language"><a href="#The-Old-Methods-Do-They-Make-It-More-Difficult-to-Learn-a-Foreign-Language" class="headerlink" title="**The Old Methods: Do They Make It More Difficult to Learn a Foreign Language"></a>**The Old Methods: Do They Make It More Difficult to Learn a Foreign Language</h2><p>Chances are that you probably took language classes at some point in your educational history. Anywhere you live, school curriculums include the study of foreign languages, but the average high-school student does not graduate with fluency in another language.</p><p>Many students can manage reading and writing in a foreign language, but they struggle to understand it in conversational form. These situations make it clear that the past methods of language education are lacking. What is the solution?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484910/16446" target="_top" id="1484910">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484910" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484910/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Language-Learning-What-Holds-People-Back"><a href="#Language-Learning-What-Holds-People-Back" class="headerlink" title="Language Learning: What Holds People Back?"></a><strong>Language Learning: What Holds People Back?</strong></h2><p>One of the best ways to learn a language is to practice both writing the language and speaking it in a conversational manner. This is where many people panic and lose confidence in everything they have learned. If you’re new at a language, chances are that you haven’t even begun to grasp all the important grammar rules. This can lead to insecurity about sounding stupid when you write or speak the language, and this fear might hold you back from practicing.</p><p>This is why a focus on grammar is the wrong way to teach and learn a language. Grammar is the art of perfecting the use of a language you already know. When learning a language, it can hold students back in a variety of ways.</p><h3 id="1-Complexity"><a href="#1-Complexity" class="headerlink" title="1. Complexity"></a><strong>1. Complexity</strong></h3><p>There is a lot to take in when learning a language. The last thing a student needs is to get bogged down in a sea of confusing grammar rules. Of course, there are languages with simpler rules. For example, the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >French grammar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is more difficult than <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >the German grammar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but unless you’re naturally gifted at learning languages, realizing there are so many grammar rules to figure out might leave you so discouraged that you give up.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2005183/22899" target="_top" id="2005183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2005183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2005183/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Incorrect-Focus"><a href="#2-Incorrect-Focus" class="headerlink" title="2. Incorrect Focus"></a><strong>2. Incorrect Focus</strong></h3><p>Grammar rules are generally about perfecting the written language. This isn’t to say that having a strong grasp on the written aspects of the language are not important. After all, many people do the majority of their communication online these days. However, if your aim is to learn to speak a foreign language, then spending a large amount of time focusing on grammar might be holding you back.</p><p>The goal for a language student is to become fluent as quickly as possible. Fluency with the spoken word will transfer to an understanding of the written word as well. The old models of teaching do not place importance on becoming fluent as quickly as possible, and it seems this is a huge part of the problem.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868571/19272" target="_top" id="1868571">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868571" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868571/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-A-Lack-of-Conversational-Aspects"><a href="#3-A-Lack-of-Conversational-Aspects" class="headerlink" title="3.

We choose different words, use slang and sometimes even say things in a different order than we would when writing them down. How many people do you know who speak using perfect grammar? Sure, some might exist, but it isn’t very common regardless what language we are discussing. For this reason, if you insist on studying grammar first and conversational language second, you might struggle to understand people as they speak.

You learned by listening to the people around you speak. Since all children learn languages by focusing on the spoken word, shouldn’t adults do the same? Why are our schools placing such importance on perfect grammar?</p><p>It makes much more sense to first develop fluency in speaking the language. Once a student is comfortable, more focus can be placed on perfecting grammar. It’s difficult to perfect upon a language you don’t yet understand.</p><p>If worrying about grammar has been holding you back in language learning, allow yourself to forget about that aspect for now. Instead, focus on having fun and staying positive as you learn. Keeping a healthy attitude and enjoying the process is the best way to set yourself up for success, and if you keep at it, you’ll be having conversations in your chosen language before you know it.</p><p>Do you feel that grammar holds you back from learning a language?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Cousins’-Contrast-Spain’s-Spanish-Compared-to-Portugal’e-Portuguese"><a href="#The-Cousins’-Contrast-Spain’s-Spanish-Compared-to-Portugal’e-Portuguese" class="headerlink" title="The Cousins’ Contrast: Spain’s Spanish Compared to Portugal’e Portuguese"></a>The Cousins’ Contrast: Spain’s Spanish Compared to Portugal’e Portuguese</h2><p> We all know that languages coming from the same language family generally share similar traits. That’s canonical for most language families. In our case, the Romance languages descend from Vulgar Latin and that is the reason why there are so many words that sound almost the same in all five languages (six – if you count in Latin). For example, the word “water” is “aqua” in Latin, “agua” in Spanish, “água” in Portuguese, “acqua” in Italian, “eau” in French and “apă” in Romanian. Except for French and Romanian, they are all similar. Still, as you were right to think,<strong>Spanish and Portuguese are the most alike.</strong> So yes, Portuguese is similar to Spanish, but how mutually intelligible are they? Let the Spanish vs. Portuguese battle begin!</p><h2 id="Common-Misconceptions-Portuguese-Is-Not-Spanish"><a href="#Common-Misconceptions-Portuguese-Is-Not-Spanish" class="headerlink" title="Common Misconceptions: Portuguese Is Not Spanish"></a>Common Misconceptions: Portuguese Is Not Spanish</h2><p> This is probably one of the most common language-related misconceptions. No, Portuguese is not Spanish, but they were both born in the Iberian Peninsula somehow isolated from the rest of the land by the Pyrenees. For this reason, it’s only natural for them to resemble in a lot of ways. After all, there’s an almost<strong>90% lexical similarity</strong> between the two, meaning that 90% of their words have a cognate (equivalent) in the other language. So, naturally, if you speak one, you’ll probably understand a part of the second but don’t count on being able to speak it fluently.</p><p> Here are the main characteristics that make Spanish and Portuguese different, but also quite similar:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Language</th><th>Spanish</th><th>Portuguese</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Native Speakers</td><td>Approximately 480 million</td><td>Approximately 215 million</td></tr><tr><td>Official Language in</td><td>21 countries</td><td>10 countries</td></tr><tr><td>Word Order</td><td>Word Order Subject-Verb-Object</td><td>Subject-Object-Verb</td></tr><tr><td>Pronunciation Differences</td><td>Distinct “z” and “c” sounds</td><td>Voiceless fricative “s” sound</td></tr><tr><td>Variants</td><td>European Spanish Latin American Spanish</td><td>European Portuguese Brazilian Portuguese</td></tr><tr><td>Mutual Intelligibility</td><td>Written: High, Spoken: Moderate</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Lexical Similarity</td><td>Around 90%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Language Family</td><td>Romance</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Mutual-Intelligibility-Written-vs-Spoken-Forms"><a href="#Mutual-Intelligibility-Written-vs-Spoken-Forms" class="headerlink" title="Mutual Intelligibility: Written vs. Spoken Forms"></a>Mutual Intelligibility: Written vs. Spoken Forms</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Spoken Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Portuguese are less mutually intelligible than their written forms. In other words, on paper, the two languages look very similar and speakers of either language can generally read the other language without too much struggle. But when it comes to the spoken forms or the phonology, things get a bit more complicated as the pronunciation is more different than you’d expect. However, it is said that Portuguese speakers typically understand spoken Spanish better than Spanish speakers understand spoken Portuguese. After all, there’s an almost 90% lexical similarity between the two.</p><p> To help you observe the written mutual intelligibility between Spanish and Portuguese better, let’s look at a short basic lesson on verbs in two variations:</p><h3 id="Portuguese-to-Spanish"><a href="#Portuguese-to-Spanish" class="headerlink" title="Portuguese to Spanish"></a>Portuguese to Spanish</h3><h3 id="Spanish-to-Portuguese"><a href="#Spanish-to-Portuguese" class="headerlink" title="Spanish to Portuguese"></a>Spanish to Portuguese</h3><p> Do you see now why the spoken forms are less mutually intelligible than the written forms?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135369/19272" target="_top" id="2135369">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135369" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135369/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Examples-of-Similarities-and-Differences-Between-Spanish-and-Portuguese"><a href="#Examples-of-Similarities-and-Differences-Between-Spanish-and-Portuguese" class="headerlink" title="Examples of Similarities and Differences Between Spanish and Portuguese"></a>Examples of Similarities and Differences Between Spanish and Portuguese</h2><p> Let’s look at some examples to help you better understand the similarities and differences between Spanish and Portuguese.</p><ul><li><strong>English:</strong> “Are there any interesting sights that we can visit?”</li><li><strong>Spanish:</strong> <em>¿Hay algún lugar interesante al que debamos ir?</em></li><li><strong>Portuguese:</strong> <em>Há algum lugar interessante que possamos visitar?</em></li><li><strong>English:</strong> “Where do you recommend I eat?”</li><li><strong>Spanish:</strong> <em>¿Dónde me recomiendas que coma?</em></li><li><strong>Portuguese:</strong> <em>Onde você me recomenda para comer?</em></li><li><strong>English:</strong> “I have booked a room.”</li><li><strong>Spanish:</strong> <em>He reservado una habitación.</em></li><li><strong>Portuguese:</strong> <em>Eu reservei um quarto.</em></li></ul><p> Quite similar, aren’t they? But remember: that does not make them the same language. Words like_información_ (Spanish) and_informação_ (Portuguese) or_carro_ (Spanish) and_carro_ (Portuguese) may look the same, but they sound different. While the Spanish_carro_ is pronounced the same way it is written (with the strong double_r)_ , in the Portuguese_carro,_  the double_rr_ is pronounced using what is known as a voiceless fricative or a guttural_r_ . So “r” is<strong>– only in some cases –</strong> the Portuguese equivalent of the Spanish “j” and are both pronounced using the “h” sound.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/themes/mondly/img/mondly-banner-icon.png"                      alt="mondly banner icon" title="Spanish And Portuguese: A Comparative Analysis 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012406/19272" target="_top" id="2012406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h5 id="Learn-both-Spanish-and-Portuguese-with-one-app"><a href="#Learn-both-Spanish-and-Portuguese-with-one-app" class="headerlink" title="Learn both Spanish and Portuguese with one app"></a>Learn both Spanish and Portuguese with one app</h5><p> Build practical language skills for real life with Mondly.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-4427&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-4427&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-4427&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-4427&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-4427&mt=8" >Start Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="False-Friends-Watch-Out-for-These-Tricky-Words"><a href="#False-Friends-Watch-Out-for-These-Tricky-Words" class="headerlink" title="False Friends: Watch Out for These Tricky Words"></a>False Friends: Watch Out for These Tricky Words</h2><p> Unsurprisingly, <strong>Spanish and Portuguese share a lot of <a class="link"   href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/cognate" >cognates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  (words from different languages that look and sound similar and even share the same meaning), but they also share a lot of “false friends” or false cognates (words that look and sound the same and might share a common origin, but have different meanings). So it would be best if you would not get ahead of yourself in trying to guess the meaning of a new word that looks similar to a word you already know. Crazy misunderstandings like being pregnant instead of being embarrassed can happen when you least expect it! _(If you are not familiar with this <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >cognate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -&gt; the Spanish “embarazada” is similar to the English “embarrassed”, but funnily enough, it translates to “pregnant” in English.) _</p><p> Here are some examples of the<strong>most common “false friends” from Spanish and Portuguese</strong> to help you avoid potentially embarrassing situations:</p><ul><li><strong><em>pelado</em></strong> translates to “skinned” or “peeled” in both languages but colloquially changes its meaning to “having a shaved <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >head or new haircut” in Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and “being naked” in Portuguese. You wouldn’t want to mix those two, wouldn’t you?</li><li>while in Spanish,<strong><em>largo</em></strong> means “long” and_ancho_ means “wide”; in Portuguese,<em>largo</em> means “wide” and_longo_ means “long”. That sounds like a headache, doesn’t it?</li><li><strong><em>polvo</em></strong> means “octopus” in Portuguese and “dust” in Spanish</li><li>you already know that the Spanish <em>(estar)<strong>embarazada</strong></em>  means “(to be) pregnant”.

Essentially, they are “linguistic cousins”. They often<strong>look similar and have the same or similar meanings.</strong> Since Portuguese and Spanish share nearly 90% of their vocabulary, there are a lot of such cognates between them. Here are a few examples:</p><p> Spanish-Portuguese Cognates</p><table><thead><tr><th>English</th><th>Spanish</th><th>Portuguese</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>water</td><td>agua</td><td>água</td></tr><tr><td>food</td><td>comida</td><td>comida</td></tr><tr><td>house</td><td>casa</td><td>casa</td></tr><tr><td>life</td><td>vida</td><td>vida</td></tr><tr><td>table</td><td>mesa</td><td>mesa</td></tr><tr><td>eyes</td><td>ojos</td><td>olhos</td></tr><tr><td>happy</td><td>contento</td><td>contente</td></tr><tr><td>sleep</td><td>dormir</td><td>dormir</td></tr><tr><td>attention</td><td>atención</td><td>atenção</td></tr><tr><td>city</td><td>ciudad</td><td>cidade</td></tr><tr><td>to love</td><td>amar</td><td>amar</td></tr><tr><td>to know</td><td>saber</td><td>saber</td></tr><tr><td>to be</td><td>ser</td><td>ser</td></tr><tr><td>to open</td><td>abrir</td><td>abrir</td></tr><tr><td>easy</td><td>fácil</td><td>fácil</td></tr><tr><td>book</td><td>libro</td><td>livro</td></tr><tr><td>flower</td><td>flor</td><td>flor</td></tr><tr><td>family</td><td>familia</td><td>família</td></tr><tr><td>together</td><td>juntos</td><td>junto</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Other-Notable-Differences"><a href="#Other-Notable-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Other Notable Differences"></a>Other Notable Differences</h2><p> At this point, we already settled that although very similar, Portuguese and Spanish are also different in terms of pronunciation and false cognates. Besides, there are also differences given by the area in which the language is spoken.<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Brazilian Portuguese is different from European Portuguese <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Latin American Spanish is different from European Spanish. And as we already mentioned, behind that, there are entire centuries of rich history and different influences. It’s nothing but fascinating!</p><p> But before you go, here are four more major differences between the two languages we should not overlook:</p><ul><li>while in Spanish both_yo_ and_me_ are used to express the singular form of the first person “I”, in Portuguese only_eu_ is used;</li><li><em>ñ</em> in the Spanish alphabet becomes_nh_ in Portuguese, so España or Spain is Espanha in Portuguese;</li><li>while in Spanish you have to use_muy_ before adverbs and adjectives and_mucho_ before a noun or after a verb, in Portuguese you just use_muito_ ;</li><li>while Portuguese speakers tend to use_a casa dela_ to express possession, the Spanish speakers just say_su casa_ as you probably already know from the well-known expression_Mi casa es su casa_ ;</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-Embrace-the-Similarities-and-Differences"><a href="#Conclusion-Embrace-the-Similarities-and-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion: Embrace the Similarities and Differences"></a>Conclusion: Embrace the Similarities and Differences</h2><p> The bottom line is that <strong>Spanish and Portuguese are indeed different but also quite similar.</strong> So, if you already speak Portuguese, learning Spanish will certainly become way easier and vice-versa. You’ll soon discover that even a small resemblance between words like <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >“hello” in Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >“hello” in Portuguese <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will make a huge difference in your learning process.</p><p> Recognizing and embracing the similarities and differences between Spanish and Portuguese can help us learn more about these languages and the cultures they come from. Both languages share some features but also have unique parts that make them special. Recognizing these parts helps us improve our knowledge of Spanish and Portuguese and grow our respect for their cultures.

Everywhere in the neighborhood smells like pumpkin pie, roasted chestnuts and mulled wine. Everyone is wearing warmer clothes and brighter smiles. Kids are carrying their heavy schoolbags back home to a delicious lunch and scary jack-o’-lanterns have begun popping up here and there. It’s glaringly obvious:<strong>Halloween is almost here!</strong> Soon enough houses will be covered in black and orange decorations and children will shout excitedly:<strong>“Trick or treat?! Give me something good to eat!”.</strong></p><h2 id="The-Origins-of-Halloween"><a href="#The-Origins-of-Halloween" class="headerlink" title="The Origins of Halloween"></a>The Origins of Halloween</h2><p> Celebrated yearly on October 31, Halloween, Hallowe’en or All Hallows’ Eve is a world-old holiday whose origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain that took place on the lands that are now Ireland, the United Kingdom, and northern France. For hundreds – or even thousands – of years, people have celebrated this holiday, but it was never as loved and as notorious as it is today.</p><p> Nevertheless, there are many countries around the world that have their own Halloween-like traditions celebrating the afterlife. For example, in some parts of the world, on All Hallows’ Eve, people visit the graveyards of their loved ones to pray and place flowers. But let’s dive in already and look at <strong>four of the most fascinating Halloween-like traditions from different corners of the world.</strong></p><h2 id="Halloween-like-Traditions-Worldwide"><a href="#Halloween-like-Traditions-Worldwide" class="headerlink" title="Halloween-like Traditions Worldwide"></a>Halloween-like Traditions Worldwide</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135406/19272" target="_top" id="2135406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Mexico-Dia-de-Muertos-Day-of-the-Dead"><a href="#Mexico-Dia-de-Muertos-Day-of-the-Dead" class="headerlink" title="Mexico: Día de Muertos (Day of the Dead)"></a>Mexico: Día de Muertos (Day of the Dead)</h3><p> Inscribed in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity,<em>Día de los Muertos</em> is celebrated yearly on October 31, November 1, and November 2 to coincide with the celebration the Allhallowtide: All Saints’ Eve, All Saints’ Day, and All Souls’ Day.</p><p> The same as Halloween,<em>Día de Muertos</em> is a celebration of the afterlife. Friends and family gather to remember and pray for their loved ones who have died. Mexicans view death as a natural part of the human cycle and praying for someone who has died as a way of helping them in their spiritual journey. So Día de Muertos is not a day of sadness, but one of celebration and color!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/dia-de-muertos-960x639.jpg"                      alt="Colorful ofrendas and calaveras during Día de Muertos in Mexico" title="Global Halloween Celebrations: From Día De Muertos To Romania&#39;S St. Andrew&#39;S Day 6"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137228/26400" target="_top" id="2137228">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137228" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137228/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> “Calaveras” by Valeria Almaraz©</p><p> As you probably already know, the main symbols of <a href="https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/indigenous-festivity-dedicated-to-the-dead-00054"><em>Día de Muertos</em></a> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofrenda"><em>ofrendas</em></a> (altars),<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calavera"><em>calaveras</em></a> (representations of a human skull often applied to edible or decorative skulls) and people wearing the colorful_calaveras_ makeup known all over the world.

For example, Italy has_Tutti i Morti,_ a public day celebrated on the 1st and 2nd of November by remembering and praying for the deceased.</p><p> A few days before the celebration, people visit the cemeteries so their loved ones will have fresh flowers on the grave on the day of the actual ceremonies. Then, they continue with all the other preparations involving different rituals depending on the region.

In Sicily, children wake up on the morning of_Giorno dei Morti_ and find small gifts from their deceased relatives, in Abruzzo, children go door to door to ask for gifts for the souls of the dead and in Veneto, the carved pumpkins are called lumère (lanterns) or_suche dei morti_ (deads’ pumpkins) and represent the resurrection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/neonbrand-A59lWOrZVnw-unsplash-1024x682.jpg"                      alt="halloween in different countries" title="Global Halloween Celebrations: From Día De Muertos To Romania&#39;S St. Andrew&#39;S Day 8"                ></p><p> “Halloween party” by NeONBRAND©</p><p> Contrary to what you may believe, pumpkins and asking for candy and gifts are traditions of the past that were popular in many Italian regions before the American Halloween became so notorious.</p><h3 id="Romania-Saint-Andrew’s-Day"><a href="#Romania-Saint-Andrew’s-Day" class="headerlink" title="Romania: Saint Andrew’s Day"></a>Romania: Saint Andrew’s Day</h3><p> Thanks to Dracula, Romania is now one of the most well-known Halloween destinations. Everyone dreams of partying at Dracula’s Castle. In reality, both Catholic and Orthodox churches in Romania discourage Halloween celebrations. Instead, they advocate for the celebrations of the Day of the Dead on 1 November, when special religious ceremonies are held for the souls of the deceased.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/draculas-castle-1024x682.jpg"                      alt="dracula&#39;s castle" title="Global Halloween Celebrations: From Día De Muertos To Romania&#39;S St. Andrew&#39;S Day 9"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137206/26400" target="_top" id="2137206">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137206" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137206/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> “Dracula’s Castle in Romania” by Nomadic Julien©</p><p> It is said that on St. Andrew’s Eve, ghosts roam freely between the living and people must protect their homes using garlic, a symbol that is now also related to scaring off vampires. Thus, to this day, especially old people from the countryside, rub the doors and the windows with garlic to keep the bad spirits away.</p><p><strong>Did You Know?</strong></p><p> <em>Saint Andrew, for whom this day is named, is also the patron saint of Romania, Greece, and Russia. Each country has distinct customs and traditions to honor him.</em></p><p> The same as in other cultures, Romanians bring fresh flowers to the graves of their loved ones, go to the church to attend special ceremonies and offer food and drinks as it is believed the deceased can enjoy them in “The Other World”.</p><p> As October comes to an end, it’s evident that the spirit of Halloween, or the remembrance of the departed, resonates across cultures. While the customs might vary, the core sentiment remains consistent: honoring those who’ve passed and celebrating the mysteries of the afterlife</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/halloween-around-the-world/&t=Global+Halloween+Celebrations:+From+D%C3%ADa+de+Muertos+to+Romania%5C&%23039;s+St.+Andrew%5C&%23039;s+Day"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h4 id="Learn-a-new-language-and-celebrate-Halloween-abroad-this-year"><a href="#Learn-a-new-language-and-celebrate-Halloween-abroad-this-year" class="headerlink" title="Learn a new language and celebrate Halloween abroad this year"></a>Learn a new language and celebrate Halloween abroad this year</h4><p> Do you want to experience the magic of Halloween abroad?
