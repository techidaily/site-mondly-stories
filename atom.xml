This is not a matter of culture, but rather a matter of international common sense. It doesn’t matter if you are a French man in Romania or an American woman in Sweden. Common sense translates the same in all languages. How to say “thank you” in different languages should probably be included in students’ curricula at school. Expressing your gratitude is as important as expressing your love.</p><p> Besides, this has everything to do with first impressions. As Will Rogers (American stage and motion picture actor) once said: “You never get a second chance to make a first impression”. So you have to make it count from the first try. We are people. We tend to automatically judge. We only need 30 seconds to make a full semiotic analysis of someone we’ve just met. That’s it! 30 seconds for an impression that may last a lifetime. If you travel to a foreign country, making that good first impression may mean to say<strong>“thank you” in Spanish</strong> (“gracias”). That doesn’t sound that hard to do, isn’t it?</p><h2 id="How-to-say-“thank-you”-in-30-languages"><a href="#How-to-say-“thank-you”-in-30-languages" class="headerlink" title="How to say “thank you” in 30 languages"></a>How to say “thank you” in 30 languages</h2><ul><li><strong>Thank you in Afrikaans:</strong> <em>Dankie</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Arabic:</strong> <em>شكرا لك</em> (<em>“Shukran lak”</em> for males;<em>“Shukran laki”</em> for females)</li><li><strong>Thank you in Bulgarian:</strong> <em>Благодаря (Blagodarya)</em></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Thank you in Chinese <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> :</strong> _谢谢你 (Xièxiè nǐ) _</li><li><strong>Thank you in Croatian:</strong> <em>Hvala</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Czech:</strong> <em>Děkuji</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Danish:</strong> <em>Tak</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Dutch:</strong> <em>Dank u</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Finnish:</strong> <em>Kiitos</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in French:</strong> <em>Merci</em></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Thank you in German <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> :</strong> <em>Danke</em></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Thank you in Greek <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> :</strong> _Ευχαριστώ (Efcharistó) _</li><li><strong>Thank you in Hebrew:</strong> <em>תודה (Toda)</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Hindi:</strong> <em>धन्यवाद (Dhanyavaad)</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Hungarian:</strong> <em>Köszönöm</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Indonesian:</strong> <em>Terima kasih</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Italian:</strong> <em>Grazie</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Japanese:</strong> <em>ありがとうございます (Arigatō gozaimasu)</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Korean:</strong> <em>감사합니다 (Gamsahabnida)</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Norwegian:</strong> <em>Takk</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Persian:</strong> <em>سپاسگزارم (Sepaas gozaaram)</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Polish:</strong> <em>Dziękuję</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Portuguese:</strong> <em>Obrigado</em> (for males);<em>Obrigada</em> (for females)</li><li><strong>Thank you in Romanian:</strong> <em>Mulţumesc</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Russian:</strong> <em>Спасибо (Spasibo)</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Spanish:</strong> <em>Gracias</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Swedish:</strong> <em>Tack</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Thai:</strong> <em>ขอบคุณ (Kòp kun)</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Turkish:</strong> <em>Teşekkürler</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Ukrainian:</strong> <em>Дякую (Dyakuyu)</em></li><li><strong>Thank you in Vietnamese:</strong> <em>Cảm ơn</em></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-to-say-thank-you.jpg"                      alt="how to say thank you" title="How To Say Thank You In 30 Different Languages 2"                ></p><p> “Thanks” by Hanny Naibaho©</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148644/16836" target="_top" id="2148644">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148644" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148644/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-origin-of-saying-“thank-you”"><a href="#The-origin-of-saying-“thank-you”" class="headerlink" title="The origin of saying “thank you”"></a>The origin of saying “thank you”</h2><p> The mere act of expressing gratitude sits at the core of human interaction, so it should be interesting to analyze it a bit more. As the <a class="link"   href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/thank%5Fyou" >Oxford Dictionaries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> explain, “thank you” is “a polite expression used when acknowledging a gift, service, or compliment, or accepting or refusing an offer”. “Thank you” is basically the general expression of gratitude or politeness to someone for an act of kindness that he or she has done.</p><p> But what is the origin of this expression? <a class="link"   href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/thank--you" >Online sources <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  claim that in Old English “thank you” had the form <em>þancian</em> “to give thanks” – a word that originated from Proto-Germanic_thankojan_ (similar to Old Saxon_thancon_ , Old Norse_þakka_ , Danish_takke_ , Old Frisian_thankia_ , German_danken_ – “to thank”). But all this was also derived from the original_thankoz_ which meant “thought, gratitude,” from the Proto-Indo-European root_tong_ – “to think, feel”. In short, that means that “thank you” is actually derived from the verb “to think”! So people used to express their gratitude differently in the past. If we were to paraphrase its meaning, we could say “because of what you have done for me, I think favorably of you”.</p><p> Naturally, there are many other languages in which this expression has transitioned through other forms before settling to its present one. Here are only a few examples:</p><p><strong>–</strong> <strong>Thank you in Portuguese</strong> <em>(obrigado&#x2F;obrigada)</em> – originates from the past participle of the Latin_obligō_ (“I bind in obligation”)</p><p><strong>–</strong> <strong>Thank you in French</strong> –<em>merci</em> – originates from the Latin_mercēs_ that means “wages, payment, reward”</p><p><strong>–</strong> <strong>Thank you in Spanish</strong> <em>(gracias)</em> and<strong>thank you in Italian</strong> <em>(grazie)</em> are quite similar so it’s no surprise they originate from the same Latin expression –<em>gratias agere</em> – which simply means “to express gratitude”</p><p><strong>–</strong> <strong>Thank you in Japanese</strong> (<em>arigatō gozaimasu</em> or simply_arigatō_ for “thanks) – originates from_arikatashi_ where “ari” is a verb meaning “to be” and “katashi” is an adjective meaning “difficult”. The original meaning of “arigatashi” was “difficult to be”. Put into a context, that would mean that someone’s generosity or behavior is “rare” and thus “special”.</p><p> Now that you know how to say “thank you” in 30 languages, take a step further and learn <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >how to say “I love you” in 30 languages. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/how-to-say-thank-you-in-30-different-languages/&t=How+to+Say+Thank+You+in+30+Different+Languages"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934254/19272" target="_top" id="1934254">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934254" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934254/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="From-0-to-conversational-in-over-40-languages"><a href="#From-0-to-conversational-in-over-40-languages" class="headerlink" title="From 0 to conversational in over 40 languages"></a>From 0 to conversational in over 40 languages</h2><p> Do you want to speak Spanish fluently fast?

If you think about it, there’s hardly a day that passes without using any numbers. When learning a new language – Russian in your case – learning how to count is just as important as learning <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >how to say “hello” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . So if you’re planning a trip to a <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Russian-speaking country <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , learning the Russian numbers is a must.</p><p> Whether you need to find out what’s the price for a matryoshka, ask a stranger when is the next bus arriving or give someone your phone number, knowing the Russian numbers is definitely essential. On top of that, they are not even that hard to learn. Once you learn how to count to ten, counting to 100 is a piece of cake.</p><h2 id="Russian-numbers-1-10"><a href="#Russian-numbers-1-10" class="headerlink" title="Russian numbers 1-10"></a>Russian numbers 1-10</h2><p> In order to understand the logic behind counting in Russian faster, it’s best to break down the information into multiple sections. As you may expect, the Russian numbers from 1 to 10 are the most important. Not only these are the ones you’ll probably use the most, but they also lay the foundations for the bigger numbers in Russian.</p><p> Here are the numbers from 1 to 10 in Russian with their respective pronunciations so you can begin practicing right now:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/russian-numbers-1-10-600x424.jpg"                      alt="russian numbers 1-10" title="Russian Numbers - Learn How To Count In Russian 2"                ></p><p> Russian numbers 1-10</p><p><strong>Good to know:</strong> when the numbers один (“one”) and два (“two”) are put before a noun, they can change their form according to the gender of the noun thus:</p><ul><li>masculine: один <em>(odin)</em> ; два <em>(dva)</em></li><li>feminine: одна <em>(odna)</em> ; две <em>(dve)</em></li><li>neuter: одно <em>(odno)</em> ; два <em>(dva)</em></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134491/18498" target="_top" id="2134491">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134491" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134491/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Learn-how-to-count-to-20-in-Russian"><a href="#Learn-how-to-count-to-20-in-Russian" class="headerlink" title="Learn how to count to 20 in Russian"></a>Learn how to count to 20 in Russian</h2><p> Did you manage to learn the Russian pronunciation for the first ten numbers?

Let’s be serious. ‘Obsessed’ is a light word. If BTS made me think about learning Korean, Squid Game outright bought my subscription to <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-6194&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6194?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ko&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6194?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ko" >learn Korean <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> It’s Netflix’s biggest ever series launch and it’s bloody… splendid. The world loves it. In fact, people love it so much that more and more of them want to learn Korean. It’s not just me or just you. It’s the whole world. Squid Game literally took the world by storm.</p><p> The only problem is that the meaning of some scenes in Squid Game seems to have been changed by subtitles. Ever since the show’s official release in September, Korean-speaking fans have been sharing Squid Game mistranslations all over Twitter and TikTok.</p><p>So what’s there to be done?</p><p> Easy. What everybody else has been doing:<strong>learn Korean and never get lost in translation ever again.</strong></p><h2 id="There’s-an-entire-‘Korean-wave’-behind-Squid-Game-Parasite-and-BTS"><a href="#There’s-an-entire-‘Korean-wave’-behind-Squid-Game-Parasite-and-BTS" class="headerlink" title="There’s an entire ‘Korean wave’ behind Squid Game, Parasite and BTS"></a>There’s an entire ‘Korean wave’ behind Squid Game, Parasite and BTS</h2><p> This is not the first time Korean culture blew our minds. If you haven’t lived under a rock, you already know that there’s so much more to it. Just two years ago, we marveled at the brilliance of Parasite, the Korean masterpiece that won four Oscars.</p><p> Then there’s also BTS, the South Korean boy band also known as the Bangtan Boys. When I wrote about the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Korean alphabet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , many people commented on how much they loved their music. Dubbed ‘Princes of Pop’, the BTS members are the youngest ever to receive the Order of Cultural Merit from the South Korean President due to their contributions in spreading the Korean language and culture.</p><p> The list could go on and on with the <strong>fascinating craze around Korean skincare products, the K-dramas, the K-pop songs and the Korean comics also known as manhwa.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/squid-game-korean-960x539.jpg"                      alt="squid game korean netflix" title="Obsessed With Squid Game, But Lost In Translation? Learn Korean 5"                ></p><p> ‘Squid Game on Netflix’ by Jonas Augustin©</p><p> So with Squid Game, all that the Korean culture did was to prove once again its hypnotic power over us. If you think about it, this is a whole new world beyond our own. Beyond the pop culture we already know. A whole new world we’re all eager to explore. For me, it’s all about the movies. My passion for cinema has never been the same again after watching the Korean film Oldboy. And this is just an example. Korean cinema is more than rich in masterpieces.</p><p> Now, this global phenomenon even has its own name. <strong>The cultural boom coming from South Korea since the 1990s is known today as the Korean wave or <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean%5Fwave" >hallyu <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</strong> Basically, everything we love about Korean pop culture is embedded in hallyu.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027176/19272" target="_top" id="2027176">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027176" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027176/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Squid-Game-got-lost-in-translation"><a href="#Why-Squid-Game-got-lost-in-translation" class="headerlink" title="Why Squid Game got lost in translation"></a>Why Squid Game got lost in translation</h2><p> Not everyone will get this, but can you imagine how sad it is to be lost in translation without Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray?</p><p> Jokes aside, we all know translation has its risks. If you’re not in the know with the <a class="link"   href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58787264" >news <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Korean-speaking fans of Squid Game claim that the closed-caption subtitles in English are ‘so bad’ that the original meaning is often lost.</p><p> So something amazing happened. The English subtitles were mistranslated here and there, but the world still loves Squid Game. Now imagine how even more awesome the hit show could have been with the right subtitles. Or if people knew Korean themselves and didn’t need subtitles at all. Fascinating thought.</p><p> The question remains: if not even Netflix, the billion-dollar streaming service, could offer viewers a top-notch translation from Korean, then who can?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/learn-korean-960x640.jpg"                      alt="korean culture" title="Obsessed With Squid Game, But Lost In Translation?

The Squid Game situation became notorious due to the show’s popularity, but this is not an isolated case. You may not be aware, but many other foreign-language movies and series are facing the same problem. Because of length and cultural particularities, subtitles can never be 100% accurate.</p><p>So there’s only one conclusion we can draw from this…</p><p><strong>Like Thanos, getting lost in translation is inevitable.</strong></p><h2 id="Learn-Korean-and-overcome-the-one-inch-tall-barrier-of-subtitles"><a href="#Learn-Korean-and-overcome-the-one-inch-tall-barrier-of-subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Learn Korean and overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles"></a>Learn Korean and overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles</h2><p> It’s amazing how people learn languages for love. There’s no greater drive than love. And I’m not talking just about romantic love. The fact that so many people are learning Korean after they watched Squid Game, it’s an act of love. All these people learn Korean out of love for this show. Others have been learning the language out of love for BTS. You could even go so far as to say that love makes us smarter.

You get frustrated. A lot"></a>1. You get frustrated. A lot</h2><p> If your name is not Harry Potter, chances are you won’t magically wake up one day knowing a foreign language. So, dating someone who doesn’t speak English can get really frustrating sometimes. Especially in the beginning, things can get really complicated because you are never sure if you got them right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/CmqNynXoenYnm/giphy.gif"                      alt="dating a foreigner" title="10 Relatable Situations You&#39;Ll Understand Only If You Ever Dated A Foreigner 3"                ></p><p> And it’s all fun and games until someone asks, “what are you thinking about?”. If answering this mythical question was hard before, imagine how challenging it becomes now that you are dating someone with bad English or no English at all. So take it from me and don’t go there! Abort mission! Practice some more and only then you’ll be ready for this quest. But you knew that already, didn’t you?</p><h2 id="2-You-never-run-out-of-things-to-say-to-each-other"><a href="#2-You-never-run-out-of-things-to-say-to-each-other" class="headerlink" title="2. You never run out of things to say to each other"></a>2. You never run out of things to say to each other</h2><p> On the other hand, you never ever run out of things to say to each other in a multilingual relationship. That’s because both of you are constantly trying to teach the other your native tongue.</p><p>“Spoon! This is a spoon! Repeat after me! Spoon!” – sounds familiar?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/AelF2ps5xLKo/giphy.gif"                      alt="multilingual relantionship" title="10 Relatable Situations You&#39;Ll Understand Only If You Ever Dated A Foreigner 4"                ></p><p> You either go through the entire dictionary or use the brilliance of Mondly to learn the language before one can say Jack Robinson.</p><h2 id="3-You-deal-with-a-lot-of-unfortunate-translations"><a href="#3-You-deal-with-a-lot-of-unfortunate-translations" class="headerlink" title="3. You deal with a lot of unfortunate translations"></a>3. You deal with a lot of unfortunate translations</h2><p> Overcoming language barriers in a relationship can be hard when there’s no humor involved. So don’t hesitate to make the most of your funny and unfortunate translations! For example, if you are flirting and there’s a <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Spanish language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> barrier between you two, don’t forget that “molestar” actually means “to annoy” in Spanish and not “to molest” (hahaha!).</p><p> The same goes with “embarazada”! “Embarazada” means “pregnant” in Spanish and not “embarrassed” – as one might think. So be careful with that one! Really tricky!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xUA7aYMO79CzQNMfJe/giphy.gif"                      alt="dating language barrier" title="10 Relatable Situations You&#39;Ll Understand Only If You Ever Dated A Foreigner 5"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047346/19272" target="_top" id="2047346">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047346" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047346/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134501/19576" target="_top" id="2134501">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134501" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134501/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-You-eventually-become-bilingual"><a href="#4-You-eventually-become-bilingual" class="headerlink" title="4.

If love is strong, so is your desire to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn a new language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

The idea of meeting “the friends” suddenly becomes way more intimidating"></a>6. The idea of meeting “the friends” suddenly becomes way more intimidating</h2><p> That’s especially true if you are in a long-distance relationship with the language barrier tangled in your romance to make it tougher. That daunting moment when you know you have to meet his or her foreign friends is only maybe surpassed by meeting the parents.</p><p> Good Lord! It sends shivers down my spine only when I think of it. Good luck with that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/12nfFCZA0vyrSw/giphy.gif"                      alt="overcoming language barriers" title="10 Relatable Situations You&#39;Ll Understand Only If You Ever Dated A Foreigner 6"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135353/19272" target="_top" id="2135353">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135353" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135353/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-You-come-up-with-a-sign-language-of-your-own"><a href="#7-You-come-up-with-a-sign-language-of-your-own" class="headerlink" title="7.

They are actually the absolute and ultimate cure for overthinking. “What did he or she mean by that?” becomes “well, I can’t put up with all that thinking now.

So<strong>what language did Vikings speak</strong> after all?<strong>The short answer is Old Norse,</strong> but the real answer is much more complicated than that.</p><p> The Vikings were a group of seafaring warriors who lived in Scandinavia (and beyond) during the Viking Age. They left a lasting impact on history and the stories about their raids, trade, and exploration continue to fascinate us to this day. Considering that the Viking age spanned over centuries and encompassed multiple territories across Northern Europe, it’s safe to say that<strong>Vikings couldn’t have spoken just one language.</strong> Let’s see why’s that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/rR6m3deXOpHP2/giphy.gif"                      alt="viking ragnar" title="What Language Did Vikings Speak? 2"                ></p><h2 id="Did-Vikings-speak-Old-English"><a href="#Did-Vikings-speak-Old-English" class="headerlink" title="Did Vikings speak Old English?"></a>Did Vikings speak Old English?</h2><p> First, let’s address the elephant in the room.<strong>Did Vikings speak English?</strong> No, Modern English didn’t even exist at the time. As pop culture explores the Viking age more and more, it’s only natural that you’d ask yourself that. After all, Ragnar Lothbrok did speak English fluently in the acclaimed TV show_Vikings_ .</p><p> Now, if you’re wondering whether Vikings spoke_Old_ English – that’s an entirely different question. The people living in England did speak a different dialect of Old English at the time. And what we know from both history and History Channel (the television network that produced_Vikings_) is that England was one of the first countries to be raided by Vikings. In fact, the Viking Age is said to have commenced with the attack of the Lindisfarne Abbey on 8 June 793 CE. The abbey was located on an island off the northeast coast of England in Northumberland.</p><p> So<strong>did Vikings speak Old English?</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/V5474zfp6NveE/giphy.gif"                      alt="Vikings english" title="What Language Did Vikings Speak? 3"                ></p><p> To tell you the truth, Vikings did not typically speak Old English. Old English was spoken by the Anglo-Saxons, who lived in England at the same time as the Vikings. However, <strong>it is possible that some Vikings who settled in England may have learned to speak Old English.</strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134496/18498" target="_top" id="2134496">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134496" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134496/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-language-did-Vikings-speak"><a href="#What-language-did-Vikings-speak" class="headerlink" title="What language did Vikings speak?"></a>What language did Vikings speak?</h2><p><strong>Old Norse</strong> is the obvious answer for most Vikings. However, even in present days, languages spanning over large territories can’t possibly be entirely homogeneous.</p><p> Moreover, given the extensive duration of the Viking age and its prevalence across numerous Northern European nations and beyond, it is incorrect to suggest that there was only one “Viking language”. Instead, there were various languages spoken by the Vikings. The languages these seafaring warriors spoke depended largely on their location, timeframe and identity.</p><p> Because Vikings were travelers, it is safe to assume they were multilingual. In some instances, Vikings spoke both Old Norse and the language of their relocated territory. Everywhere they went, Vikings brought their language with them. This is how, over generations, Old Norse influenced and blended with local languages. Place names in Britain and numerous other words stand proof of this.</p><p> In spite of everything,<strong>Old Norse is still considered the primary Viking language.</strong> If you watched_The Northman_ , you must have heard it in songs and ritual settings. Apparently, they didn’t have the budget to make the entire movie in Old Norse. It does sound fittingly Viking, doesn’t it?</p><h3 id="Old-Norse-the-Viking-language"><a href="#Old-Norse-the-Viking-language" class="headerlink" title="Old Norse: the Viking language"></a>Old Norse: the Viking language</h3><p> By the 8th century, Proto-Norse (which was spoken in Scandinavia and its Nordic settlements) developed into Old Norse – also known as Old Nordic or Old Scandinavian. This was the phase in the evolution of North Germanic dialects that occurred prior to their ultimate divergence into the distinct Nordic languages we know today.</p><p> Although Old Norse is recognized as a single language, there were discernible dialects that varied between regions such as Denmark and Iceland. Nonetheless, individuals from these regions could presumably still comprehend one another. The three main dialects were:</p><ul><li><strong>Old West Norse</strong> — originated from the Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian languages, and was spoken in several places, including the British Isles, Norway, and Normandy.</li><li><strong>Old East Norse</strong> — was spoken in Sweden, Denmark, and as far east as Russia.</li><li><strong>Old Gutnish</strong> — was a dialect spoken on the Swedish island of Gotland and had its roots in the Gothic language, which is now an extinct East Germanic language.</li></ul><p> As previously mentioned, these three dialects of Old Norse formed the foundation for modern Scandinavian languages: Danish,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Swedish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Norwegian <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Faroese and Icelandic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/viking-language-960x640.jpg"                      alt="&#39;Viking language&#39; by Hannah Grapp©" title="What Language Did Vikings Speak? 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137218/26400" target="_top" id="2137218">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137218" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137218/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1030380/11832" target="_top" id="1030380">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1030380" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1030380/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-language-today-is-closest-to-Old-Norse"><a href="#What-language-today-is-closest-to-Old-Norse" class="headerlink" title="What language today is closest to Old Norse?"></a>What language today is closest to Old Norse?</h2><p> <strong>Modern Icelandic is widely regarded as the Nordic language that most closely resembles Old Norse.</strong> In fact, the writing system is so similar that Icelandic speakers can read Old Norse texts with relative ease. Some specialists compare the likeness between modern Icelandic and Old Norse to that of Shakespearean English and present-day English. Old West Norse is the direct ancestor of Icelandic, and many surviving Old Norse manuscripts originated from Iceland. Consequently, Old West Norse is the most commonly taught variant of Old Norse at present.</p><p>So yeah, you can learn Old Norse if you want to.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144284/7443" target="_top" id="2144284">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144284" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144284/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-Old-Norse-still-spoken"><a href="#Is-Old-Norse-still-spoken" class="headerlink" title="Is Old Norse still spoken?"></a>Is Old Norse still spoken?</h2><p> Old Norse is not spoken as a living language today. However, there are people who study Old Norse and speak it fluently.</p><p> As noted previously, modern Icelandic is the most similar modern language to Old Norse. For this reason, it is considered that spending time with Icelanders can offer a glimpse into this ancient language’s contemporary iteration.</p><p> Furthermore, Old Norse is still with us through the multitude of words that were borrowed into English. Some examples of Old Norse words in English are gift (<em>gift</em>), husband (<em>húsbóndi</em>), cake (<em>kaka</em>), egg (<em>egg</em>), anger (<em>angr</em>), arm (<em>armr</em>). And these are just a few. The list could go on for a while.</p><h2 id="What-language-did-Vikings-write-in"><a href="#What-language-did-Vikings-write-in" class="headerlink" title="What language did Vikings write in?"></a>What language did Vikings write in?</h2><p> Scandinavians used the Elder Futhark 24-letter alphabet to write their language until the 8th century. Then, as the Viking age began, they adopted the Young Futhark. This was a simplified runic alphabet consisting of just 16 letters.</p><p> Fun fact: it seems that their decision to adopt the new writing system complicated things for researchers as it became harder to interpret runes due to the letter combinations.</p><p> In the 11th century, as Christianity was adopted, so was the Roman alphabet. It’s possible that some Vikings learned the alphabet during their voyages to other parts of Europe, either for trading or raiding purposes. The Young Futhark and the Roman alphabet coexisted for a considerable length of time before the latter eventually took over completely.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/what-language-did-vikings-speak/&t=What+Language+Did+Vikings+Speak?"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="Learn-the-Scandinavian-languages-fast"><a href="#Learn-the-Scandinavian-languages-fast" class="headerlink" title="Learn the Scandinavian languages fast"></a>Learn the Scandinavian languages fast</h3><p> While the original language of the Vikings is not around anymore, you can always learn the modern Scandinavian languages.

Even as a child, when you started speaking your native language, you started with “mom”, “dad”,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >“hello” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , then you probably learned the parts of the body, how to count to ten, the colors and – naturally – the days of the week. Otherwise, how would you have been able to set up meetings with the other cool toddlers in the park? The days of the week are crucial for every toddler! 😂</p><p> But no more talking. Let’s dive in and find out how to say Monday in Spanish.</p><h2 id="The-days-of-the-week-in-Spanish"><a href="#The-days-of-the-week-in-Spanish" class="headerlink" title="The days of the week in Spanish"></a>The days of the week in Spanish</h2><p> Show 10 25 50 100  entries</p><p> Search:</p><table><thead><tr><th>English</th><th>Spanish</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Monday</td><td>lunes</td></tr><tr><td>Tuesday</td><td>martes</td></tr><tr><td>Wednesday</td><td>miércoles</td></tr><tr><td>Thursday</td><td>jueves</td></tr><tr><td>Friday</td><td>viernes</td></tr><tr><td>Saturday</td><td>sábado</td></tr><tr><td>Sunday</td><td>domingo</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Showing 1 to 7 of 7 entries</p><p> Previous  Next</p><p> Before you can say that that’s easy peasy lemon squeezy, let’s look at some rules:</p><ul><li><strong>days of the week are not capitalized in Spanish</strong> – unless, of course, they appear at the beginning of a sentence;</li><li><strong>days of the week are all masculine in Spanish</strong> – this means you’ll always have to use masculine articles –<em>el</em> ,<em>los</em> ,<em>un</em> and_algunos –_ and masculine adjectives when talking about the days of the week. For example, if you want to say “the last Friday of the month was rainy” in Spanish, you say “<strong>el</strong> últim<strong>o</strong> viernes del mes fue lluvios<strong>o</strong> ”;</li><li><strong>“on Monday” in Spanish can’t be translated verbatim</strong> – for example, “I will pay you a visit on Monday” translates to “te haré una visita<strong>el</strong> lunes” in Spanish. Although you could be tempted to say “en”, don’t do it! The only correct way to talk about something happening on a specific day in Spanish is by using the pronouns_el_ and_los_ (e.g. “she visits her grandma every Sunday” will translate to “ella visita a su abuela todos<strong>los</strong> domingos”)</li><li><strong>to make a day of the week plural, you add an_s_</strong>  (if it doesn’t already end in one) – this means_lunes_ will remain_lunes_ for the plural form_los lunes_ , but_domingo_ will become_domingos_ –<em>los domingos.</em> In other words, the only days that get an_s_ for their plural form are_sábado_ and_domingo_ :<em>sábados y domingos.</em></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/spanish-days-of-the-week.png"                      alt="spanish days of the week" title="Monday To Domingo - Learn The Days Of The Week In Spanish 2"                ></p><p> The days of the week in Spanish in a nutshell.</p><p>And only now you’re free to say that that was easy peasy lemon squeezy!</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/monday-to-domingo-learn-the-days-of-the-week-in-spanish/&t=Monday+to+Domingo+%E2%80%93+Learn+the+Days+of+the+Week+in+Spanish"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868499/19272" target="_top" id="1868499">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868499" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868499/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Speak-Spanish-in-just-10-minutes-a-day"><a href="#Speak-Spanish-in-just-10-minutes-a-day" class="headerlink" title="Speak Spanish in just 10 minutes a day"></a>Speak Spanish in just 10 minutes a day</h3><p> Do you want to see_los días de la semana_ in action?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Linguistic-Ladder-Top-Reasons-to-Climb-Another-Language-Level"><a href="#Linguistic-Ladder-Top-Reasons-to-Climb-Another-Language-Level" class="headerlink" title="Linguistic Ladder: Top Reasons to Climb Another Language Level"></a>Linguistic Ladder: Top Reasons to Climb Another Language Level</h2><p> Learning a foreign language can literally change your life: increase your self-esteem, jumpstart your professional life and more. Despite this, it is something that most people only pursue if relocation or other life circumstances require it. This is a shame because developing an understanding of languages offers a wide array of benefits. You might think that knowing a foreign language is only necessary when interacting with a person who speaks that language. However, the very act of becoming multilingual can improve your life in ways you can’t even imagine.</p><h2 id="Improve-your-life-enjoy-amazing-new-opportunities-by-learning-a-foreign-language"><a href="#Improve-your-life-enjoy-amazing-new-opportunities-by-learning-a-foreign-language" class="headerlink" title="Improve your life: enjoy amazing new opportunities by learning a foreign language"></a><strong>Improve your life: enjoy amazing new opportunities by learning a foreign language</strong></h2><p><strong>1. Communicate with people all over the world</strong></p><p> Many people assume that English is the most commonly used language on Earth, but that isn’t the case. It’s true that many countries around the globe cater to English speakers, especially in business and travel hubs. However, Mandarin is the most spoken language,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the third and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >French <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the 18th. In total, they count for 1.5 billion speakers worldwide representing over 21% of the global population. Learning either of these languages will be a major boost to your ability to communicate internationally.</p><p><strong>2. Develop new career options</strong></p><p> The fact that learning a foreign language can help your career is a major selling point for many people. Whether you’re an entrepreneur looking to become the next global household name or simply someone who travels a lot for work, being multilingual could create new possibilities for you.</p><p><strong>3. Climb the ladder in your chosen career</strong></p><p> Maybe you don’t want to seek out new career options but would rather move up within your current company. If so, adding new skills to your resume is an excellent way to convince your superiors that you’re ready. It doesn’t matter what sort of work you do. Almost all jobs require you to interact with others, and there might be times that those you interact with speak a foreign language.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/pexels-photo-29642-scaled.jpg"                      alt="pexels photo 29642 scaled" title="Top 10 Reasons Why You Should Learn A Foreign Language This Year 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012420/19272" target="_top" id="2012420">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012420" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012420/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Sharpen-your-thinking-experience-unexpected-benefits-by-becoming-multilingual"><a href="#Sharpen-your-thinking-experience-unexpected-benefits-by-becoming-multilingual" class="headerlink" title="Sharpen your thinking: experience unexpected benefits by becoming multilingual"></a><strong>Sharpen your thinking: experience unexpected benefits by becoming multilingual</strong></h2><p><strong>4. Expand your mind</strong></p><p> Language is a habit. Every day, we practice our native language. Not only is this true while we are actively engaging with others, but also when we are contemplating things on our own. Can you envision what it would be like to think in a foreign language? Polyglots often realize that they are different people when speaking a foreign language. They have a different personality, a different voice. That’s why learning a new language life-changing experiment with the potential of showing you a different side of you. Aren’t you curious about discovering your alternate personalities? With so many languages you can learn there are tens of different sides of you. Why not give it a try now. It only takes a few minutes to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn the most common Spanish words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><strong>5. Slow the aging process</strong></p><p> Learning new things can help your brain stay active as you age. It’s never too late to learn something new, especially if it can sharpen your thinking. In fact, research has shown that older adults are equipped to learn foreign languages, and doing so can help slow the aging process. While it’s true that young children learn a language the easiest, with a little effort, an older adult can become fluent as well. As you grow, learn and continue to expand your mind, you may notice an increase in mental sharpness. You can start by looking over some <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >popular French phrases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><strong>6. Cultivate creativity</strong></p><p> Challenging your mind can increase your creativity as much as it improves your memory. An active mind is a creative mind. When you teach your brain to do something differently, it will begin exploring in other ways as well. If you’re creative minded but have found yourself in a bit of a funk the past few years, learning a new language might provide you with the boost you need.</p><p><strong>7. Develop a better understanding of your own language</strong></p><p> Exposing yourself to a fresh style of speech and language structure can help you gain a better understanding of your native language as well. Often, children learn English through memorization and practice rather than having a deep understanding of the structure of the language itself. Speaking in a foreign language helps you notice these differences in structure and gain a better understanding of how your own language functions. This is ideal for writers or other professionals who would like to improve their native skills on top of learning the new language.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/pexels-photo-89873-scaled.jpeg"                      alt="pexels photo 89873 scaled" title="Top 10 Reasons Why You Should Learn A Foreign Language This Year 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049363/7443" target="_top" id="2049363">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049363" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049363/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/798161/11305" target="_top" id="798161">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-798161" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i110150.net/i/5597632/798161/11305"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Increase-self-esteem-feel-great-about-who-you-are-after-mastering-a-foreign-language"><a href="#Increase-self-esteem-feel-great-about-who-you-are-after-mastering-a-foreign-language" class="headerlink" title="Increase self-esteem: feel great about who you are after mastering a foreign language"></a><strong>Increase self-esteem: feel great about who you are after mastering a foreign language</strong></h2><p><strong>8. Become a strong member of society</strong></p><p> If you subscribe to the worldview that every individual contributes something important to the whole, then you’ll realize how important learning a foreign language can be. As a multilingual, you’ll be the translator, the communicator and the one who bridges cultures. Every educated human being makes this world a better place. Wouldn’t it feel good to know that you’re playing a key role?</p><p><strong>9. Feel attractive and interesting</strong></p><p> Do you struggle to make small talk at events or parties? Have you often wished that you feel like a more interesting person? Knowing a foreign language is always an excellent conversation starter, and it can improve self-esteem. You might even meet someone who speaks the same foreign language and have something fun in common. As Spanish is one of the most popular languages in the world you might want to start by learning a few <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Spanish phrases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><strong>10. Experience a deeper connection</strong></p><p> Learning a foreign language naturally exposes you to aspects of other cultures that you might not have been familiar with before. Many of the barriers between cultures are based on meaningless fear, and by immersing yourself in other cultures, you will be helping to break through those barriers. Not only will you improve your life and better yourself as a person, but you’ll also be a positive influence on others.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Mondly-Learn-languages-free-online-Main-Screen1.png"                      alt="Mondly - Learn foreign languages free online" title="Top 10 Reasons Why You Should Learn A Foreign Language This Year 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948891/19272" target="_top" id="1948891">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948891" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948891/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/10-reasons-to-learn-a-foreign-language/&t=Top+10+Reasons+Why+You+Should+Learn+a+Foreign+Language+This+Year"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><p> Are you ready to improve your life and experience benefits you never expected?

These are known as Old Latin, Classical Latin, Vulgar Latin (that also influenced the Romance languages), Medieval Latin, Renaissance Latin, New Latin and Contemporary Latin or the Latin we use today in the Catholic Church, in science, mottos, et cetera (“and so forth”).</p><p> Additionally,<strong>Latin has also highly influenced English</strong> through ecclesiastical usage and writers who borrowed words that we still use today.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/latin-language-600x450.jpg"                      alt="latin language" title="This Is The Easiest Way To Learn Latin Online 3"                ></p><p> “Hercules furens” by Seneca.</p><p><em>Ergo</em> , history makes Latin the backbone of many present-day languages and studying it could help you gain valuable insight into the infrastructure of many other languages.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972698/19272" target="_top" id="1972698">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972698" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972698/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Latin-grammar-and-the-Latin-alphabet"><a href="#Latin-grammar-and-the-Latin-alphabet" class="headerlink" title="Latin grammar and the Latin alphabet"></a>Latin grammar and the Latin alphabet</h2><p> The Latin alphabet that many languages use today evolved from the visually similar Etruscan alphabet, which – in turn – evolved from the Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician alphabet that derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. As a result of Etruscans ruling early Rome, over time, their alphabet developed into the Latin alphabet that many centuries later became the writing system we all know today.</p><p>A fascinating origin story, isn’t it?</p><p> With three distinct genders, up to seven noun cases, five declensions, four verb conjugations, six tenses, three persons, three moods, two voices, two or three aspects and two numbers, Latin grammar may seem complicated. But once you start your Latin classes with Mondly and learn to read Latin, you’ll be surprised how fast you can actually master this language due to the knowledge you already possess.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130532/26400" target="_top" id="2130532">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130532" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130532/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Common-Latin-phrases-and-expressions-we-still-use-today"><a href="#Common-Latin-phrases-and-expressions-we-still-use-today" class="headerlink" title="Common Latin phrases and expressions we still use today"></a>Common Latin phrases and expressions we still use today</h2><p> <strong>Far from being a dead language, Latin is very much alive in our day-to-day conversations.</strong> <em>Carpe diem</em> ,<em>et cetera</em> ,<em>et alii</em> ,<em>habemus papam</em> ,<em>in vitro</em> ,<em>magna cum laude</em> ,<em>curriculum vitae</em> and_mea culpa_ are just a few of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Latin phrases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> we still use today.</p><p> Although Latin may be a “dead” language, it is not considered extinct because it is still in use in other ways.

Germany is an incredibly beautiful country and the<strong>German language</strong> is gradually beginning to be considered a lingua franca almost all over Europe.<a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875"><strong>Learning German</strong></a> is actually an excellent opportunity for self-development in today’s social and economic context.</p><p> And if that’s not enough, here are 10 more exciting reasons why you should learn German.</p><h2 id="1-You-will-make-friends-everywhere-in-the-world"><a href="#1-You-will-make-friends-everywhere-in-the-world" class="headerlink" title="1. You will make friends everywhere in the world"></a><strong>1. You will make friends everywhere in the world</strong></h2><p> With 20 days to almost six weeks of annual leave and a higher average income than most other countries, German people are the ultimate globetrotters. They are literally everywhere in the world!</p><p> This means that there’s a great possibility you’ll run into a<strong>German speaker</strong> during your business travels or during your vacation. Thus, if you want to be able to communicate and make friends everywhere you go,<strong>learn German.</strong></p><h2 id="2-You-will-be-able-to-enjoy-Dark"><a href="#2-You-will-be-able-to-enjoy-Dark" class="headerlink" title="2.

You will be able to enjoy Dark</h2><p> About how<strong>the German series Dark</strong> is going to make you love and learn the<strong>German language,</strong> I wrote a while ago. But now that the second season is available on Netflix, I’d say it’s an absolute must to go watch this masterpiece now. You don’t have to be a movie geek to like it. If you know how to appreciate good stories, amazing acting, and beautiful cinematography, Dark is definitely what you should binge-watch this weekend.</p><p> I remember having one of the best feelings in the world back in 2017 when I watched the first season and understood the first <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >German words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on my own. Just give it a try! I, for one, plan to watch season 3 without subtitles!</p><h2 id="3-German-is-the-most-spoken-native-language-in-Europe"><a href="#3-German-is-the-most-spoken-native-language-in-Europe" class="headerlink" title="3. German is the most spoken native language in Europe"></a>3. German is the most spoken native language in Europe</h2><p> The same as French – the language of love, German is a very notorious language worldwide and an official language of the European Union.</p><p> Our <strong><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >top 15 most spoken languages in the world <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,</strong> put German on 15th place with 100 million native speakers and around 56 million people that speak German as a second language. Add a few more millions of people that speak it as a third language and now you understand why German is slowly becoming a lingua franca.</p><p> And there’s more!<strong>The German language</strong> is the most widely spoken and official or co-official language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol (Italy), the German-speaking Community of <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Belgium <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and Liechtenstein, and it is also one of the three official languages of Luxembourg. In other words, in all these beautiful countries you’ll be able to travel without worrying you won’t be able to ask for help, directions or advice.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137973/21526" target="_top" id="2137973">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137973" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137973/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-The-economy-of-Germany-is-the-largest-national-economy-in-Europe"><a href="#4-The-economy-of-Germany-is-the-largest-national-economy-in-Europe" class="headerlink" title="4.

Apart from that, Germany remains the European Union’s most influential member nation – politically and economically speaking. Especially now, in the Brexit context.</p><p> That certainly makes Germany a top choice for countries to live in. Besides, as I already mentioned, in Germany, employees are rewarded in full measure for their hard work with a higher average income than in most other countries and up to six weeks of annual leave. Well, I would want to live in Deutschland! Wouldn’t you? And<strong>learning German</strong> would surely help you adjust there faster.</p><p> But even if you don’t want to move there, the fact that Germany is an economic powerhouse increases the possibility of you doing business with the German people. And learning the language greatly improves your professional relationship and the chances of a positive outcome.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049387/7443" target="_top" id="2049387">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049387" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049387/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Learning-German-will-boost-your-career-opportunities"><a href="#5-Learning-German-will-boost-your-career-opportunities" class="headerlink" title="5.

The words from our<strong>list of 100 most misspelled words in English</strong> pose challenges for more people than you think. No matter if you’re an English native speaker or not, hard-to-spell words are determined to give you a headache. And if bad spelling does happen, it’s usually in very important contexts like your application letter or during a conversation with your crush – can’t decide which one is more heartbreaking. 💔 So, you can probably agree that correct spelling in written communication is crucial regardless of the context.</p><p> Whether we’re talking about fancy words or downright common ones like “license” (not “lisence”), misspellings are like Thanos: inevitable. But even Thanos was finally defeated, so you, too, can vanquish misspelled words. The first step is to acknowledge them, so let’s do it. We’ll begin with a small but condensed list of the most misspelled words ever and continue with a complete list of the top 100 commonly misspelled words in English. Ready, steady, go!</p><h2 id="Top-10-Most-Commonly-Misspelled-Words-in-English"><a href="#Top-10-Most-Commonly-Misspelled-Words-in-English" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Most Commonly Misspelled Words in English"></a>Top 10 Most Commonly Misspelled Words in English</h2><h3 id="1-Awkward-not-akward"><a href="#1-Awkward-not-akward" class="headerlink" title="1.

The exact same rule applies to “believe”, so it’s advisable to use this mnemonic when in doubt.</p><p>Careful, though – there are some exceptions to it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959778/19272" target="_top" id="1959778">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959778" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959778/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Embarrassed-not-embarassed"><a href="#3-Embarrassed-not-embarassed" class="headerlink" title="3.

You’ll reduce the chances of finding yourself in an embarrassing bad spelling situation if you remember this one.</p><h3 id="4-Entrepreneur-not-enterpreneur"><a href="#4-Entrepreneur-not-enterpreneur" class="headerlink" title="4. Entrepreneur not enterpreneur"></a>4. Entrepreneur not enterpreneur</h3><p>Also commonly misspelled as: entrepeneur , entreprenur , entreperneur</p><p> We honestly can’t blame whoever misspells this one. It’s not only hard to spell but also <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >hard to pronounce <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The reason? It’s a French word coming from the root entreprendre (‘undertake’).</p><h3 id="5-Liaison-not-liasion"><a href="#5-Liaison-not-liasion" class="headerlink" title="5. Liaison not liasion"></a>5. Liaison not liasion</h3><p> There’s a reason why you’re never sure how to spell “liaison”, “bureaucracy”, “manoeuvre”, “questionnaire”, and “connoisseur”. They do not follow the same patterns because they are all <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >French words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p>Your best bet is to just remember the correct spelling.</p><h3 id="6-License-not-lisence"><a href="#6-License-not-lisence" class="headerlink" title="6. License not lisence"></a>6. License not lisence</h3><p> This is a special situation. In American English, it’s always spelled “license” – no matter what. On the other hand, in British English, it’s spelled “license” when it’s a verb and “licence” when it’s a noun.</p><p> Basically, the only wrong spelling is “lisense”. However, once you decide which spelling you’re going to use – American or British – it’s best to go forward with that one don’t combine both.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2127886">                    <video width="576" height="1024" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2127886.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2127886">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2127886.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2127886%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2127886/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Receive-not-recieve"><a href="#7-Receive-not-recieve" class="headerlink" title="7.

We all know that moment when you stare at a word for ages and still can’t believe it has two sets of double letters. But it’s true. There are many such examples. In fact, “misspelled” is one of them and people often misspell it.</p><p>Loading poll …</p><p>Coming Soon</p><p> What is the hardest word to spell for you?</p><p> Awkward  Awkward52 (17.16 %)</p><p> Embarrassed  Embarrassed152 (50.17 %)</p><p> License  License73 (24.09 %)</p><p> Successful  Successful26 (8.58 %)</p><p> Anyway, it’s easy to make excuses! We’ve all been there. But the truth is that spelling matters. Not only in professional settings but everywhere in life. Sometimes, your spelling is the first impression someone gets of you. What would your future employer think if you wrote “aquire” instead of “acquire” or “bizzare” instead of “bizarre” (easy with the Zs, Buzz)? Good spelling can be the difference between losing or getting that dream job.</p><p> But why is that? Why do people place such a high importance on spelling? Well, good spelling can tell a couple of things about you:</p><ul><li><strong>You pay attention to details:</strong> Employers often consider this a great asset to have in today’s world. If, unlike other candidates, you spelled Mrs. Saoirse’s name right in your letter of application, you may get an extra point for attention to detail!</li><li><strong>You’re a perfectionist:</strong> Contrary to what some people may think, being a perfectionist is not always a bad thing. If you’re a perfectionist, you won’t permit bad spelling to make you seem sloppy.</li><li><strong>You respect your readers:</strong> Regardless of how many people will read your work, good spelling shows that you value the time they take to do it.</li><li><strong>You have a strong educational background:</strong> Proficiency in spelling often indicates a good grasp of the language. It suggests that you had the opportunity to learn and practice language skills extensively.</li></ul><h2 id="Commonly-Misspelled-Words-Table-Top-100"><a href="#Commonly-Misspelled-Words-Table-Top-100"

Improving Your Spelling</h2><p> How do you avoid misspellings? One obvious answer would be spell-checkers. Alas, spell-checkers won’t actually help you to improve your spelling. You will continue to misspell words and they’ll continue to correct them like the good friends they are. This process won’t stimulate you to learn the correct spelling because somebody else already does the job for you. However, if you do want a very good spell-checker to keep you in check, we recommend Grammarly.</p><p> Supposing you really want to improve your English spelling, you’ll just have to practice. Go through this list, then add your own commonly misspelled words and practice writing them a few times. You’ll get the hang of it with just a few attempts.</p><p> If you’re only starting to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn English <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (or any other language), put your best foot forward with a language learning app such as <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-7340&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-7340&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-7340" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Not only does the app include spelling exercises, but it also gives you access to quick lesson reviews with all the words you’ve learned. The best way to avoid bad spelling is to convince your brain to remember the correct spelling from day one!</p><p>Let’s recap. To improve your spelling, you can:</p><ul><li><strong>Practice proofreading:</strong> In other words, carefully check for errors in your text before sharing or publishing it.</li><li><strong>Use spell-checkers:</strong> Grammarly is the best at keeping your written communication tidy, but we can also rely on Word’s built-in spell-checker or even ask ChatGPT or Google when you’re not sure whether your word is spelled right or not.</li><li><strong>Memorize challenging words:</strong> We all have some words we keep getting wrong. So, our recommendation would be to take a pen and a piece of paper and write them by hand a few times until they stick. It’s traditional but it works.</li></ul><h2 id="Why-Some-Words-Are-Tricky"><a href="#Why-Some-Words-Are-Tricky" class="headerlink" title="Why Some Words Are Tricky"></a>Why Some Words Are Tricky</h2><p> When it comes to spelling, the English language is a real maverick. No wonder there are spelling bee competitions organized for young English-speaking students.</p><p>English words can be tricky to spell for several reasons:</p><ol><li><strong>Silent letters:</strong> These are not pronounced, but they are included in the spelling, which makes the job even harder. Thank you, English!</li><li><strong>Double consonants:</strong> There are so many of them in English, that it’s tempting to use them even when you’re not supposed to.</li><li><strong>Homophones:</strong> Words that sound the same but are spelled differently? A nightmare for spelling. Is it “their,” “there,” or “they’re”? It can be hard to tell.</li><li><strong>Exceptions to rules:</strong> Remember “I before E, except after C”? Well, that’s not true for “weird”, “height” and many others.</li><li><strong>Phonetic inconsistencies:</strong> To top it all off, the same sound can be spelled in different ways in different words (like the “oo” sound in “boot” and “blood”), and the same spelling can represent different sounds (like the “ough” in “through,” “though,” “tough,” and “thought”).</li></ol><p> Still, no matter how tricky, we love the English language because it brings everyone together. At this point in time, it wouldn’t be wrong to call it the_lingua franca_ of the world. A_lingua franca_ is a language used for communication between people who do not share a native language.

Since we worked hard to create Mondly AR for about 9 months, our opinion would probably have been subjective. So we wanted to see how normal people react to Mondly AR when testing it for the first time. The result surprised us. Here’s how Clara, one of the students, reviewed the experience:</p><hr><p> <em>If you tried one of the<strong>Mondly language learning apps</strong> (available for both <a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-1295&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-1295&utm_source=blog-post-id-1295&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-1295&utm_source=blog-post-id-1295&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-1295&utm_source=blog-post-id-1295&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-1295&mt=8" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-1295&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-1295&utm_source=blog-post-id-1295&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-1295&utm_source=blog-post-id-1295&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-1295&utm_source=blog-post-id-1295&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-1295&mt=8" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> users), then you know that they already are a strong competitor for Duolingo and managed to literally catch our eyes with their <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >VR conversational chatbot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

That is what we all call learning through play. Now, I may be wrong, but it seems to me that this is also the concept that Mondly tries to cultivate with their new AR app.</em></p><p> <em>A few days ago I had the chance to try their new <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondlyar.languages&hl=en"><strong>augmented reality app</strong></a> and you will see why this made me believe that Mondly counts on the mix between innovation and the concept of learning through play; and why they might not be wrong in doing so.</em></p><p>_ <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ckAvyr8RNxvc0Tbued/giphy.gif"                      alt="AUGMENTED REALITY LION" title="The New Augmented Reality App From Mondly Is The Future Of Language Learning 2"                > _</p><h2 id="An-out-of-this-world-encounter"><a href="#An-out-of-this-world-encounter" class="headerlink" title="An out of this world encounter"></a><em>An out of this world encounter</em></h2><p> <em>The<strong>new augmented reality experience from Mondly</strong> introduces us to a new character named Mondly with whom you can talk in various contexts (she can even change her outfit and become a waitress at the restaurant) and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn a new language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the meantime. After all, we all know it is easier to learn a new language when you are being social. The rendez-vous  between me and my new virtual friend started after we scanned the room we were in using just the iPad’s camera. She immediately and seamlessly appeared in front of me.

You just have to ask her to show you an animal. “Show me a rabbit” – I said – and a virtual rabbit magically appeared on the floor. I got to tell you: I have never been so amazed when seeing a rabbit in my whole life. Besides that, I learned that “rabbit” is “conejo” in Spanish. The rabbit started jumping around and I suddenly felt that anything could happen at this point so I quickly asked her to show me another animal fearing that the rabbit could take me to Wonderland.</em></p><p> <em>The cow, the chicken and the flying eagle followed and I was simply mesmerized. I truly felt like a kid all over again. I walked around the room and discovered that I was capable to see Mondly and the animals from different angles and distances. I’m almost 24, but I’m quite sure that my 70 years old grandmother would also enjoy this as much as I did.

The answers lie in the learning process itself.</p><p>New language users typically pursue competency in the first 3-5 years it takes to learn a language. Then, we coast. We learn just enough English needed to achieve our goals.</p><p>Advanced learners don’t just pursue competency; they pursue <em>connection.</em></p><p>Nelson Mandela said:</p><blockquote><p>“If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.”</p></blockquote><p>Language learning, after all, is about more than just talking your mouth off. It’s about deep and authentic human connection, about relationships and making them stronger. Connection trumps competency. Connection is the ultimate sign of language excellence.</p><p>So how do we excel at connection? By becoming a lifelong learner of a language, no matter how good you already are at speaking it.</p><p>Anyone can become a lifelong learner, whether you’re in school or not, as long as you take learning seriously. Here are 5 powerful habits that all lifelong language learners should possess.</p><h2 id="1-Study-Body-Language"><a href="#1-Study-Body-Language" class="headerlink" title="1. Study Body Language"></a>1. Study Body Language</h2><blockquote><p>“Research indicates the pitch, volume, and pace of your voice affect what people think you said about FIVE TIMES as much as the actual words you used.” – Deborah Gruenfeld</p></blockquote><p>Body language focuses on visual cues used to express more information and emotion. Body language, however, also reveals what spoken language doesn’t: how you really feel.</p><p>Basic and intermediate language learners focus on the literal and exact words in conversation.</p><p>In personal or professional interactions, advanced students focus on the literal communication AND the visual. They learn to read the body language of others, and work to improve their own.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/DaNwD0SPavhF6/giphy.gif?cid=3640f6095c08f4ca7130495a6fa7153a"                      alt="giphy" title="How To Take Your English To The Next Level 2"                ></p><blockquote><p>“A conversation is so much more than words, a conversation is eyes, smiles, the silences between the words.” – Annika Thor</p></blockquote><h2 id="2-Learn-to-Enjoy-Wordplay"><a href="#2-Learn-to-Enjoy-Wordplay" class="headerlink" title="2. Learn to Enjoy Wordplay"></a>2. Learn to Enjoy Wordplay</h2><p>How completely, and how rapidly, do you get jokes, spot puns, and catch lyrical or cultural references? How well do you understand wordplay while reading, conversing, or listening to music?</p><p>For advanced English learners, even the subtlest wordplay clicks within seconds, sometimes tenths of a second. Music, movies, and comedy are full of pop culture references, famous quotes, sarcasm, and all kinds of literary devices planted to delight the few members in the audience who are paying close attention.</p><p>Beginner and intermediate level users have a tougher time grasping all the puns or even enjoying figurative language. The advanced language learner loves playing with words and numbers, and as a result, they think quicker on their own feet in many aspects.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Get-Outside-Your-Comfort-Zone"><a href="#3-Get-Outside-Your-Comfort-Zone" class="headerlink" title="3. Get Outside Your Comfort Zone"></a>3. Get Outside Your Comfort Zone</h2><blockquote><p>“One good conversation can shift the direction of change forever.” – Linda Lam</p></blockquote><p>Most English speakers are capable of having full-blown conversations in private or in group settings within their inner circle, AKA the Comfort Zone. But what about speaking in front of a class or an office audience? What about impromptu conversations or polarizing debates with friends?</p><p>How well can you speak up and express yourself when stuck in a high-pressure situation?</p><p>Humans’ language skills tend to be weaker in these fight-or-flight situations, regardless of how articulate we are normally, so the question has to be asked: what are we doing to get better?</p><p>A true language expert has to practice a lot in order to learn to clearly express facts, opinions, and stories. It also takes a lot of practice to have the presence of mind to know when to be quiet, listen, and fully understand the other person.</p><p>Expanding your language comfort zone takes a lot of time and pain, and unless you’re naturally born this way, you can’t afford not to become natural at it.</p><p>Steal lessons on stretching your comfort zone from these masters of language:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theodysseyonline.com/public-speaking-lessons">Public speaking lessons revealed in Hasan Minhaj’s <em>The Homecoming King</em></a></li><li>_ <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Yes-Improvisation-Reverses-Creativity-Collaboration-Lessons/dp/0062248545" >Yes, And: How Improvisation Reverses “No, But” Thinking and Improves Creativity and Collaboration–Lessons from The Second City <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Excellence-Dividend-Meeting-Tech-Tide-ebook/dp/B074DHM8LH/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1533936817&sr=1-1&keywords=excellence+dividend" >The Excellence Dividend: Meeting the Tech Tide with Work That Wows and Jobs That Last <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148639/16836" target="_top" id="2148639">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148639" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148639/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Embrace-Old-English"><a href="#4-Embrace-Old-English" class="headerlink" title="4.

It’s boring. It’s impossible to make sense of. It’s not how anyone talks any more, so it feels irrelevant. We can’t justify the time and frustration.</p><p>But where ordinary English users stop is where advanced learners get started. What we see as pointless, they see as opportunity – an opportunity to understand how our ancestors expressed thoughts and emotions, and viewed the world. An opportunity to understand the roots of language in human history. An opportunity to deeply appreciate older forms of art.</p><p>They identify the obstacles that make reading Old English so challenging, and come up with solutions, in order to get better. They stay calm and keep on reading until patterns start forming, one painful sentence after another, until literal and symbolic meanings become clear.</p><p>Want to take your language skills to the next level? Become a student of Old English and start reading Beowulf, and keep on reading until it starts to make sense.</p><h2 id="5-Learn-Basic-Sign-Language"><a href="#5-Learn-Basic-Sign-Language" class="headerlink" title="5.

Easy, not knowing a single sign language sign.</p><p>Not having deaf colleagues, friends, or family has always been my excuse to not learn sign language. What do I need it for? Who am I going to use it with?

Lifelong learners, however, realize that all forms of primary language – visual, verbal, and written – have equal importance and benefits.</p><p>Throughout history and even today, communication and connection have been lopsided between hearing people and deaf people. Deaf people have to learn to read and write in English. They have to learn to read lips, on top of learning sign language. The more hearing people learn <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HoC9_ir3s&feature=youtu.be" >basic sign language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the better we’ll all be able to understand one another.</p><p>Lifelong learners of language don’t just stop at 5 years. They work on getting better at it nearly their whole life.
