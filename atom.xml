For some Services, a user may register using an alias name (pseudonym) that is not otherwise associated with personal data provided to Mondly.<strong><em>Note:</em></strong> some of the apps might also include a leadership board noting username, profile pictures and points so an alias name should be provided if you are not comfortable with this being made public to other users.</li><li>We also process any other voluntary details that you can save in your profile, and your communication preferences (including if you raise a complaint and&#x2F;or support query).</li><li>We will process your login details: including username and password and similar credentials.</li><li>You may elect to record your voice practising the language (but this is optional). Further, you may elect to use our virtual reality app to practice languages in realistic dialogues inspired by events (e.g. check-in to a hotel in Paris).

Scope</strong></p><p> 1.1. The following terms and conditions (“<strong>Terms of Use</strong> “) apply between<strong>ATI STUDIOS A.P.P.S. S.R.L</strong> , with its registered office at 50A Griviței Avenue Building 15, Entrance C, 1st Floor, Apt. 1 Brașov County, Brasov, Romania (“<strong>Mondly</strong> “) and you as a user of the Mondly App with its free basic functions as well as additional paid functions selected by you by way of so-called InApp Purchases (“<strong>Order(s)”)</strong> (collectively<strong>“App”</strong>).</p><p> 1.2. The App can only be used by consumers, i.e. persons who are not acting for predominantly commercial or self-employed purposes (“<strong>users</strong> “,<strong>“you”</strong>).</p><p> 1.3. References in these Terms of Use to the applicability of statutory provisions are for clarification purposes only. As such, the statutory provisions will still apply even if not set out in these Terms of Use, unless these are supplemented or expressly excluded.</p><p><strong>2. Subject matter of performance and conclusion of contract</strong></p><p> 2.1. The Mondly App provides a language learning solution according to the available features that allow users to learn many different languages. Mondly App shall act as a tool to support users to improve language skills but does not promise that the user will reach a specific progress in learning a language.</p><p> 2.2. The user can access the App via the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store and download it to his or her device in accordance with these terms of use here, which are displayed in each case as part of the contract initiation process and must be accepted by the user before starting the download process. By clicking on the download button, the user makes an offer to conclude a contract for the use of the App, including its free basic functions, which Mondly accepts by making the App available for use on the user’s device.</p><p> 2.3. If the user wishes to expand the basic functions of the App with additional functions for which a fee is charged (“premium features”), the user must place an order in the App. Offers by Mondly for paid content are not binding. Orders placed by the user constitute a binding offer to conclude a contract for the respective premium features. By clicking on the button “Order with obligation to pay”, the user makes a binding offer to conclude a contract for the respective premium features. The user’s offer only becomes binding for both parties when Mondly actually provides the premium feature in the App.</p><p> 2.4. The user can use the App and all of its functions, regardless of whether they are paid or free of charge, without having to create a user account in the App. A user account only needs to be created if the user wishes to save their learning progress in the App.</p><p> 2.5. For a limited period of time specified in the app, Mondly may, at its own discretion, make individual additional premium features available to the user free of charge for test purposes.</p><p> 2.6. We will send you the contract, which contains the details of your order, as well as these Terms of Use in text form. For security reasons, the contract text is no longer accessible online after the contract has been concluded. Furthermore, you can access these terms of use in the App in the settings under “Info”.</p><p><strong>3. Prices and terms of payment</strong></p><p> 3.1. The user can use the App with the basic functions specified in the service description free of charge.</p><p> 3.2. For the use of the premium features of the App that go beyond the basic functions of the App, the user must pay the fees shown during the order process.</p><p> 3.3. Depending on the operating system of the user’s device, payment is made via the Apple App Store or Google Play Store account using the means of payment available there. The terms and conditions of the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store will apply in relation to this payment.</p><p> 3.4. An internet connection is required to download the app, which must be provided at the user’s own expense.</p><p><strong>4. Rights of use</strong></p><ul><li>During the term of the respective contract, Mondly grants the user the non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to use the App, including its free basic functions and any premium features, on a single mobile end device, limited to the term of the contract, exclusively for private purposes in accordance with these Terms of Use, i.e. to install it on the respective device, to copy it to the extent technically necessary for use in accordance with the contract, to load it, to display it and to run it.</li><li>Neither the App nor its respective free basic and premium features may be shared with or made available to third parties without Mondly’s prior written consent. In particular, the user may not grant third parties access to the App and its service components, and in particular may not disclose its access data to third parties. If the user creates a user account, the user must protect his user password from access by third parties and keep it secret. The user may not pass on his password to unauthorised third parties.</li></ul><p> 4.3. In particular, the user is prohibited from (i) sublicensing, selling, reselling, transferring, assigning, distributing, sharing, leasing, renting or otherwise generating revenue from the Mondly Services, (ii) reverse engineering, disassembling, deciphering, translating, decompiling or creating derivative versions of the Mondly Software, except as required by law, (iii) enter or generate any data or other content in the App that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, invasive of another’s privacy or publicity rights, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable.</p><p> 4.4. For the term of the respective contract, the user grants Mondly the non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable right to use content entered by the user in the App, in particular to reproduce, store and process it in the App on the user’s mobile device to the extent that this is necessary for the use of the App, including its respective free basic and premium features, for the benefit of the user in accordance with these Terms of Use and the Description of Services.</p><p><strong>5. Term and termination</strong></p><p> 5.1. The use of the App, including its free basic functions, is not subject to a fixed term. Mondly or the user are entitled to terminate the App at any time with immediate effect. Mondly can terminate by deactivating a corresponding free basic function in the App or the App as a whole. The user may terminate the App including its free components by uninstalling the App from their mobile device. Mondly’s must not terminate the App including its free basic functions to the extent that the user has subscribed to premium features which require the use of the free App and&#x2F;or its free basic features as a precondition.</p><p> 5.2. For premium features, depending on the respective additional function, an initial term of 30 calendar days or 12 months applies from the day of activation of the premium feature in the app. The term of the premium feature is indicated in the App its respective description in the app and can be viewed transparently in the app on an ongoing basis. After expiry of the initial term, this is automatically extended for another same period, whereby the user is entitled to terminate the contractual relationship extended in this way at any time with a notice period of one month. Users can terminate by deselecting the respective premium feature in the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store.</p><p> 5.3. The right of either party to terminate the respective contract for good cause shall remain unaffected. Good cause shall be deemed to exist if the terminating party, taking into account the respective circumstances of the individual case and weighing the interests of both parties, can no longer reasonably be expected to continue the contractual relationship until the agreed termination or until the expiry of a notice period. If the good cause consists in the breach of an obligation under the contract, termination is only permissible after the unsuccessful expiry of a period set for remedy or after an unsuccessful warning. Section 323 (2) numbers 1 and 2 German Civil Code shall apply mutatis mutandis to the dispensability of setting a time limit for remedial action and to the dispensability of a warning. The determination of a time limit for remedial action and a warning are also dispensable if there are special circumstances which justify immediate termination after weighing the interests of both parties.</p><p> 5.4. In the event of termination, for whatever reason, all rights of use granted to the user in respect of the terminated contractual service shall come to an end. I.e. in the event of termination of a particular premium feature, the user’s rights of use to this terminated premium feature will come to an end, but the user’s rights to use other premium features or the App and its free basic functions will continue (unless these have also been terminated). If the user terminates due to a breach of a contractual obligation by Mondly and&#x2F;or for good cause and if the Customer has paid usage fees in advance, Mondly will refund the Customer the usage fees paid in advance on a proportionate basis for the period from the date on which the termination takes effect.</p><p><strong>6. Warranty</strong></p><p> 6.1. If the App, including its free basic functions and any premium features selected by the user, contains a defect at the time of provision which renders the App, a free basic function and&#x2F;or a premium feature unsuitable for use in accordance with the contract, or if such a defect arises during the term of the contract, the user will not be charged for the period during which the App was not suitable.</p><p> 6.2. In cases in which the suitability of the app, a free basic function and&#x2F;or a premium feature for use in accordance with the contract is not unavailable but merely reduced, the user shall only pay a reduced usage fee. An non-material defect or interruption shall not give rise to a reduced fee.</p><p> 6.3. Claims for damages by the user shall be subject to the limitations of liability set out in the following clause 7.</p><p><strong>7. Liability</strong></p><p> 7.1. In the event of culpable injury to life, limb or health, the existence of a guarantee, fraudulent intent or in cases of liability under the Product Liability Act, Mondly shall be liable in accordance with the statutory provisions.</p><p> 7.2.

Some will say it’s super hard, some will say it’s easy. But there’s no point in sugarcoating it. Learning Polish – much like any other language – is about being consistent. There’s no brain implant that will make you fluent in Polish overnight (yet) the same way there’s no pill that will get anyone fit that fast. You have to work for it. Luckily, this smart strategy will make everything easier and help you study Polish faster than you’d imagine.</p><p> <strong>The secret is to follow a logical set of steps that will help your brain ease into the language and learn it naturally.</strong> Read on to discover how to study Polish fast by yourself using a strategy consisting of 11 easy steps.</p><h2 id="Is-Polish-hard-to-study"><a href="#Is-Polish-hard-to-study" class="headerlink" title="Is Polish hard to study?"></a>Is Polish hard to study?</h2><p> If you just decided to add Polish under your belt, you deserve congratulations. This means you didn’t let yourself become intimidated by the rumors regarding Polish being one of the hardest languages to learn.</p><p> According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/" >the FSI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Foreign Service Institute) of the US government, a native English speaker would need about<strong>1100 class hours or 44 weeks of practice to become fluent in Polish.</strong></p><p> Thus, Polish is not actually one of the hardest languages to learn because it does not compete directly with Japanese, Chinese or Korean. It’s true it is not one of the easiest either, but this shouldn’t discourage you. After all, you’re about to discover the most efficient strategy on how to study Polish fast.</p><p> Ultimately, it all depends on how motivated you are. If you are really passionate and dedicated to <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-6779&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6779?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=pl&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6779?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=pl" >learning Polish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the entire process will be effortless.</p><p>Good luck!</p><h3 id="1-Get-used-to-the-sound-of-the-Polish-language"><a href="#1-Get-used-to-the-sound-of-the-Polish-language" class="headerlink" title="1. Get used to the sound of the Polish language"></a>1. Get used to the sound of the Polish language</h3><p> First things first. Before starting to study Polish, you have to let your brain get used to the sound of the Polish language. Listen to podcasts in Polish, watch videos in Polish or listen to Polish music – whatever you want.</p><p> While it may seem against reason to listen to audios in Polish before actually knowing basic Polish, it will help your brain ease into the language. Did it ever happen to you to travel to a foreign country, hear its foreign language for days on end, then come back home and hear the same language although people were speaking your <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >mother language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ? That was your brain that had gotten used to certain sounds and now tried to identify them again.</p><p> To apply the first step of this Polish learning strategy, you’ll have to try to replicate that situation and get your brain ready for the next step.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982456">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982456.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982456">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982456.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982456%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982456/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Learn-the-Polish-alphabet"><a href="#2-Learn-the-Polish-alphabet" class="headerlink" title="2. Learn the Polish alphabet"></a>2. Learn the Polish alphabet</h3><p> Contrary to popular belief, it’s great to learn the Polish alphabet before actually diving into the language. How would you read Polish texts if you don’t recognize the letters?</p><p> The Polish alphabet is based on the Latin alphabet and it has 32 letters: 9 vowels and 23 consonants. In addition to the letters you already know, you’ll also find nine Polish letters with diacritics:</p><ul><li>the tail known as <em>ogonek</em> (ą, ę);</li><li>the acute accent or <em>kreska</em>  (ć, ń, ó, ś, ź);</li><li>the overdot or <em>kropka</em> (ż);</li><li>the stroke (ł).</li></ul><p>Not very difficult, is it?</p><h3 id="3-Master-the-Polish-pronunciation-rules"><a href="#3-Master-the-Polish-pronunciation-rules" class="headerlink" title="3. Master the Polish pronunciation rules"></a>3. Master the Polish pronunciation rules</h3><p> When it comes to pronunciation rules, the good news is that Polish is a phonetic language. This means that Polish is pronounced the same way it’s written. Besides, it has no silent letters.</p><p> However, this doesn’t mean Polish doesn’t have its tricky pronunciation rules. You’ll have to pay extra attention to its consonant clusters, digraphs and trigraphs.</p><p> Once you have mastered the Polish alphabet and its pronunciation rules, you’ll know how to read every new word in Polish. This means you can safely move on to the most exciting step so far!</p><h3 id="4-Learn-the-most-common-Polish-words"><a href="#4-Learn-the-most-common-Polish-words" class="headerlink" title="4. Learn the most common Polish words"></a>4. Learn the most common Polish words</h3><p> Expanding your Polish vocabulary is – without a doubt – the most straightforward path to Polish fluency. The more words you know, the closer you are to being conversational. Nevertheless, not all words carry equal weight. Studies have shown that knowing the 100 most common Polish words will help you understand 50% of any text in Polish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/polish-words-960x761.png"                      alt="polish words" title="How To Study Polish Fast: A Smart Strategy For Beginners 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139117/17108" target="_top" id="2139117">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139117" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139117/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If you want to work smarter, not harder, you should focus on these high-frequency, high-value words first. Imagine learning as little as two new Polish words per day. In 50 days, you’ll understand half of any communication in Polish. Isn’t this amazing?</p><h3 id="5-Continue-with-Polish-phrases"><a href="#5-Continue-with-Polish-phrases" class="headerlink" title="5. Continue with Polish phrases"></a>5. Continue with Polish phrases</h3><p>The next logical step is to put some context around those words.</p><p> It’s best to not get stuck with words for too long. Once you have mastered the most common ones,<strong>learning whole Polish phrases will help you get fluent faster.</strong> Your brain will make the connections and fill in the gaps as you go.</p><p> It’s easier to speak Polish if you’re already familiar with the context of a word. If you focus too much on single words, you’ll be inclined to construct the phrases in your native language and only then translate them into Polish. And that’s not your goal. Your goal is to shorten the process and think directly in Polish.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027176/19272" target="_top" id="2027176">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027176" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027176/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Speak-Polish-from-day-1"><a href="#6-Speak-Polish-from-day-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Speak Polish from day 1"></a>6. Speak Polish from day 1</h3><p> Everybody knows that learning by doing is the most effective learning method. And speaking Polish makes no exception.</p><p> If you speak Polish from day 1, you’ll allow your speech muscles to get used to the pronunciation as your progress through your learning journey. This way, you won’t begin training your speech muscles at the end when you should already be speaking Polish.</p><p> In addition, speaking the language from the beginning will help you get rid of the anxiety. We are all nervous when we need to speak a foreign language in front of other people. But practicing speaking regularly can help you gain confidence in time.</p><h3 id="7-Dive-into-Polish-grammar"><a href="#7-Dive-into-Polish-grammar" class="headerlink" title="7. Dive into Polish grammar"></a>7. Dive into Polish grammar</h3><p> Most people don’t enjoy this step in the learning strategy. Unfortunately, it can’t be dodged. It’s in your best interest to dive into the Polish grammar and make sure you’re delivering the message correctly.</p><p> Did you know that good grammar can open doors? According to some studies, recruiters tend not to like applications that have poor spelling and grammar. In addition, people on dating apps are less likely to continue talking to someone who uses poor grammar.</p><p> If you are still having doubts about this step, don’t forget that studying Polish grammar will structure the knowledge you have already gained. In turn, this will help you make further connections on your own.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/learn-polish-1-960x644.jpg"                      alt="&#39;Learn Polish&#39; by Bianca Fazacas©" title="How To Study Polish Fast: A Smart Strategy For Beginners 5"                ></p><h3 id="8-Experience-immersion"><a href="#8-Experience-immersion" class="headerlink" title="8.

Imagine what it would be like to forget most of everything you’ve learned because one day you just stopped practicing Polish.</p><p> The best way to study Polish is to study the language in short bursts every day. Avoid tiring yourself learning for hours one day and then not learning at all the next few. Instead, practice for as little as 10 to 15 minutes daily and allow your brain to cement the knowledge bit by bit. This way, you’ll ensure maximum retention with the least amount of effort.</p><p> Your motto for this step: “Practice Polish a little bit every day and speak like a native forever!”.</p><h3 id="10-Practice-reading-and-writing-in-Polish"><a href="#10-Practice-reading-and-writing-in-Polish" class="headerlink" title="10. Practice reading and writing in Polish"></a>10. Practice reading and writing in Polish</h3><p> You’re finally here: understanding and speaking Polish effortlessly. What’s next?</p><p> Unfortunately, not practicing Polish for a while can lead to forgetting. We’ve all been there with the foreign languages we studied in high school but never used again.</p><p> Therefore, if you want some extra practice to keep the Polish language fresh in your mind, you can read or write in Polish. It will help you to both expand and keep your knowledge.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/how-to-learn-polish/&t=How+to+Study+Polish+Fast:+A+Smart+Strategy+for+Beginners"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1167086/14483" target="_top" id="1167086">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1167086" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://electronicx.pxf.io/i/5597632/1167086/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="11-Download-the-best-app-to-study-Polish"><a href="#11-Download-the-best-app-to-study-Polish" class="headerlink" title="11.

Or, at least, this is <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >the learning method behind Mondly! <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  By immersion, we mean surrounding yourself and actually using the language you want to learn on a day-to-day basis. Think of the language that you speak, write, or think in every day, apart from your native one. Yup, if you’re reading this article, no matter your nationality, chances are you are already immersed in the English language. Need a few tips on how to carry on this trend (that by the way, you’ve been using unconsciously with English) to other language learning experiences? We took a page out of <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Johannes Honterus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ’ book, and you can do that too!</p><p>But of course, let’s start with the <em>whys</em> before the <em>hows</em>  . Why should you immerse yourself in a language that you want to learn? It’s pretty simple actually: the more you speak, read, and write in that language, the faster you can learn it. And now, let’s give you some tips!</p><h2 id="Travel"><a href="#Travel" class="headerlink" title="Travel"></a>Travel</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/man-on-the-mountain-960x720.jpg"                      alt="man on the mountain" title="How To Immerse Yourself In A Language: 6 Helpful Tips 2"                ></p><p> ‘Traveler’ by Simon English©</p><p> Yes, this one is a no-brainer, but it’s also the best method that you may use to learn a foreign language. First, choose the language. No inspiration?

Once you choose a language, choose a destination. When you’re there, do as the locals do. Make friends, communicate with everyone, and soak up the culture and habits. If you want more than a friendship, strike up a romance by using one of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >40 best pick-up lines from around the world <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> This should provide a great starting point.

If offline you can’t find them, the World Wide Web will be your friend. Find people to converse with online, in forums and activity groups, for example, and you’ll share an interest with the fluent speakers of the language you want to learn. That should get the ball rolling. Of course, don’t be afraid of making mistakes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087234/19272" target="_top" id="2087234">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087234" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087234/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Order-using-the-language-you’re-learning"><a href="#Order-using-the-language-you’re-learning" class="headerlink" title="Order using the language you’re learning"></a>Order using the language you’re learning</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plate-of-food-960x641.jpg"                      alt="plate of food" title="How To Immerse Yourself In A Language: 6 Helpful Tips 3"                ></p><p> ‘Tasty’ by Los Muertos Crew©</p><p> Ok, so there’s this little Mexican food place near where I study and I love their tacos.

If you are interested in anything Dutch, you’ve come to the right place.</p><p> It’s true that Dutch and_Deutsch_ look and sound somehow similar and there *was* a connection there. But not anymore. So let’s settle this out once and for all.</p><h2 id="Where-are-Dutch-people-from"><a href="#Where-are-Dutch-people-from" class="headerlink" title="Where are Dutch people from?"></a>Where are Dutch people from?</h2><p> It’s pretty obvious why this confusion still exists. There’s no surprise that even the reverse of this question (“what are people from the Netherlands called?”) is also a very popular Google inquiry. So what is the answer after all?</p><p> First, you should know that a demonym is a name used for the people who live in a particular country or state. Naturally, French people are from France,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Polish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> people are from Poland, and Italian people are from Italy. So where are Dutch people from?</p><p><strong>The Dutch people are from the Netherlands.</strong> As unrelated as that may seem, there is a whole history to it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148633/16836" target="_top" id="2148633">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148633" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148633/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Why-are-Dutch-people-called-Dutch"><a href="#Why-are-Dutch-people-called-Dutch" class="headerlink" title="Why are Dutch people called Dutch?"></a>Why are Dutch people called Dutch?</h3><p> It seems that the confusion stems from the English-speaking people and the reason can be found by studying <strong>the <a class="link"   href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/dutch" >etymology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of the word ‘dutch’</strong> . I won’t bore you with all the details, but the bottom line is that in the late 14th century the word referred to ‘a German language’ or to ‘German, non-Scandinavian continental Germanic’. Additionally, the word corresponds to the Old English adjective_þeodisc_ (‘belonging to the people’) which was used to refer to the common language of Germanic people (as opposed to Latin).</p><p> As a consequence, over time, <strong>English-speaking people used the word ‘Dutch’ to refer to both people from Netherlands and Germany.</strong> ‘High Dutch’ referred to people living in the mountainous region (now southern Germany). ‘Low Dutch’ referred to people from the flatlands (now the Netherlands).</p><p> And this is not everything. Within the Holy Roman Empire, the word ‘Netherlands’ was widely used to indicate people from the low-lying (‘nether’) region (‘land’). That’s how ‘the Kingdom of the Netherlands’ got its name when it became a formal, separate country in 1815.</p><h3 id="Where-is-the-Netherlands"><a href="#Where-is-the-Netherlands" class="headerlink" title="Where is the Netherlands?"></a>Where is the Netherlands?</h3><p> The Netherlands and the Kingdom of the Netherlands are two different entities. While the Netherlands is a country located in Western Europe, the Kingdom of the Netherlands is a comprehensive sovereign state consisting of four constituent countries: the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten.</p><p> So where exactly in Western Europe is the Netherlands? The country borders Germany to the east,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Belgium <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest. Its largest city and capital is Amsterdam.</p><h3 id="The-Netherlands-vs-Holland"><a href="#The-Netherlands-vs-Holland" class="headerlink" title="The Netherlands vs Holland"></a>The Netherlands vs Holland</h3><p>Okay, bare with me. There’s more.</p><p> <strong>Many people mistake the Netherland for Holland, but Holland is in fact a region of the Netherlands.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/netherlands-vs-holland.png"                      alt="netherlands vs holland" title="Where Are Dutch People From?

Originally referring to the people from the northern region of the Netherlands, ‘Holland’ literally meant ‘wood-land’. But over time, English speakers began to mistakenly associate it with the entire country.</p><p> Formerly the County of Holland (the most important county in the Low Countries region), Holland now consists of North and South Holland. These are two of the nation’s twelve provinces.</p><h2 id="What-language-do-they-speak-in-the-Netherlands"><a href="#What-language-do-they-speak-in-the-Netherlands" class="headerlink" title="What language do they speak in the Netherlands?"></a>What language do they speak in the Netherlands?</h2><p> If you read the above explanations, you probably already understand the rationale.<strong>People in the Netherlands speak the Dutch language.</strong></p><p> According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dutch-language" >Encyclopædia Britannica <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , <strong>in the Middle Ages, the Dutch language was called_Dietsc_ or</strong> <em><strong>Duutsc.</strong></em> As previously mentioned, this was historically equivalent to the German_Deutsch_ and simply meant “language of the people” (in contrast with Latin – the language of religion and learning).</p><p> The form_Duutsc_ was borrowed into English and thus gave birth to modern ‘Dutch’. What many don’t know is that <strong>the official name of the language is actually Nederlands or Netherlandic.</strong></p><p> However, to Dutch people, the language is also known as<strong>Hollands (Hollandish).</strong> This reflects the fact that the standard language is largely based on the dialect of the old province of Holland.</p><p> And become everyone seems to have a different name for Dutch people, their language and their country, it’s good to know that Belgians call the Dutch language ‘Flemish’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/language-in-the-netherlands-960x573.jpg"                      alt="language in the netherlands" title="Where Are Dutch People From?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Heart-of-Indonesia-Greetings-and-More"><a href="#The-Heart-of-Indonesia-Greetings-and-More" class="headerlink" title="The Heart of Indonesia: Greetings and More"></a>The Heart of Indonesia: Greetings and More</h2><p> Knowing how to say hello in Indonesian can make all the difference if you’re traveling to the Indonesian paradise. It’s true that tourism growth opened the area a lot and most locals speak English now, but Indonesian greetings are a nice way to break the ice. Throw in a smile and next thing you know, you’re friends with everyone!</p><p> Besides, you’ll love <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-6912&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6912?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=id&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6912?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=id" >learning Indonesian words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as some of them sound very cute to English speakers. Known as_Bahasa Indonesia_ to Indonesians, Indonesian calls the dolphin_lumba-lumba_ and the teeth_gigi_ . Cute. Told ‘ya!</p><h2 id="When-and-how-should-you-say-hello-in-Indonesia"><a href="#When-and-how-should-you-say-hello-in-Indonesia" class="headerlink" title="When and how should you say hello in Indonesia"></a>When and how should you say hello in Indonesia</h2><p> Unlike other Asian countries that place a big emphasis on the culture of respect, Indonesia doesn’t necessarily use honorifics. Besides, just like in English, Indonesian greetings don’t have formal variations for elders or those of a higher social status.</p><p> Therefore, <strong>you’ll use the same greetings regardless of age, social context or status.</strong></p><p> However, there are some things you need to remember. You won’t be sanctioned if you don’t respect the local etiquette, but it would be nice to offer your greetings to any older people present first, ideally without maintaining strong eye contact.</p><p> In fact, persistent eye contact is to be avoided when you shake hands as well. Unlike Westerners who like a firm handshake, Indonesians like their handshakes light and sometimes accompanied by a slight nod of the head.</p><p> Last but not least, if someone greets you using the_wai_ gesture (slight bow with the palms put together in front of the chest), you can show respect towards their culture by returning the same gesture.</p><h2 id="How-to-say-‘hello’-in-Indonesian"><a href="#How-to-say-‘hello’-in-Indonesian" class="headerlink" title="How to say ‘hello’ in Indonesian"></a>How to say ‘hello’ in Indonesian</h2><p> <strong>If you want to say ‘hello’ in Indonesian, you can simply say_halo_ .</strong> It’s short, sweet and almost identical to the English ‘hello’ you already know and use. Besides, it’s friendly and works great in most social situations.</p><p> In case you’re looking for a stronger conversation starter, you can also ask people about their day. “How are you?” is_apa kabar_ in Indonesian.</p><p> On the other hand, if someone asks you how you are doing, you can say_kabar baik,_ which means “I am fine” or “I am well”. Here’s what a basic conversation in Indonesian sounds like:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938716/19272" target="_top" id="1938716">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938716" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938716/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="‘Hi’-in-Indonesian"><a href="#‘Hi’-in-Indonesian" class="headerlink" title="‘Hi’ in Indonesian"></a>‘Hi’ in Indonesian</h3><p> Made some new friends during your trip to Bali?

While in English, we begin every such greeting with “good”, in Indonesian_selamat_ is the word we use to wish people a “happy”, “peaceful” or “safe” day.</p><ul><li><em>Selamat pagi!</em>  — Good morning!</li><li><em>Selamat siang!</em> — Good day!</li><li><em>Selamat sore!</em> — Good afternoon!</li><li><em>Selamat malam!</em> — Good evening!</li><li><em>Selamat tidur!</em> — Good night!</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/indonesian-words.png"                      alt="indonesian words" title="Hello In Indonesian: A Quick Guide To Indonesian Greetings 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111964/7443" target="_top" id="2111964">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111964" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111964/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The same way we say “morning!’ in English, Indonesians sometimes drop the_selamat_ . This results in a very informal greeting that can be used with friends and family.</p><p> Determining the correct time of the day during which you should use a certain greeting is somehow tricky. However, most people will agree that_selamat pagi_ is best used until 11 p.m. and_selamat siang_ until 3 p.m.<em>Selamat sore</em> and_selamat malam_ highly depend on the daylight so it’s best to adjust your greetings on the spot.</p><p> Naturally,<em>selamat tidur</em> is only used when someone is retiring for the night.</p><h2 id="How-to-say-goodbye"><a href="#How-to-say-goodbye" class="headerlink" title="How to say goodbye"></a>How to say goodbye</h2><p> Similarly, you can use_selamat tinggal_ if you’re ready to say ‘goodbye’ and leave. If you’re the one staying, you should say_selamat jalan,_ which has no direct translation in English.</p><p> Supposing you’re aiming for something a bit more informal, you can say s_ampai jumpa_ (“see you later”).</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/hello-in-indonesian/&t=Hello+in+Indonesian:+A+Quick+Guide+to+Indonesian+Greetings"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557743/17382" target="_top" id="1557743">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557743" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557743/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Start-learning-Indonesian-today"><a href="#Start-learning-Indonesian-today" class="headerlink" title="Start learning Indonesian today"></a>Start learning Indonesian today</h3><p> If learning how to say ‘hello’ in Indonesian made you realize you want to become fluent in Indonesian, this is your lucky day.

    <updated>2024-10-06T23:18:15.028Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Learn-German-With-Dark-on-Netflix"><a href="#Learn-German-With-Dark-on-Netflix" class="headerlink" title="Learn German With Dark on Netflix"></a>Learn German With Dark on Netflix</h2><p> I guess we can all agree on the fact Netflix is awesome. It personally makes me a bit antisocial because I often prefer to zombie-watch a series rather than go out, but let’s face it: if I would really – but REALLY – want to go out, I just would. But I don’t. I’m Netflix’s slave and I enjoy it.</p><p> As a matter of fact, watching carefully selected movies and TV shows has its perks. If you are a <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >movie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> geek (like me), then you know that you can sometimes fool people into thinking you are quite smart using only facts that you’ve learned from movies. Just add a bit of emotional intelligence and you’ve got yourself a little alter ego genius.</p><p> For instance, a foreign language is the kind of thing you can learn by watching certain TV shows or movies. That’s no fiction or lie. Because I was born in Europe, I can assure you that many of us learned English by watching cartoons in the early ’90s and that was some fun language training.</p><p> Back to our point of interest, Netflix has done it again with its first German-language original series called <a class="link"   href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5753856/?ref_=ttep_ep_tt" >Dark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . As <a class="link"   href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/1/16724852/netflix-dark-review-first-german-streaming-series" >The Verge <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> beautifully said: “Dark is hard to watch and impossible to stop watching”. That is why this show is guaranteed to make you crave more: more Dark and more German. The first season saw the thirst of Netflix’s subscribers in December 2017 and the next one began production a few weeks ago, on June 25. We will hopefully be able to watch the second season of this dark beauty – got that? – in early 2019.</p><p>Here’s the official trailer for the first season:</p><h2 id="The-Upside-Down-has-nothing-on-Winden"><a href="#The-Upside-Down-has-nothing-on-Winden" class="headerlink" title="The Upside Down has nothing on Winden"></a>The Upside Down has nothing on Winden</h2><p> Dark resembles Stranger Things a LOT. But it’s definitely better. If you are one of those people that would always prefer a European indie instead of a Hollywood blockbuster, Dark it’s just what you need. Filled with gorgeous shots, intense storytelling, and the perfect music, the German TV series sends shivers down your spine if you watch it at night when you are home alone.</p><p>While being indeed very similar to Stranger Things, Dark is at the same time very different in its complexity. If Stranger Things offers a visualization of the evil forces that rule Hawkins, Dark keeps you – and Winden (the city where the action takes place) – in total darkness for a long time. Using sound, rain, and a specific color palette, this series manages to achieve a sense of claustrophobia in the viewer. The screen is not a barrier anymore. It basically makes you fear the unknown. Baran bo Odar – the creator – uses the expectations people built watching these genres (thriller or horror) to induce a sense of anticipation every time a certain type of music can be heard in the background and that’s pretty amazing.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047351/19272" target="_top" id="2047351">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047351" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047351/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-Dark-all-about"><a href="#What-is-Dark-all-about" class="headerlink" title="What is Dark all about?"></a>What is Dark all about?</h2><p> The disappearance of two children in a Dark German town where some guy committed suicide seems to expose everything about the relationships among four families. The best part? Temporal loops. Maybe the best question the series offers is “when” and not “where”. And I’m gonna stop right there because I don’t want to ruin it for you.</p><p> Oh! Almost forgot! There’s also some young romantic tension involved. So far, so good. I mean… it has everything, doesn’t it?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xUOxfhJk0NqRxEiCOY/giphy.gif"                      alt="NETFLIX DARK GERMAN LANGUAGE" title="Learn German With Dark On Netflix 2"                ></p><h2 id="Why-am-I-going-to-love-the-German-language-after-watching-Dark"><a href="#Why-am-I-going-to-love-the-German-language-after-watching-Dark" class="headerlink" title="Why am I going to love the German language after watching Dark?"></a>Why am I going to love the German language after watching Dark?</h2><p> It’s a bit complicated and I’m going to shed some light on that in a minute. I don’t know how it is for you, but society and entertainment always seem to maintain and even solidify our preconceptions about the German language. Hitler spoke German. World War II started when Germany did what it did. We get it. But why do we keep putting a tag on Germany and Germans for that? Why do we live in the past? I’ve met a lot of people who associated the sound of the German language with the war. Is it the same for you? We have a lot of preconceptions, but this one is particularly hard to break.</p><p> The only way we will change the preconception we created is by getting in contact with Germany and the German language. And I’ve got to tell you: watching Dark is a great way to do that. It will blow your mind and you will become an instant fan of German cinema.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xUOxf8OrAxtKl1zlT2/giphy.gif"                      alt="JONAS DARK NETFLIX" title="Learn German With Dark On Netflix 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148643/16836" target="_top" id="2148643">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148643" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="75"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148643/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> I personally wanted to learn German for a long time, but I would always give up on the second day.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Learn-the-Days-of-the-Week-in-German"><a href="#Learn-the-Days-of-the-Week-in-German" class="headerlink" title="Learn the Days of the Week in German"></a>Learn the Days of the Week in German</h2><p> If someone asks_welchen Wochentag haben wir heute?_ (“which day of the week do we have today?”), what do you answer? The days of the week are probably one of the first things you learn not just in German but in any language. As a toddler, you probably started with “mom”, “dad”, “hello”, and “thank you”, then you probably advanced to counting, colors, and, naturally, the days of the week. So, if you are on your way to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learning German <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the days of the week in German are surely a good starting point.</p><p> If you think about it, the_Tage_ (days) of the_Woche_ (week) is one of the most basic and important language lessons. Simply knowing these seven short words will help you set up meetings, and dates and create a weekly agenda that will decide your every social and professional move. After all, our entire life revolves around the concept of time and the many ways we keep track of it: seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, and so on. So let’s help you get started and see which are the weekdays in German.</p><h2 id="The-days-of-the-week-in-German"><a href="#The-days-of-the-week-in-German" class="headerlink" title="The days of the week in German"></a>The days of the week in German</h2><p>To go straight to the point, the days of the week in German are:</p><ul><li><strong>Monday – <em>Montag</em></strong></li><li><strong>Tuesday – <em>Dienstag</em></strong></li><li><strong>Wednesday – <em>Mittwoch</em></strong></li><li><strong>Thursday – <em>Donnerstag</em></strong></li><li><strong>Friday – <em>Freitag</em></strong></li><li><strong>Saturday – <em>Samstag</em></strong></li><li><strong>Sunday – <em>Sonntag</em></strong></li></ul><p> Every German weekday (except, of course, Wednesday or_Mittwoch_) ends with_tag_ which you already know from_Guten Tag_ that it means “day”.</p><p> To make German weekdays even easier to remember, let’s get into a little etymology. For example,<em><strong>Montag</strong></em> which is<strong>“Monday”</strong> in German comes from the German word_Mond_ (“moon”). So Monday in German is literally “moon-day”.</p><p><em><strong>Dienstag</strong></em> <strong>(“Tuesday”)</strong> on the other hand has connections to the old Germanic god Týr which was the god concerned with the formalities of war (especially treaties) and also of justice. Dienstag was considered Týr’s day which sounds like “Tuesday” because this is actually where “Tuesday” comes from as well. As you already know, English is a Germanic language so there are many similarities between modern-day German and English.</p><p><em><strong>Mittwoch</strong></em> , the only German weekday that doesn’t end in_tag_ , simply means “midweek”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/days-of-the-week-in-german-960x960.jpg"                      alt="days of the week in German" title="Learn The Days Of The Week In German 2"                ></p><p> The days of the week in German</p><p><strong>“Thursday”</strong> which is_<strong>Donnerstag</strong>_ in German literally means “thunder’s day”. The day was originally named after Thor, the super awesome Norse god Marvel made famous. In German-speaking cultures, Thor was known as Donar so this is where_Donnerstag_ comes from. Obviously, the English word “Thursday” comes from “Thor’s day”.</p><p> Both_<strong>Freitag</strong>_ and<strong>“Friday”</strong> are connected to the goddess Frige (or Frigg in Norse).

And that’s only natural. <strong>Humanity’s most foundational knowledge was first articulated in the ancient Greek language.</strong> Whether we’re talking about Plato’s dialogues, Homer’s_Iliad_ , or the forward-looking explorations in science, astronomy, and mathematics, we owe a lot to ancient Greece and its language.</p><p> So, let’s embark on a journey through time and explore the history of the ancient Greek language. We will look at its profound impact on modern languages and culture and how it differs from modern Greek. With a little help from the Greek gods and goddesses, you’ll see that ancient Greek is not a relic of the past but a living legacy echoing everywhere in the modern world.</p><p> Men think about the Roman Empire a lot, but I believe ancient Greece is just as fascinating. What do you think?</p><h2 id="Ancient-Greek-Language-–-Historical-Journey"><a href="#Ancient-Greek-Language-–-Historical-Journey" class="headerlink" title="Ancient Greek Language – Historical Journey"></a>Ancient Greek Language – Historical Journey</h2><p> Stretching over millennia, <strong>the historical journey of the ancient Greek language can be considered as epic as Homer’s_Odyssey_ .</strong> Spoken by some of the most influential people in human history, ancient Greek has known the world in a way we never will.</p><p> But before going over its tale, a clarification needs to be made. When we say “ancient Greek”, most think of the language spoken before our era. However, what we call “ancient Greek” is actually just a phase in the evolution of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Greek-language" >Greek language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The periods in which the Greek language was divided are:</p><ul><li><strong>Proto-Greek:</strong> This is the earliest form of Greek that was not directly attested but inferred.</li><li><strong>Mycenaean Greek:</strong> Dating from the 16th to 12th centuries BC, it’s the most ancient attested form of Greek.</li><li><strong>Ancient Greek:</strong> Used during the “Dark Ages” and Classical periods (1200-300 BC), this version of Greek was spoken widely across regions and was used in literature and philosophy.</li><li><strong>Hellenistic Greek (Koine):</strong> A common dialect that evolved following Alexander the Great’s conquests. It was the lingua franca across the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East and the language of the Christian New Testament.</li><li><strong>Medieval Greek:</strong> Spanned from the 5th to 6th centuries to the 15th century, representing the language of the Byzantine Empire.</li><li><strong>Modern Greek:</strong> This is the contemporary version of Greek, influenced by historical events like the Ottoman rule and the establishment of the modern Greek state. The language underwent purification, removing foreign influences, and there were debates over its official form.</li></ul><p> <strong>The Greek language has one of the longest written records of any language,</strong> first appearing in a syllabic script on clay tablets from the 14th-13th centuries BCE and resurfacing after a four-century gap in the Greek alphabet. It belongs to the<strong>Indo-European family of languages,</strong> which includes Sanskrit, Latin, and Germanic languages, tracing back to a common ancestor, Proto-Indo-European.</p><p> Spanning an oral tradition of 4,000 years and a written tradition of 3,500 years, Greek boasts the lengthiest lineage among Indo-European languages, making it one of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >oldest languages in the world <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Many consider it unique due to its unbroken historical continuity and we can’t help but agree!</p><h3 id="Ancient-Greek-–-the-language-of-the-Homeric-Poems"><a href="#Ancient-Greek-–-the-language-of-the-Homeric-Poems" class="headerlink" title="Ancient Greek – the language of the Homeric Poems"></a>Ancient Greek – the language of the Homeric Poems</h3><p> Ancient Greek, the language of the “Dark Ages” and the Archaic and Classical periods (1200-300 BCE), emerged following the fall of the Mycenaean civilization. Despite the abandonment of the standardized Mycenaean language, local vernacular dialects persisted and evolved into various Greek dialects over time.</p><p> These dialects were significantly influenced by social interactions, economic activities, tribal mixings, and conflicts, leading to a collective linguistic and cultural consciousness among the Greek people. Ancient Greek dialects heavily influenced the era’s literature, with each piece closely tied to a specific dialect that reflected the Greek tribe and its unique socio-economic contexts.</p><p> Ancient Greek writing during this archaic period featured the “Boustrophedon” style (literally “ox-turning”, after the manner of an ox plowing a field), where alternate lines of text were reversed, a technique observed in earlier civilizations. Nevertheless, around the 8th century BC, the Greek alphabet was standardized.</p><h3 id="Dialects-of-Ancient-Greece"><a href="#Dialects-of-Ancient-Greece" class="headerlink" title="Dialects of Ancient Greece"></a>Dialects of Ancient Greece</h3><p> <strong>Before the conquest by the Macedonians in the late 4th century BCE, there was no unified Greek language;</strong> rather, various competing dialects existed. Each city or region had its standard for inscriptions, and though these dialects were diverse, the Greeks had a concept of a shared linguistic identity and could understand other dialects.</p><p> These dialects, including Attic and Ionic, Aeolic, Arcadocypriot, and Doric, with sub-dialects like Macedonian Greek, resulted from the Greek tribes’ geographic dispersion, varied settlement locations, and political autonomy.</p><p> Naturally, this complex linguistic landscape, characterized by many dialects and writing styles, highlights nothing more than the rich diversity and evolution of the ancient Greek language.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080347/19272" target="_top" id="2080347">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080347" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080347/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Iconic-texts-written-in-the-ancient-Greek-language"><a href="#Iconic-texts-written-in-the-ancient-Greek-language" class="headerlink" title="Iconic texts written in the ancient Greek language"></a>Iconic texts written in the ancient Greek language</h3><p> <strong>The most important pieces of writing we have from this period are the Homeric Poems:<em>The Iliad</em> and_The Odyssey_ .</strong> The two epic poems are foundational to Greek education and culture and remain pivotal works in European literary tradition.<em>The Iliad</em> narrates the rage of Achilles during the Trojan War, while_The Odyssey_ follows Odysseus’s journey home after the war. Over time, the composition methods of these epics have been a subject of extensive debate between experts.</p><p>Other literary works of art representative of this period include:</p><ul><li><strong>Plato’s Dialogues</strong></li><li><strong>Sappho’s poems</strong></li><li><strong>Herodotus’ Histories</strong></li><li><strong>Euripides’ tragedies</strong></li><li><strong>Aesop’s fables</strong></li><li><strong>Sophocles’ tragedies</strong></li></ul><p> Many of these names seem familiar because their works were so forward-looking they are still relevant today. Ancient Greece has not only inspired epic tales but has also infused the Western ethos with archetypal narratives, symbolic imagery and food for thought for millennia to come. Now you see why this period in time is so talked about!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ancient-greece-language.jpg"                      alt="ancient greece language" title="Ancient Greek Language Influence On Modern Languages 6"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902324/19272" target="_top" id="1902324">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902324" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902324/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Ancient-Greek-Writing-System-and-Alphabet"><a href="#Ancient-Greek-Writing-System-and-Alphabet" class="headerlink" title="Ancient Greek Writing System and Alphabet"></a>Ancient Greek Writing System and Alphabet</h2><p> Did you know the word <strong>‘alphabet’ originates from the initial two letters of the Greek alphabet,<em>‘alpha’</em> and_‘beta’_ ?</strong> While this may seem like a fun piece of unimportant trivia, you’ll soon discover that the influence of the ancient Greek language on modern languages is far greater than we think.</p><p> The Greek alphabet, a symphony of symbols, laid the foundational notes for the Latin, Cyrillic, Armenian, Coptic, and Gothic writing systems, among many others. Used for approximately 2,800 years to this day, it is the earliest known alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels and consonants. Greeks adopted and adapted it from the earlier Phoenician alphabet.</p><p> However, the earliest attested form of the Greek language is a clay tablet written in the Linear B script. Historians claim that it dates to between 1450 and 1350 BC. Unrelated to the Greek alphabet, which emerged around the 8th century BC, Linear B last appeared in the 13th century BC. The centuries between the two writing scripts, where no Greek writings have been found, is referred to as the Greek Dark Ages.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151864/7443" target="_top" id="2151864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151864/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Cultural-Influences-of-Ancient-Greek-on-the-Western-Civilization"><a href="#Cultural-Influences-of-Ancient-Greek-on-the-Western-Civilization" class="headerlink" title="Cultural Influences of Ancient Greek on the Western Civilization"></a>Cultural Influences of Ancient Greek on the Western Civilization</h2><p> Ancient Greece’s influence on Western civilization is undeniable, and you’ll soon see why. For example, where do you think the Olympic Games came from? Or where did democracy originate? They’re both products of Ancient Greece, of course!</p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Greece/The-Olympic-Games" >The Ancient Olympic Games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> were held at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece,</strong> every four years. Unsurprisingly, the origins of the Ancient Olympics are rooted in myth and legend, notably involving Hercules and Zeus. It’s believed Hercules (or Heracles) named the Games ‘Olympic’ and introduced the tradition of hosting them every four years. After finishing his twelve labors, Hercules supposedly built the Olympic Stadium to honor Zeus. He then marked a distance called “stadion” after walking 200 steps, which became a unit of measurement.</p><p> We can’t know how much of this is true. But one thing we know for sure: <strong>inscriptions at Olympia place the inception of the Ancient Olympics in 776 BC.</strong> Apparently, they reached their peak somewhere between the 6th and 5th centuries BCE and then slowly declined in significance as the Romans gained influence in Greece.</p><p> From politics and governance to philosophy and science, Greek terminologies and ideas laid the foundations for Western thought. Words like ‘democracy’, ‘philosophy’, and ‘astronomy’ are testimonials of Ancient Greek’s influence on today’s world. But let’s go into a little more detail.</p><h3 id="Ancient-Greek-influence-on-governance-and-philosophy"><a href="#Ancient-Greek-influence-on-governance-and-philosophy" class="headerlink" title="Ancient Greek influence on governance and philosophy"></a>Ancient Greek influence on governance and philosophy</h3><p> Given the fact that democracy and republicanism originated in ancient Greece, it’s no wonder that the lexicon of modern governance is replete with Greek-rooted words.</p><p> The principles of Western political thought were shaped by the Greek ideals of democracy, rooted in the philosophies of thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates. More precisely, <strong>the ideas laid out in Aristotle’s_Politics_ have become integral to how modern societies practice democracy.</strong></p><p> At the same time, the ideas of these influential thinkers on logic, ethics, and metaphysics also continue to influence contemporary philosophical debates and guide our exploration of fundamental questions about existence, morality, and the nature of reality. Their brilliant minds concocted theses that are still relevant millennia later. Isn’t it mind-blowing?</p><p> If you had any doubts about ancient Greece’s influence, know that the word ‘philosophy’ itself is of Greek origin. It is derived from ‘philosophia’, which means “love of wisdom”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/themes/mondly/img/mondly-banner-icon.png"                      alt="mondly banner icon" title="Ancient Greek Language Influence On Modern Languages 7"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105882/7443" target="_top" id="2105882">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105882" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105882/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h5 id="Learn-the-language-of-the-Greek-gods"><a href="#Learn-the-language-of-the-Greek-gods" class="headerlink" title="Learn the language of the Greek gods"></a>Learn the language of the Greek gods</h5><p> If Zeus needed to improve his Modern Greek, he’d probably choose Mondly.

The epic tales of gods, goddesses, demigods, and heroes have inspired numerous artists, writers, and thinkers to create their next big work of art. If you look into it, you’ll see that the influence of Greek myths can still be found everywhere, from literature and sculpture to popular culture and advertising.</p><p> At the same time, the ancient Greek epics and plays are also foundational for Western literature. Some of the most popular tragedies and comedies in history are still those of ancient Greece. Examples include<strong>the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides</strong> and<strong>the comedies of Aristophanes.</strong></p><p> Just as significant for the modern world are the ancient Greek art and architecture. The principles of symmetry, harmony, and proportionality influenced Western architectural designs, including the construction of monuments and public buildings. The Greek column, for example, is a beloved element we’ve seen even in fashion!</p><h3 id="Ancient-Greek-influence-on-science-and-mathematics"><a href="#Ancient-Greek-influence-on-science-and-mathematics" class="headerlink" title="Ancient Greek influence on science and mathematics"></a>Ancient Greek influence on science and mathematics</h3><p> If we ask scientists, they’ll say that ancient Greeks made their most significant contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. For example, <strong>the principles and theorems formulated by Pythagoras are integral to the scientific heritage that has shaped Western civilization.</strong> Nowadays, children as young as 12 or 13 learn Pythagoras’ theorems in geometry – which, by the way, is another word of Greek origin.</p><p> Another excellent example of how the great thinkers of ancient Greece influenced the way our world looks like today is Hippocrates. Considered<strong>the “Father of Modern Medicine”, Hippocrates’</strong> name is well-known even by those not familiar with medical practices due to his famous ethics oath called<strong>the Hippocratic Oath.</strong> Initially, the oath mandated a new physician to vow, invoking several healing deities, to adhere to particular ethical guidelines. It represents the Western world’s first articulation of medical ethics, laying down foundational principles that continue to be critically important even in today’s medical ethics.</p><p> As you can see, Ancient Greece’s cultural influence is a treasure trove of wisdom that continues to inspire and shape the Western world to this day. These were only a few of the ideas and personalities that persisted through the ages. If you care to study the entire period of Ancient Greece, you’ll discover that many more people thought, said, or did great things during this time. So many that we start to wonder whether they had access to a magical fountain of endless inspiration!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ancient-greek-vs-modern-greek.jpg"                      alt="ancient Greek vs modern Greek" title="Ancient Greek Language Influence On Modern Languages 8"                ></p><h2 id="Ancient-Greek-Language-Influence-on-Modern-Languages"><a href="#Ancient-Greek-Language-Influence-on-Modern-Languages" class="headerlink" title="Ancient Greek Language Influence on Modern Languages"></a>Ancient Greek Language Influence on Modern Languages</h2><p> Now that you have an overview of the intellectual and artistic heritage we received from ancient Greece, it’s time to take an even closer look at languages. Because yes, the Ancient Greek language has carved its imprints not just in the annals of history but in the very syntax and semantics of modern languages. <strong>English, Spanish, and French are probably the most important bearers of Greek influences.</strong></p><p> Whenever you say a word like ‘psychology’, ‘theater’, or ‘chronology’, you pay tribute to the ancient Greek language. Still, the linguistic legacy is not limited to vocabulary but extends to idiomatic expressions, grammatical structures, and even rhetorical styles. Keep in mind the fact that this influence happened despite the geographical distance between ancient Greece and the English-speaking world.</p><h3 id="Enriching-the-modern-lexicon"><a href="#Enriching-the-modern-lexicon" class="headerlink" title="Enriching the modern lexicon"></a>Enriching the modern lexicon</h3><p> So, how does the ancient Greek language live on through the modern languages? Well, as we already settled, one of the most striking manifestations of its influence is on the vocabulary. The terms beginning with ‘ph-’ are probably the most obvious examples. <strong>Words like ‘philosophy’, ‘physical’, ‘photograph’, ‘phrase’, and ‘philanthropy’ all have roots in ancient Greek.</strong></p><p> What’s more, they are all very similar in all major languages. Let’s take ‘geography’ for instance. The word came in English from French, which in turn got it from Latin. Finally, Latin borrowed the word from the Greek_geōgraphia,_ with_gē_ meaning ‘earth’ and_-graphia_ meaning ‘writing’. A fascinating journey to be had for a single word! Now, if you look at how to say ‘geography’ in different languages, you’ll notice that all of them are very similar:</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >French <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> : <em>géographie</em></li><li>German: <em>Geografie</em></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> : <em>geografía</em></li></ul><p> As you can see, <strong>ancient Greek words have infiltrated the English language through a complex route, often via Latin and French,</strong> but their imprint is unmistakable. Although modern English contains numerous borrowed words from languages such as French, Italian, and Spanish, a significant portion of them actually originate from ancient Greek.</p><p> This is just one example among countless others where a modern English word owes its existence to Ancient Greek ancestry. As a matter of fact, it’s estimated that <strong>more than 150,000 English words can be traced back to their Greek origins.</strong></p><h2 id="English-words-of-Greek-origin"><a href="#English-words-of-Greek-origin" class="headerlink" title="English words of Greek origin"></a>English words of Greek origin</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>English word</strong></th><th><strong>Greek origin</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>biology</td><td>from ‘bios’ (life) + ‘logia’ (study), referring to the study of life and living organisms</td></tr><tr><td>mathematics</td><td>from ‘máthēma’ meaning ‘that which is learnt’</td></tr><tr><td>astronomy</td><td>from the adjective ‘astronomos’ meaning ‘star-arranging’</td></tr><tr><td>philosophy</td><td>from ‘philos’ (love) + ‘sophia’ (wisdom), meaning the love of wisdom</td></tr><tr><td>psychology</td><td>from ‘psyche’ (soul) + ‘logia’ (study), referring to the study of the soul</td></tr><tr><td>politics</td><td>from ‘politiká’ meaning ‘affairs of the cities’</td></tr><tr><td>democracy</td><td>from ‘dēmos’ (people) + ‘kratia’ (power or rule), signifying a system where power is vested in the people</td></tr><tr><td>anatomy</td><td>from ‘ana’ (up) + ‘tomia’ (cutting) meaning dissection, it refers to the study of the body’s structure</td></tr><tr><td>academy</td><td>from Akadēmos, the hero after whom Plato’s garden was named</td></tr><tr><td>bibliography</td><td>from ‘biblion’ (book) + ‘graphia’ (writing), referring to the listing of books and other written works</td></tr><tr><td>chronology</td><td>from ‘chronos’ (time) + ‘logia’ (study), it refers to the arrangement of events in time order</td></tr><tr><td>dinosaur</td><td>from ‘deinos’ (terrible) + ‘sauros’ (lizard)</td></tr><tr><td>telephone</td><td>from ‘tēle’ (far) + ‘phonē’ (sound)</td></tr><tr><td>atmosphere</td><td>from ‘atmos’ (vapor) + “sphaira” (sphere)</td></tr><tr><td>theology</td><td>from ‘theos’ (god) + ‘logia’ (study)</td></tr><tr><td>cardiology</td><td>from ‘kardiā’ (heart) + ‘logia’ (study)</td></tr><tr><td>technology</td><td>from ‘tekhnē’ (art, craft) + ‘logia’ (study)</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/798161/11305" target="_top" id="798161">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-798161" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i110150.net/i/5597632/798161/11305"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Expressions-that-originated-from-Greek"><a href="#Expressions-that-originated-from-Greek" class="headerlink" title="Expressions that originated from Greek"></a>Expressions that originated from Greek</h2><p> Apart from <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Latin phrases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the only thing that can make you sound like a true erudite without much work are the expressions that originated from Greek.</p><p> As we already discussed, ancient Greece and its fascinating mythology have been very influential in Western culture.

Achilles’ heel</h3><p><em>Describes a weakness in spite of overall great strength or resilience.</em></p><p> According to the legend, Achilles’ mother, Thetis, dipped him into the River Styx to prevent his foretold death.

Overcome by curiosity, Pandora opens the box, releasing all the world’s troubles.

Remorseful and devastated, Hercules sought out Apollo, the god of truth and healing and another son of Zeus, pleading to be penalized for his actions.</p><p> Thus, he was tasked with completing twelve extremely challenging “labors”. These labors included daunting tasks such as retrieving the guardian dog from the underworld and defeating the multi-headed Hydra.

Thus, the transition from the ancient Greek language to the modern Greek language was all about adaptation and evolution. The language spoken in Plato’s Greece is indeed very different from the language spoken today in Greece. However, it is said that <strong>a person proficient in Modern Greek can generally understand about 50% of ancient Greek texts</strong> due to similar root words.</p><p> So, how different is ancient Greek from modern Greek? Let’s take a closer look.</p><ul><li><strong>Phonetics:</strong> The evolution from Ancient to Modern Greek involved significant phonetic and semantic changes, affecting both the sound and meaning of words. For example, Ancient Greek featured long and short vowels (which were important for poetry), various diphthongs, single and double consonants, and different types of stops. In contrast, modern Greek now has only short vowels and consonants. In addition, the pronunciation of several combinations of vowels (diphthongs) has also changed.</li><li><strong>Grammar:</strong> Ancient Greek had five cases and features like a dual number to refer to pairs and specific moods for desires and self-affected actions. Modern Greek, on the other hand, retains the dative case only in specific expressions and has dropped the dual number. Besides, certain verb forms and moods present in Ancient Greek are absent.</li><li><strong>Orthography:</strong> While ancient Greek used the polytonic orthography with many accents and only capital letters, modern Greek keeps only two <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek%5Fdiacritics" >diacritics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and uses both small and capital letters like in English.</li></ul><p> All in all, the transformation from ancient to modern Greek is characterized by a movement towards phonetic, grammatical, and semantic simplification while retaining core elements of the language’s rich history.</p><p> To summarize everything we learned about the ancient Greek language, let’s look at some frequently asked questions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094429/7443" target="_top" id="2094429">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094429" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094429/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Is-ancient-Greek-still-spoken-today"><a href="#Is-ancient-Greek-still-spoken-today" class="headerlink" title="Is ancient Greek still spoken today?"></a>Is ancient Greek still spoken today?</h3><p> Just like Latin, the ancient Greek language is still used in scholarly circles and ecclesiastical domains, preserved in texts and liturgies.

But there are also words you_only_ <em>think</em> you know. Words like_embarazada_ . And well… that’s where you could get in trouble.</p><p> Luckily, we are coming to your aid with a comprehensive list of some of the most common English-Spanish cognates and false Spanish cognates. Read on to understand the differences and choose the correct words for your next conversation in Spanish.</p><h2 id="What-are-cognates-false-cognates-and-false-friends"><a href="#What-are-cognates-false-cognates-and-false-friends" class="headerlink" title="What are cognates, false cognates and false friends?"></a>What are cognates, false cognates and false friends?</h2><p> In linguistics,<strong>cognates</strong> are known as words from different languages that have the same root or origin and share the same meaning. For example, when it comes to English-Spanish cognates, the common root comes from Latin and&#x2F;or Greek.</p><p> As an English speaker wanting to learn Spanish, cognates give you a huge advantage when it comes to your <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Spanish vocabulary <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Simply identifying the words that share similar spelling and meaning in English and Spanish gives you access to hundreds or maybe thousands of words you already know and could use.</p><p> Not to be confused with false friends,<strong>false cognates</strong> are words that sound and look similar but do not come from a common root. For example, the English “much” and the Spanish “mucho” are phonetically and semantically similar but came from completely different Proto-Indo-European roots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/false-friends-words-600x399.jpg"                      alt="false friends words" title="50+ Most Popular English-Spanish Cognates And False Cognates 2"                ></p><p> “We are not false friends!” by Alvan Nee©</p><p> Last, but definitely not least,<strong>false friends</strong> are the trouble-makers that sound and look similar, but have completely different meanings. This is obviously the case of the Spanish word_embarazada_ which may look like the English “embarrassed” but actually translates to “pregnant”.</p><p> Do not worry though! In the following paragraphs, we will cover all the Spanish-English false friends you absolutely need to know in order to avoid… embarrassing situations.</p><h2 id="Perfect-English-Spanish-cognates"><a href="#Perfect-English-Spanish-cognates" class="headerlink" title="Perfect English-Spanish cognates"></a>Perfect English-Spanish cognates</h2><p> The easiest Spanish cognates are those with no spelling changes. These are called “perfect cognates” because they are written the same in both English and Spanish. Nevertheless, as you might guess, the Spanish pronunciation is different.</p><p> Some of the most popular examples are: <em>hospital, horrible, actor, artificial, agenda, animal, original, idea, flexible, vulnerable, superficial, reunion</em> (<em>reunión</em> in Spanish)<em>, melon, interminable, inevitable, tropical, experimental, excursion</em> (<em>excursión</em> in Spanish)<em>, capital, chocolate, probable, conclusion</em> (<em>conclusión</em> in Spanish) <em>, doctor, director, festival, general, individual, nostalgia, panorama, television</em> (<em>televisión</em> in Spanish)<em>, perfume, total, similar, terror</em> and_verbal._</p><h2 id="Near-perfect-English-Spanish-cognates"><a href="#Near-perfect-English-Spanish-cognates" class="headerlink" title="Near-perfect English-Spanish cognates"></a>Near-perfect English-Spanish cognates</h2><p> Did you know that about 90% of Spanish cognates have the same meaning in English? The rest of them are, obviously, false friends words. This means you have only a 10% chance of saying something embarrassing or awkward. That’s not too bad, isn’t it? Besides, after reading this article the percent will surely drop significantly. Even below 0 if you also start <a class="link"

As already mentioned, these words may be similar but have completely meanings. So don’t let yourself be fooled by their appearance. Here’s a list of some of the most “dangerous” pairs of false friend words:</p><ul><li><strong><em>embarazada</em> and embarrassed</strong></li></ul><p> This definitely needs another mention. Although it looks a lot like embarrassed,<em>embarazada</em> actually means “pregnant” in Spanish.</p><ul><li><strong><em>pie</em> and pie</strong></li></ul><p> They may be written exactly the same, but the Spanish “pie” is pronounced_pee-eh_ and translates to “foot”. That’s surely not a confusion you’d want to make, is it?‌</p><ul><li><strong><em>recordar</em> and record</strong></li></ul><p> In Spanish, to remember something is_recordar_ (<em>Debo recordar lavar los platos –</em> I must remember to do the dishes). If you want to use the verb “to record” in Spanish, the word you are looking for is_grabar_ .</p><ul><li><strong><em>molestar</em> and molest</strong></li></ul><p> Contrary to its appearance,<em>molestar</em> in Spanish means “to annoy”. Phew, this is a really nasty one! Suddenly, what your Spanish colleague said about the boss makes a lot more sense (hahaha).</p><ul><li><strong><em>delito</em> and delight</strong></li></ul><p> Coming from the Latin_dēlictum_ (“crime, misdeed”),<em>delito</em> actually translates to “crime” in Spanish.</p><ul><li><strong><em>largo</em> and large</strong></li></ul><p> Even experienced Spanish second-language speakers get headaches with this one. Although it looks like the English “large”,<em>largo</em> actually means “long” in Spanish. Mind-twisting, I know.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/false-cognates-600x400.jpg"                      alt="false cognates" title="50+ Most Popular English-Spanish Cognates And False Cognates 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902278/19272" target="_top" id="1902278">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902278" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902278/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> “Haha! Gotcha!” by olio creative©</p><ul><li><strong><em>enviar</em> and to envy</strong></li></ul><p> Coming from Late Latin_inviāre_ , which is derived from Latin_via_ (“path, road”),<em>enviar</em> means “to send” in Spanish. You can also keep in mind the fact that it looks a lot like Portuguese_enviar_ , French_envoyer_ , Italian_inviare_ .</p><ul><li><strong><em>asistir</em> and assist</strong></li></ul><p> While “to assist” means “to help”, the Spanish_asistir_ means “to attend”.</p><ul><li><strong><em>ropa</em> and rope</strong></li></ul><p> Actually sharing a common root with the English “robe”,<em>ropa</em> translates to “clothes”. So yeah,<em>abuela</em> didn’t put the rope in the washing machine, but the clothes.</p><ul><li><strong><em>éxito</em> and exit</strong></li></ul><p> Imagine the bewilderment on someone’s face when you exit the cinema and ask them_“donde esta el éxito?”_ . It might get philosophical really fast.

The language spectrum is wider here, as opposed to Europe for example. The collection of Asian languages includes Sino -Tibetan, Austronesian, Dravidian, Altaic and countless others. By the way, English is also spoken fluently as a second language in many countries in Asia. So, if you’re planning a trip to Asia, or wishing to study there, it’s about time you found out which are the most popular Asian languages!</p><p> The list has been put together by looking at the most common languages spoken in Asia, but also the most popular Asian and Pacific Island languages popular in the US and Europe and the most popular Asian languages for business. How to learn Asian languages? <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-6345&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6345&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6345" >Mondly’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> got your back!</p><p> So, without further ado, let’s discover which are the most popular Asian languages today!</p><h2 id="1-Chinese-Mandarin"><a href="#1-Chinese-Mandarin" class="headerlink" title="1.

Mandarin is the most spoken dialect and China’s official language. It belongs to the Sino-Tibetan language family and is somewhat similar to Cantonese.</p><p> Other known dialects are Cantonese, Hokkien, Xiang, Hakka, Min, Wu, and Yue. You should know that the language has over 100.000 special characters, which are called logograms, and its speakers use four distinct tones to communicate. There is also a neutral tone and each one of the five is used in order to differentiate between words. At least, all the dialects use the same writing system, phew… Don’t worry, we’ll start you off with something easy like <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >“hello” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >“thank you” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Chinese is also the third most common foreign language in the United States, with approximately 3.4 million speakers. By the way, it’s very possible that China will become the strongest economy by 2050, so you’d better <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >start learning Chinese online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  soon.

This Indo-Aryan derived language is spoken by approximately 550 million people, including here the residents of Fiji. Written in the Devanagari script, Hindi is also spoken by some 81 million people in the US. If you are a fan of Bollywood, this is the language for you!</p><p> Coming from Sanskrit, Hindi is the fourth most-spoken native language in the world, behind Chinese, Spanish and English, and it’s also incredibly similar to Urdu. The two languages are so similar that two speakers of Urdu and Hindi can understand each other without issues! Even though it is the most popular language in India, it is not in fact the national language. This is due to the fact that the Indian constitution does not specify a national language as such. By the way, Hindi is also one of the easiest languages to learn by English speakers, so you should definitely give it a go!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137216/26400" target="_top" id="2137216">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137216" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137216/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Indonesian"><a href="#3-Indonesian" class="headerlink" title="3.

To be more precise, Indonesian is actually considered a dialect of Malay, with differences mainly when it comes to accent and vocabulary.</p><p> However, natives can certainly distinguish between the two with ease. Good news for the language enthusiasts, Indonesian uses Latin script, which makes it one of the least challenging Asian languages to learn. Another interesting fact is that Indonesian is the third most used language in WordPress, with an astounding 1.5 million blogs written in this language.</p><p> With 240 million speakers in Asia alone, Indonesian is actually more popular than Korean (sorry <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Squid Game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  fans) or Japanese, even though it’s hard to believe.

But that doesn’t mean there aren’t any pick up lines in German. Of course, there are! Many people speak German. Some of them must have thought of a couple of German pick up lines, right? Well, yes. The German language does have quite a lot of conversation openers you can use during your next trip to Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol (Italy), Belgium, or Liechtenstein. Let’s see which they are. Happy flirting in German!</p><h2 id="Funny-Pick-Up-Lines-in-German"><a href="#Funny-Pick-Up-Lines-in-German" class="headerlink" title="Funny Pick Up Lines in German"></a>Funny Pick Up Lines in German</h2><ul><li><em>Glaubst du an Liebe auf den ersten Blick?

However, if you do it right, you can win their heart forever. In this particular situation (flirting with a German man), context is crucial. Do you know anything about them? Do they like beer or football? We assume every German man does, but in reality, things are a little more complicated. Don’t assume things, or you might end up hurting or offending them.</p><p> On the other hand, if they do like football and you decide to use a football-themed pick up line on them, you may just score a goal!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1834906">                    <video width="864" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834906.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1834906">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834906.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1834906%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1834906/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Pick-Up-Lines-for-Girls-in-Germany"><a href="#Best-Pick-Up-Lines-for-Girls-in-Germany" class="headerlink" title="Best Pick Up Lines for Girls in Germany"></a>Best Pick Up Lines for Girls in Germany</h2><ul><li><em>Bist du ein Berliner Pfannkuchen?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Tapping-Into-AI’s-Capabilities-for-Academic-Advancement"><a href="#Tapping-Into-AI’s-Capabilities-for-Academic-Advancement" class="headerlink" title="Tapping Into AI’s Capabilities for Academic Advancement"></a>Tapping Into AI’s Capabilities for Academic Advancement</h2><p> The positive impact of AI in education is only starting to show. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been blowing off our minds for a while now, and this is only the beginning. As it continues to get smarter every day, we will soon have a more personalized learning experience than we have ever imagined. Before the pandemic, we may have been reluctant to adopt AI in education, but not anymore. Today, more and more people are starting to see the benefits of using AI to help humanity learn faster.</p><p> But what exactly is AI? Well, who better to ask that if not AI itself? Here’s what <a class="link"   href="https://openai.com/" >OpenAI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> said: “AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines that can think and act like humans. AI systems are designed to learn from their environment, recognize patterns, and adapt to changing situations. AI is used in a variety of industries, including healthcare, finance, and robotics.”</p><h2 id="The-future-of-AI-in-education"><a href="#The-future-of-AI-in-education" class="headerlink" title="The future of AI in education"></a>The future of AI in education</h2><p> Let’s set the record straight right from the start:<strong>AI didn’t write these words. A human did.</strong> A human who has no reason to exaggerate the importance of AI. While some of us may be biased, fearing that AI will one day replace us, we have to stop for a second and reflect. Rather than replace real people, AI will enhance the efficacy and speed of our efforts, at least for now.</p><p> When it comes to education, the advantages are astounding. Just the other day, I used an AI-powered app to talk to Mozart. Just imagine that! I asked about his relationship with Antonio Salieri, his favorite piece he had ever composed and more. I was so self-aware that I even asked if he was bothered by my many questions.</p><p> However, talking to influential people in history to broaden your knowledge of different domains is just the tip of the iceberg. Here are just a few of<strong>the benefits of AI in education.</strong></p><h3 id="Instant-feedback-for-students"><a href="#Instant-feedback-for-students" class="headerlink" title="Instant feedback for students"></a>Instant feedback for students</h3><p> Having 25 students in your class makes it virtually impossible to give real-time feedback to everyone. Then it’s also the matter of the tests. Teachers spend hours correcting and grading for just one class. Meanwhile, as a student, waiting for an important test result can be stressful. And when it finally arrives, you no longer remember your answer, so it’s hard to know what area you should improve.</p><p> Nevertheless, using AI could change all. Even as it is today, AI has the power to give instant feedback to all students at once. Teachers would no longer spend countless hours grading and students would get feedback in real time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068426/7443" target="_top" id="2068426">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068426" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068426/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Personalized-lessons"><a href="#Personalized-lessons" class="headerlink" title="Personalized lessons"></a>Personalized lessons</h3><p> Personalized learning works best for knowledge gaps. There are always two, three or more students who understand the entire lesson from day 1, but what about those who don’t? AI could tailor the lesson content according to a student’s specific needs and help everyone get on the same page.</p><p> One of the best things about personalized learning is that it targets specific needs and learning methods. Everyone will get to learn in their own time and style.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398455/3022" target="_top" id="398455">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398455" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398455/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Better-engagement"><a href="#Better-engagement" class="headerlink" title="Better engagement"></a>Better engagement</h3><p> Using AI in the classroom could also help teachers speak the language of their students. One thing that all youngsters have in common is an affinity for technology.</p><p> Once teachers use technology to enhance their lessons (digital textbooks, study guides, information visualization and more), students will engage more.</p><h3 id="24-7-tutoring"><a href="#24-7-tutoring" class="headerlink" title="24&#x2F;7 tutoring"></a>24&#x2F;7 tutoring</h3><p> AI can also be a great tool for supporting 24&#x2F;7 tutoring. AI-driven chatbots and virtual tutors (<a class="link"   href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4214902388537196/"  title="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4214902388537196/">Mondly VR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great example!) can be used to provide students with round-the-clock access to educational resources and support.

Do you want to study at Princeton? Are intellectually equipped to do it? Great! AI can help you do it from anywhere.</p><p> The first thing that comes to mind in this situation is exams. How can you ensure that students aren’t cheating? The answer is AI-powered remote proctoring. Look into it. It’s more clever than you’d think.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135402/19272" target="_top" id="2135402">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135402" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135402/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Say-“hola-”-to-personalized-language-learning"><a href="#Say-“hola-”-to-personalized-language-learning" class="headerlink" title="Say “hola!” to personalized language learning"></a>Say “hola!” to personalized language learning</h2><p> Now that we discussed education in general let’s move on to language learning. Having all the knowledge in the entire universe is virtually useless if you can share your thoughts with other people. Speaking more than one language can help you connect and share ideas with individuals from every corner of the world.</p><p> However, before speaking a new language, you must learn it and that’s the tricky part. People will always say you have to practice. But why increase your anxiety levels and talk to a native speaker if you’re not ready yet? Using a language learning chatbot such as <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-7409&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-7409&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-7409" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ’s, you can eliminate the effects of foreign language anxiety and refine your speaking skills without fear of embarrassment. All from the comfort of your home.</p><p> If you want to understand how AI can and will revolutionize language learning, take all the benefits mentioned above and multiply “personalized learning” by 100. There’s nothing more important than personalized training in language learning.</p><p> Some of us would <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn Japanese <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to read manga, some would need <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >English for business <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and others would like to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >speak Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with their loved ones. The bottom line is<strong>our needs differ.</strong> And when it comes to languages, AI can make all the difference.</p><p> Language learning chatbots are not perfect now, but in a few years (or maybe even months!), artificial intelligence will <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >change language learning forever <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

So, let’s learn the Korean alphabet!</p><h2 id="History-of-Hangul-–-World’s-Most-Ingenious-Alphabet"><a href="#History-of-Hangul-–-World’s-Most-Ingenious-Alphabet" class="headerlink" title="History of Hangul – World’s Most Ingenious Alphabet"></a>History of Hangul – World’s Most Ingenious Alphabet</h2><p> Usually, we don’t discuss history when it comes to writing systems, but the history of Hangul is absolutely fascinating, and you’ll surely want to find out more.</p><p> The Korean alphabet, also known as Hangul or Hangeul in South Korea and Chosŏn’gŭl in North Korea, was invented in 1443 by King Sejong the Great, the fourth king in Korea’s Joseon dynasty.</p><p> For hundreds of years, before Hangul was created, Koreans wrote using Classical Chinese characters (which they called Hanja) alongside other native phonetic writing systems. However, many lower-class people didn’t know how to read or write because of the fundamental differences between Korean and Chinese and the large number of Chinese characters. After all, even today, many people find Chinese and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Japanese <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> very difficult to learn because of their complex writing systems.</p><p> Thus, to help more common people become literate, King Sejong the Great personally created and promulgated a new alphabet: the Korean alphabet. The new writing system was designed so people with little or no education could easily learn to read and write.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hangul-sejong-600x400.jpg"                      alt="hangul sejong" title="Korean Alphabet – A Quick Guide To Hangul 8"                ></p><p> “King Sejong the Great, creator of Hangul” by Mathew Schwartz©</p><p> A document published in 1446 and discovered in 1940 explains that the design of the Korean consonants mimics their articulator’s shape and phonetic features when pronouncing them and the vowels are based on the principles of vowel harmony and yin and yang.</p><h3 id="Opposition-and-revival"><a href="#Opposition-and-revival" class="headerlink" title="Opposition and revival"></a><strong>Opposition and revival</strong></h3><p> But that’s not how the story ends.<a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul" >The new alphabet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> faced opposition from the literary elite, who believed Hanja was the only legitimate writing system and saw the circulation of the Korean alphabet as a threat to their status. Nonetheless, the Korean alphabet entered popular culture and was especially used by women and popular fiction writers.</p><p> In 1504, King Yeonsangun banned the study and publication of the Korean alphabet after documents and posters criticizing him were published.</p><p> However, the late 16th and 17th centuries saw a revival of the Korean alphabet when poetry and novels written in the Korean alphabet flourished.</p><p> Then, thanks to Korean nationalism and Western missionaries’ promotion of the Korean alphabet,<strong>Hangul</strong> (a term coined by linguist Ju Si-gyeong in 1912)<strong>was adopted in official documents for the first time in 1894.</strong></p><p> The use of Hangul met even more opposition and reforms under Japanese rule, but it eventually became the exclusive writing system in both North and South Korea after 1950.</p><h2 id="Guide-to-the-Korean-Alphabet"><a href="#Guide-to-the-Korean-Alphabet" class="headerlink" title="Guide to the Korean Alphabet"></a>Guide to the Korean Alphabet</h2><p><strong>The Korean alphabet or Hangul consists of 40 letters:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>24 basic letters</strong>  <ul><li>14 consonants (ㄱ ㄴ ㄷ ㄹ ㅁ ㅂ ㅅ ㅇ ㅈ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ)  </li><li>10 vowels (ㅏ ㅑ ㅓ ㅕ ㅗ ㅛ ㅜ ㅠ ㅡ ㅣ)</li></ul></li><li><strong>16 complex letters</strong> (formed by combining the basic letters)  <ul><li>11 complex vowels  </li><li>5 double consonants</li></ul></li></ul><p> The name “Hangeul” combines the Korean word <strong><em>han</em> (한) – meaning “great” – and_geul_ (글) – meaning “script”.</strong> However, the word_han_ is also used to refer to Korea in general, so the name can also translate to “Korean script”.</p><p> Unlike Chinese or <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Japanese <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which have hundreds or even thousands of characters – each with 10, 15, or even more strokes –<strong>the most complex Korean character has only five strokes.</strong> Besides, Hangul is a very scientific alphabet. Once you manage to understand the logic behind it, Korean writing becomes easier.</p><p> Korean characters are called_jamo_ (자모), and they are written in syllabic blocks arranged in two dimensions. One such block always has exactly one syllable. For example, to write “honeybee” in Korean (<em>kkulbeol</em>), you’ll write 꿀벌, not ㄲㅜㄹㅂㅓㄹ. Today, Korean texts are typically written from left to right, with spaces between words and Western-style punctuation.</p><p> As mentioned earlier,<strong>Hangul is a featural writing system.</strong> This means that Korean symbols mimic the shape of the mouth made when the corresponding sound is created. Absolutely fascinating!

Additionally, under each consonant, you’ll find its corresponding sound at the beginning and at the end of the syllable. Some of them have identical sounds regardless of their place in the syllable. Furthermore, some of them are silent and some of them are never used syllable-finally (like ㄸ, ㅃ, and ㅉ).</p><p> Take “ㅇ” for example, which is silent when it is at the beginning of the syllable and it is used as a placeholder when the syllable starts with a vowel.</p><p> Let’s see some other Korean consonants whose sounds transform due to location changes in a word.</p><ul><li><strong>ㅈ</strong> : 죽 [<strong>c</strong> huk] – “porridge” and 콩죽 [k’ong-<strong>j</strong> uk] – “bean porridge”;</li><li><strong>ㅂ:</strong> 밥 [<strong>p</strong> ap] – “rice” and 보리밥 [pori<strong>b</strong> ap] – “barley mixed with rice”</li><li><strong>ㄱ:</strong> 공 [<strong>k</strong> ong] – “ball” and 새 공 [sae<strong>g</strong> ong] – “new ball”</li></ul><p> It may seem a bit overwhelming now, but with some study, you’ll eventually master all these rules.

Scripts can transcribe languages at the level of morphemes (logographic scripts like Hanja), syllables (syllabaries like <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Japanese kana <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), segments (alphabetic scripts like the Latin script we use in English), or, sometimes, distinctive features. Well, imagine that the Korean alphabet incorporates aspects of the latter three.</p><p> Hangul groups sounds into syllables, uses distinct symbols for segments and sometimes uses distinct strokes to indicate distinctive features like the place of articulation (labial, coronal, velar, glottal), the manner of articulation (plosive, nasal, sibilant, aspiration) and so on.</p><p> The consonants fall into five homorganic groups – each with its own basic shape. We must not forget that the Korean symbols for consonants mimic the shape of the mouth when the corresponding sound is created. Let’s explore the basic shape of each group:</p><ul><li><strong>velar consonants</strong> (ㄱ g [k], ㅋ ḳ [kʰ]):<strong>ㄱ</strong> is a side view of the back of the tongue raised toward the velum;<strong>ㅋ</strong> is derived from<strong>ㄱ</strong> with an extra stroke for the burst of aspiration.</li><li><strong>sibilant consonants</strong> (ㅅ s [s], ㅈ j [tɕ], ㅊ ch [tɕʰ]):<strong>ㅅ</strong> represents a side view of the teeth and the horizontal line at the top of<strong>ㅈ</strong> represents the firm contact with the roof of your mouth; the horizontal stroke topping<strong>ㅊ</strong> represents an additional burst of aspiration.</li><li><strong>coronal consonants</strong> (ㄴ <em>n</em>  [n] ,ㄷ <em>d</em>  [t] ,ㅌ ṭ [tʰ] ,ㄹ <em>r</em>  [ɾ, l]): <strong>ㄴ</strong> is a side view of the tip of the tongue raised toward the gum ridge; the horizontal line at the top of<strong>ㄷ</strong> represents steady contact with the roof of the mouth; the middle stroke on<strong>ㅌ</strong> represents a burst of aspiration and the top of ㄹ represents a flap of the tongue.</li><li><strong>bilabial consonants</strong> (ㅁ <em>m</em>  [m] ,ㅂ <em>b</em>  [p] ,ㅍ <em>p̣</em>  [pʰ]) –<strong>ㅁ</strong> represents the shape of the lips brought together; the top of<strong>ㅂ</strong> represents the release burst of the b, the top horizontal stroke of<strong>ㅍ</strong> is for the burst of aspiration.</li><li><strong>dorsal consonants</strong> (ㅇ ‘&#x2F;<em>ng</em>  [ʔ, ŋ] ,ㅎ <em>h</em>  [h]) –<strong>ㅇ</strong> is an outline of the throat and <strong>ㅎ</strong> is pronounced in the throat with a close represented by the top horizontal line.

Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>if the vowel consists of a long vertical line like<strong>ㅏ, ㅑ, ㅓ, ㅕ,</strong> or<strong>ㅣ</strong> , the consonant accompanying it will take the first (or the left) half of the block and the vowel will be written in the second half:<strong>ㅂ + ㅣ &#x3D; 비</strong> (bi) or<strong>ㅇ + ㅏ &#x3D; 아</strong> (a);</li><li>if the vowel consists of a long horizontal line like<strong>ㅗ, ㅛ, ㅜ, ㅠ,</strong> or<strong>ㅡ,</strong> the consonant accompanying it will be written on the upper half of the block and the vowel in the lower half:<strong>ㅋ + ㅠ &#x3D; 큐</strong> (kyu) or<strong>ㅇ + ㅗ &#x3D; 오</strong> (o);</li><li>if you have a consonant and a vowel and then another final consonant attached at the end, the second consonant letter will be written at the very bottom of the block shape and will be called<strong>받침</strong> <em>batchim</em> (“supporting floor”):<strong>부 + ㄹ &#x3D; 불</strong> (bul) or<strong>아 + ㄴ &#x3D; 안</strong> (an);</li><li>if the vowel combines orientations (has both a long vertical line and a long horizontal line like<strong>ㅢ</strong>), then it will wrap around the initial character from the bottom to the right:<strong>ㅇ+ ㅢ &#x3D; 의</strong> (ui).</li></ul><p>Before you go, make sure you check out these frequently asked questions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105863/7443" target="_top" id="2105863">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105863" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105863/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-long-does-it-take-to-learn-Hangul"><a href="#How-long-does-it-take-to-learn-Hangul" class="headerlink" title="How long does it take to learn Hangul?"></a>How long does it take to learn Hangul?</h3><p> Hangul can be learned in as little as a couple of hours.

Within a week of its official launch, Mondly VR became the Top Selling Educational App in the store, currently ranking as the #1 solution in VR Education.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Mondly VR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  uses Quest’s microphone to allow you to speak and then evaluates your delivery with the help of speech recognition. In addition to offering a memorable learning experience, <strong>Mondly VR also eliminates the effects of foreign language anxiety</strong>  and helps users refine their speaking skills without fear of embarrassment. Learners can practice real-life scenarios such as making a hotel reservation, taking a taxi, or ordering dinner.</p><p> After going through Oculus’ rigorous selection process, Mondly VR received major improvements to ensure the highest possible quality for Quest users. Featuring dynamic conversations, feedback on pronunciation, and intelligent suggestions, the app aims at being the closest experience to actual immersion.</p><p> With Mondly VR, users can practice 29 languages: English, Spanish, German, French, Italian, and more.</p><h2 id="VR-is-ready-to-disrupt-education"><a href="#VR-is-ready-to-disrupt-education" class="headerlink" title="VR is ready to disrupt education"></a><strong>VR is ready to disrupt education</strong></h2><p> The VR industry has historically been dedicated to gaming experiences, however, <strong>with Oculus Quest, educational apps are ready to steal the spotlight</strong>  and become part of global learning and development initiatives in organizations worldwide. <a class="link"   href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/emerging-tech/virtual-reality-study.html" >PwC recently conducted a study <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  showcasing the spectacular benefits of workplace training in VR. The research followed the outcomes of a soft skills training in a US-based organization, involving three learning modalities: classroom, e-learning, and VR. The outcomes were staggering, VR learners being up to <strong>4 times faster to train</strong> than in the classroom setting, and <strong>275% more confident</strong>  to apply the learned skills at their workplace. In addition to this, the VR learners were <strong>3.75 times more emotionally connected</strong> to the content and <strong>4 times more focused</strong> than their peers.</p><p> To better understand how the human brain responds to VR,  the University of Maryland’s College of Computer, Mathematical and Natural Sciences conducted a study  revealing that VR is more effective in acquiring skills due to its ability to enhance the neural connections needed for learning. As a result of the lifelike environments that learners experience, language immersion and simulations are easily accessible to everyone, changing the whole dynamic of education and enabling students to gain practical experience in numerous fields without the burden of logistics.</p><p> The first VR experience Mondly launched in 2017 has 100,000 users to date and is the most referenced VR language learning app in the academic space. 100+ research articles highlight its impact in advancing language learning.   <strong>VR creates a perfect environment for acquiring new skills at a 4 times faster rate compared to traditional learning methods.</strong></p><p> “Our continuous involvement in VR development and science-backed learning methodologies enables us to pioneer solutions for personal development, workforce training, and K-12 education, changing the way language learning is perceived across the world. We always promoted VR as the most effective way to learn and we hope to inspire more developers to enhance 21st-century learning.  Mondly’s mission is to advance the way people learn languages through cutting-edge technologies. This is why we brought Mondly VR to Quest,” said Alexandru Iliescu, CEO and Co-Founder at Mondly.   <strong>“VR is no longer just a form of entertainment, but a powerful tool for acquiring skills.</strong>  Our goal for this decade is to push the boundaries of VR language learning and open new horizons for personal improvement and workforce training.”</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/mondly-vr-oculus-quest/&t=Mondly+Launched+the+First-Ever+Language+App+on+Oculus+Quest"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016134/19272" target="_top" id="2016134">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016134" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016134/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="About-Mondly"><a href="#About-Mondly" class="headerlink" title="About Mondly"></a><strong>About Mondly</strong></h2><p> Being named “App of the Year” by Facebook, “Best New App” by Apple, and “Editors’ Choice” by Google Play, Mondly is a leading language learning platform with 80 million learners worldwide.

To make sure you are using your newly acquired French days of the week correctly, don’t forget that:</p><ul><li><p><strong>the days of the week are not capitalized in French</strong> – unless, of course, they appear at the beginning of a sentence;</p></li><li><p><strong>the French week starts on Monday;</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>days of the week are all masculine in French</strong> – this means you’ll always have to use masculine articles <em>(le</em> and <em>un)</em>  and masculine adjectives when talking about the days of the week. For example, if you want to say “the last Friday of the month was rainy” in French, you say <em>“le dernier vendredi du mois était pluvieux”;</em></p></li><li><p>in contrast to <em>le jour</em> , <a href="https://french.kwiziq.com/revision/grammar/when-to-use-an-annee-matin-matinee-jour-journee-soir-soiree-time-unit-vs-duration"><em>la journée</em></a> (which also translates to “day”) is a feminine noun that refers to a longer period of time during which something might happen. <em>Jour,</em> on the other hand, represents a precise moment, a unit of time. For example: “<em>Je te rendrai visite dans la journée”</em> (“I’ll visit you during the day”) is different from <em>“Je t’appelle dans deux jours”</em> (“I’ll call you in two days”).</p></li><li><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/days-of-the-week-in-french/&t=The+Days+of+the+Week+in+French"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></li><li><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></li></ul><hr><h4 id="From-0-to-conversational-in-French"><a href="#From-0-to-conversational-in-French" class="headerlink" title="From 0 to conversational in French"></a>From 0 to conversational in French</h4><p> Do you want to see the<strong>French weekdays</strong> in action?
