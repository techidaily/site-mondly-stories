So what are you waiting for? <strong>C_arpe diem_ (“seize the day”)</strong> and start mastering the Latin language right now!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/latin-courses-277x600.jpg"                      alt="latin courses" title="This Is The Easiest Way To Learn Latin Online 2"                ></p><p> Learn Latin with Mondly</p><p> If you are wondering why Latin, a dead language, was added to Mondly’s language portfolio and – most importantly – what are the reasons to learn Latin, continue reading the following paragraphs and your questions shall be answered.<em>Mihi crede‌</em> (“trust me”).</p><h2 id="The-Latin-language-the-core-of-Romance-languages"><a href="#The-Latin-language-the-core-of-Romance-languages" class="headerlink" title="The Latin language, the core of Romance languages"></a>The Latin language, the core of Romance languages</h2><p> Originally spoken in Rome, the Latin language has then spread together with the increase of the Roman empire and later developed into the Romance languages we all know today: Italian, French, Portuguese, Romanian, Catalan and Spanish.</p><p> Over time, the Latin language has known a number of historical phases distinguished by subtle differences in vocabulary, usage, spelling, morphology, and syntax. These are known as Old Latin, Classical Latin, Vulgar Latin (that also influenced the Romance languages), Medieval Latin, Renaissance Latin, New Latin and Contemporary Latin or the Latin we use today in the Catholic Church, in science, mottos, et cetera (“and so forth”).</p><p> Additionally,<strong>Latin has also highly influenced English</strong> through ecclesiastical usage and writers who borrowed words that we still use today.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/latin-language-600x450.jpg"                      alt="latin language" title="This Is The Easiest Way To Learn Latin Online 3"                ></p><p> “Hercules furens” by Seneca.</p><p><em>Ergo</em> , history makes Latin the backbone of many present-day languages and studying it could help you gain valuable insight into the infrastructure of many other languages.</p><h2 id="Latin-grammar-and-the-Latin-alphabet"><a href="#Latin-grammar-and-the-Latin-alphabet" class="headerlink" title="Latin grammar and the Latin alphabet"></a>Latin grammar and the Latin alphabet</h2><p> The Latin alphabet that many languages use today evolved from the visually similar Etruscan alphabet, which – in turn – evolved from the Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician alphabet that derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. As a result of Etruscans ruling early Rome, over time, their alphabet developed into the Latin alphabet that many centuries later became the writing system we all know today.</p><p>A fascinating origin story, isn’t it?</p><p> With three distinct genders, up to seven noun cases, five declensions, four verb conjugations, six tenses, three persons, three moods, two voices, two or three aspects and two numbers, Latin grammar may seem complicated. But once you start your Latin classes with Mondly and learn to read Latin, you’ll be surprised how fast you can actually master this language due to the knowledge you already possess.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633281&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/2_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Monthly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Common-Latin-phrases-and-expressions-we-still-use-today"><a href="#Common-Latin-phrases-and-expressions-we-still-use-today" class="headerlink" title="Common Latin phrases and expressions we still use today"></a>Common Latin phrases and expressions we still use today</h2><p> <strong>Far from being a dead language, Latin is very much alive in our day-to-day conversations.</strong> <em>Carpe diem</em> ,<em>et cetera</em> ,<em>et alii</em> ,<em>habemus papam</em> ,<em>in vitro</em> ,<em>magna cum laude</em> ,<em>curriculum vitae</em> and_mea culpa_ are just a few of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Latin phrases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> we still use today.</p><p> Although Latin may be a “dead” language, it is not considered extinct because it is still in use in other ways.

Ergo, learning Latin will help you master the overall structure and vocabulary of other languages as well.</p></li><li><p>Latin can prepare you for many professions or simply discussions with scholarly people. These fields include law, medicine, science, music, theology, philosophy, art, and literature.</p></li><li><p>Knowing Latin could help you enjoy some of the most influential literature in the world in their original language. Just imagine being able to read “The Aeneid” by Virgil, “Metamorphoses” by Ovid, “Selected Works” by Cicero or “The Conquest of Gaul” by Julius Caesar in Latin!</p></li><li><p>Many scholars believe that learning Latin also sharpens the mind, cultivating careful analysis and attention.</p></li><li><p>Additionally, deciphering the “secret code” of Latin, discovering the meanings behind words you already know from other languages and reading great authors in their original language is a pleasure that will last you a lifetime.</p></li><li><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/easiest-way-to-learn-latin-online/&t=This+Is+the+Easiest+Way+to+Learn+Latin+Online"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></li><li><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="1080" height="1620" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:1080px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Start learning Latin today<p> The Latin language is no longer is secret code meant only for scholars or the Catholic Church.

Scope</strong></p><p> 1.1. The following terms and conditions (“<strong>Terms of Use</strong> “) apply between<strong>ATI STUDIOS A.P.P.S. S.R.L</strong> , with its registered office at 50A Griviței Avenue Building 15, Entrance C, 1st Floor, Apt. 1 Brașov County, Brasov, Romania (“<strong>Mondly</strong> “) and you as a user of the Mondly App with its free basic functions as well as additional paid functions selected by you by way of so-called InApp Purchases (“<strong>Order(s)”)</strong> (collectively<strong>“App”</strong>).</p><p> 1.2. The App can only be used by consumers, i.e. persons who are not acting for predominantly commercial or self-employed purposes (“<strong>users</strong> “,<strong>“you”</strong>).</p><p> 1.3. References in these Terms of Use to the applicability of statutory provisions are for clarification purposes only. As such, the statutory provisions will still apply even if not set out in these Terms of Use, unless these are supplemented or expressly excluded.</p><p><strong>2. Subject matter of performance and conclusion of contract</strong></p><p> 2.1. The Mondly App provides a language learning solution according to the available features that allow users to learn many different languages. Mondly App shall act as a tool to support users to improve language skills but does not promise that the user will reach a specific progress in learning a language.</p><p> 2.2. The user can access the App via the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store and download it to his or her device in accordance with these terms of use here, which are displayed in each case as part of the contract initiation process and must be accepted by the user before starting the download process. By clicking on the download button, the user makes an offer to conclude a contract for the use of the App, including its free basic functions, which Mondly accepts by making the App available for use on the user’s device.</p><p> 2.3. If the user wishes to expand the basic functions of the App with additional functions for which a fee is charged (“premium features”), the user must place an order in the App. Offers by Mondly for paid content are not binding. Orders placed by the user constitute a binding offer to conclude a contract for the respective premium features. By clicking on the button “Order with obligation to pay”, the user makes a binding offer to conclude a contract for the respective premium features. The user’s offer only becomes binding for both parties when Mondly actually provides the premium feature in the App.</p><p> 2.4. The user can use the App and all of its functions, regardless of whether they are paid or free of charge, without having to create a user account in the App. A user account only needs to be created if the user wishes to save their learning progress in the App.</p><p> 2.5. For a limited period of time specified in the app, Mondly may, at its own discretion, make individual additional premium features available to the user free of charge for test purposes.</p><p> 2.6. We will send you the contract, which contains the details of your order, as well as these Terms of Use in text form. For security reasons, the contract text is no longer accessible online after the contract has been concluded. Furthermore, you can access these terms of use in the App in the settings under “Info”.</p><p><strong>3. Prices and terms of payment</strong></p><p> 3.1. The user can use the App with the basic functions specified in the service description free of charge.</p><p> 3.2. For the use of the premium features of the App that go beyond the basic functions of the App, the user must pay the fees shown during the order process.</p><p> 3.3. Depending on the operating system of the user’s device, payment is made via the Apple App Store or Google Play Store account using the means of payment available there. The terms and conditions of the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store will apply in relation to this payment.</p><p> 3.4. An internet connection is required to download the app, which must be provided at the user’s own expense.</p><p><strong>4. Rights of use</strong></p><ul><li>During the term of the respective contract, Mondly grants the user the non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to use the App, including its free basic functions and any premium features, on a single mobile end device, limited to the term of the contract, exclusively for private purposes in accordance with these Terms of Use, i.e. to install it on the respective device, to copy it to the extent technically necessary for use in accordance with the contract, to load it, to display it and to run it.</li><li>Neither the App nor its respective free basic and premium features may be shared with or made available to third parties without Mondly’s prior written consent. In particular, the user may not grant third parties access to the App and its service components, and in particular may not disclose its access data to third parties. If the user creates a user account, the user must protect his user password from access by third parties and keep it secret. The user may not pass on his password to unauthorised third parties.</li></ul><p> 4.3. In particular, the user is prohibited from (i) sublicensing, selling, reselling, transferring, assigning, distributing, sharing, leasing, renting or otherwise generating revenue from the Mondly Services, (ii) reverse engineering, disassembling, deciphering, translating, decompiling or creating derivative versions of the Mondly Software, except as required by law, (iii) enter or generate any data or other content in the App that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, invasive of another’s privacy or publicity rights, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable.</p><p> 4.4. For the term of the respective contract, the user grants Mondly the non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable right to use content entered by the user in the App, in particular to reproduce, store and process it in the App on the user’s mobile device to the extent that this is necessary for the use of the App, including its respective free basic and premium features, for the benefit of the user in accordance with these Terms of Use and the Description of Services.</p><p><strong>5. Term and termination</strong></p><p> 5.1. The use of the App, including its free basic functions, is not subject to a fixed term. Mondly or the user are entitled to terminate the App at any time with immediate effect. Mondly can terminate by deactivating a corresponding free basic function in the App or the App as a whole. The user may terminate the App including its free components by uninstalling the App from their mobile device. Mondly’s must not terminate the App including its free basic functions to the extent that the user has subscribed to premium features which require the use of the free App and&#x2F;or its free basic features as a precondition.</p><p> 5.2. For premium features, depending on the respective additional function, an initial term of 30 calendar days or 12 months applies from the day of activation of the premium feature in the app. The term of the premium feature is indicated in the App its respective description in the app and can be viewed transparently in the app on an ongoing basis. After expiry of the initial term, this is automatically extended for another same period, whereby the user is entitled to terminate the contractual relationship extended in this way at any time with a notice period of one month. Users can terminate by deselecting the respective premium feature in the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store.</p><p> 5.3. The right of either party to terminate the respective contract for good cause shall remain unaffected. Good cause shall be deemed to exist if the terminating party, taking into account the respective circumstances of the individual case and weighing the interests of both parties, can no longer reasonably be expected to continue the contractual relationship until the agreed termination or until the expiry of a notice period. If the good cause consists in the breach of an obligation under the contract, termination is only permissible after the unsuccessful expiry of a period set for remedy or after an unsuccessful warning. Section 323 (2) numbers 1 and 2 German Civil Code shall apply mutatis mutandis to the dispensability of setting a time limit for remedial action and to the dispensability of a warning. The determination of a time limit for remedial action and a warning are also dispensable if there are special circumstances which justify immediate termination after weighing the interests of both parties.</p><p> 5.4. In the event of termination, for whatever reason, all rights of use granted to the user in respect of the terminated contractual service shall come to an end. I.e. in the event of termination of a particular premium feature, the user’s rights of use to this terminated premium feature will come to an end, but the user’s rights to use other premium features or the App and its free basic functions will continue (unless these have also been terminated). If the user terminates due to a breach of a contractual obligation by Mondly and&#x2F;or for good cause and if the Customer has paid usage fees in advance, Mondly will refund the Customer the usage fees paid in advance on a proportionate basis for the period from the date on which the termination takes effect.</p><p><strong>6. Warranty</strong></p><p> 6.1. If the App, including its free basic functions and any premium features selected by the user, contains a defect at the time of provision which renders the App, a free basic function and&#x2F;or a premium feature unsuitable for use in accordance with the contract, or if such a defect arises during the term of the contract, the user will not be charged for the period during which the App was not suitable.</p><p> 6.2. In cases in which the suitability of the app, a free basic function and&#x2F;or a premium feature for use in accordance with the contract is not unavailable but merely reduced, the user shall only pay a reduced usage fee. An non-material defect or interruption shall not give rise to a reduced fee.</p><p> 6.3. Claims for damages by the user shall be subject to the limitations of liability set out in the following clause 7.</p><p><strong>7. Liability</strong></p><p> 7.1. In the event of culpable injury to life, limb or health, the existence of a guarantee, fraudulent intent or in cases of liability under the Product Liability Act, Mondly shall be liable in accordance with the statutory provisions.</p><p> 7.2. Also in accordance with the statutory provisions, Mondly is liable for damage caused by intent or gross negligence, including intent or gross negligence on the part of Mondly’s representatives or vicarious agents.</p><p> 7.3. In the event of a slightly negligent breach of a material contractual obligation, the fulfilment of which is a prerequisite for the proper implementation of the contractual agreement, the breach of which jeopardises the achievement of the contractual purpose and the observance of which the user can regularly rely on, Mondly shall be liable in accordance with the statutory provisions, but limited to compensation for the typically foreseeable damage.</p><p> 7.4. In all other respects, liability on the part of Mondly is excluded, irrespective of the legal grounds. This applies in particular to liability under Section 536a Paragraph 1 Sentence 1, 1st Alt. German Civil Code.</p><p> 7.5. The above provisions also apply in favour of Mondly’s vicarious agents.</p><p><strong>8. Property and commercial property rights</strong></p><p> Mondly is and remains the owner of all property rights and industrial property rights, in particular copyright and exploitation rights, database rights, patents, trade secrets, trademarks and all other intellectual property rights and similar rights, including technical solutions, in and relating to the App and its performance components, in particular the language content and learning methods.</p><p><strong>9. Other</strong></p><p> 9.1. The App and its service components may contain links to certain third-party products, services or software.

Do you know how they say brides need something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue? Well, English had all of that except the blue. Anglo-Saxon words were old,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Shakespeare’s words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> were new and all the loanwords from other languages were borrowed. If you can’t put your finger on the <strong>English words borrowed from other languages, think_café, ballet, fiancé, spaghetti, espresso, pretzel._</strong>  You got the point.</p><p> Of course, this story is far from true, but that doesn’t mean it won’t help you remember how the modern English vocabulary came to be. Unexpected connections are a good strategy for remembering new things. Anyway, enough storytelling for now. Let’s see what common words English “took” from other languages.</p><h2 id="Where-did-English-Come-From"><a href="#Where-did-English-Come-From" class="headerlink" title="Where did English Come From?"></a>Where did English Come From?</h2><p> The earliest forms of English, collectively known as Old English or Anglo-Saxon, developed from the North Sea Germanic languages that came to Britain between the mid-5th and 7th centuries AD. This linguistic influence made its way to Britain through the migration of the Anglo-Saxons from what is now northwest Germany, southern Denmark, and the Netherlands.</p><p> Not long after that, in the 8th and 9th centuries, Old English began to borrow foreign words from the Old-<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Norse-speaking Viking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> invaders and settlers. Subsequently, in the late 11th century, Middle English emerged, marked by a new influx of borrowed words from Old French following the Norman Conquest of England.</p><p> Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the Renaissance trend of borrowing Latin and Greek words and roots, which also coincided with the Great Vowel Shift. The era culminated in the King James Bible and the works of William Shakespeare.</p><p> While the question may sound funny (“where did English come from?”), it is a popular inquiry among Google users for obvious reasons. After all, 1.3 billion people worldwide speak English either natively or as a second language. It’s only natural for them to be curious about the origin of the English language.</p><h2 id="English-Words-from-Foreign-Languages"><a href="#English-Words-from-Foreign-Languages" class="headerlink" title="English Words from Foreign Languages"></a>English Words from Foreign Languages</h2><ol><li>Guru (Sanskrit)</li><li>Tsunami (Japanese)</li><li>Versatile (Latin)</li><li>Vodka (Russian)</li><li>Chocolate (Nahuatl, an Aztec language)</li><li>Algebra (Arabic)</li><li>Banana (Wolof, a language spoken in Senegal)</li><li>Robot (Czech)</li><li>Tycoon (Japanese)</li><li>Yoga (Sanskrit)</li><li>Shampoo (Hindi)</li><li>Taco (Nahuatl)</li><li>Safari (Arabic)</li><li>Kangaroo (Guugu Yimithirr, an Australian Aboriginal language)</li><li>Czar (Russian)</li><li>Jungle (Hindi)</li><li>Boomerang (Dharuk, an Australian Aboriginal language)</li><li>Sushi (Japanese)</li><li>Pajamas (Hindi)</li><li>Loot (Sanskrit)</li><li>Mosquito (Latin)</li><li>Karaoke (Japanese)</li><li>Lemon (Arabic)</li><li>Penguin (Welsh)</li><li>Ninja (Japanese)</li><li>Ketchup (Chinese)</li><li>Algebra (Arabic)</li><li>Metropolis (Greek)</li><li>Avatar (Sanskrit)</li><li>Nemesis (Greek)</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/english-foreign-words-600x600.png"                      alt="English foreign words" title="100+ English Words Borrowed From Other Languages 4"                ></p><p> Although we usually call them “borrowed words”, these are also known as loanwords. According to Oxford Languages,<strong>a loanword</strong> is_“a word adopted from a foreign language with little or no modification”_ . The transition from one language to another can happen through:</p><ul><li><strong>Transcription,</strong> which means borrowing words while preserving their original pronunciation in the borrowed language;</li><li><strong>Transliteration,</strong> which involves adapting the written form of the loanword in accordance with the alphabet of the borrowing language;</li><li><strong>Loan translation,</strong> also known as calque, which involves borrowing words, phrases, or expressions by translating their literal meanings into the borrowing language.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/themes/mondly/img/mondly-banner-icon.png"                      alt="mondly banner icon" title="100+ English Words Borrowed From Other Languages 5"                ></p><h5 id="Improve-your-English-fast-🚀"><a href="#Improve-your-English-fast-🚀" class="headerlink" title="Improve your English fast 🚀"></a>Improve your English fast 🚀</h5><p> With Mondly, English mastery is at your fingertips – and in your native tongue.

Considering that French was the language of the English king and his court for over 300 years, it’s no surprise. During that time, as many as 10,000 French loanwords came into English.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713324&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVTV1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV TV Webcaster</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Spanish-loanwords-English-words-that-are-actually-Spanish"><a href="#Spanish-loanwords-English-words-that-are-actually-Spanish" class="headerlink" title="Spanish loanwords: English words that are actually Spanish"></a>Spanish loanwords: English words that are actually Spanish</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Chinchilla</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Rodeo</td></tr><tr><td>Patio</td></tr><tr><td>Plaza</td></tr><tr><td>Embargo</td></tr><tr><td>Ranch</td></tr><tr><td>Aficionado</td></tr><tr><td>Tornado</td></tr><tr><td>Canyon</td></tr><tr><td>Salsa</td></tr><tr><td>Piñata</td></tr><tr><td>Lasso</td></tr><tr><td>Guerilla</td></tr><tr><td>Stampede</td></tr><tr><td>Oregano</td></tr><tr><td>Guacamole</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Unlike French loanwords which have been adapted into British English, most of the<strong>Spanish loanwords entered English via the North American English route.</strong> Cultural exchanges between <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Spanish-speaking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and English-speaking communities led to an influx of loanwords related to food and music in particular.

Many sources agree that<strong>the English language consists of roughly 470,000 words.</strong> However, most linguists advise to take that with a pinch of salt. While some words have become obsolete, new additions are always making their way into the English vocabulary, so it’s difficult to put our finger on an exact number. Then, there’s also the question of different variations of a single word like “go”, “went”, “gone”. Do we count that as a single word or as three separate ones?</p><p> One thing is certain: the English vocabulary is still expanding. As you know, English does not only borrow words from other languages, but it also constantly coins new words to reflect advances in technology.</p><p>Loading poll …</p><p>Coming Soon</p><p> Do you believe the claim that ~80% of the English vocabulary is borrowed from other languages?</p><p> Yes, English is a linguistic melting pot.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Grammatical-Structure-Vs-Communicative-Skills"><a href="#Grammatical-Structure-Vs-Communicative-Skills" class="headerlink" title="Grammatical Structure Vs. Communicative Skills"></a>Grammatical Structure Vs. Communicative Skills</h2><p>Language learning is one of the best ways to broaden your horizons and better yourself as a person. It can also be intimidating. Many people would like to learn a foreign language, but they feel the task would be too hard. This is unfortunate because with a little effort and a commitment to the goal, learning a language can happen sooner than most people think.</p><h2 id="The-Old-Methods-Do-They-Make-It-More-Difficult-to-Learn-a-Foreign-Language"><a href="#The-Old-Methods-Do-They-Make-It-More-Difficult-to-Learn-a-Foreign-Language" class="headerlink" title="**The Old Methods: Do They Make It More Difficult to Learn a Foreign Language"></a>**The Old Methods: Do They Make It More Difficult to Learn a Foreign Language</h2><p>Chances are that you probably took language classes at some point in your educational history. Anywhere you live, school curriculums include the study of foreign languages, but the average high-school student does not graduate with fluency in another language.</p><p>Many students can manage reading and writing in a foreign language, but they struggle to understand it in conversational form. These situations make it clear that the past methods of language education are lacking. What is the solution?</p><h2 id="Language-Learning-What-Holds-People-Back"><a href="#Language-Learning-What-Holds-People-Back" class="headerlink" title="Language Learning: What Holds People Back?"></a><strong>Language Learning: What Holds People Back?</strong></h2><p>One of the best ways to learn a language is to practice both writing the language and speaking it in a conversational manner. This is where many people panic and lose confidence in everything they have learned. If you’re new at a language, chances are that you haven’t even begun to grasp all the important grammar rules. This can lead to insecurity about sounding stupid when you write or speak the language, and this fear might hold you back from practicing.</p><p>This is why a focus on grammar is the wrong way to teach and learn a language. Grammar is the art of perfecting the use of a language you already know. When learning a language, it can hold students back in a variety of ways.</p><h3 id="1-Complexity"><a href="#1-Complexity" class="headerlink" title="1. Complexity"></a><strong>1. Complexity</strong></h3><p>There is a lot to take in when learning a language. The last thing a student needs is to get bogged down in a sea of confusing grammar rules. Of course, there are languages with simpler rules. For example, the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >French grammar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is more difficult than <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >the German grammar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but unless you’re naturally gifted at learning languages, realizing there are so many grammar rules to figure out might leave you so discouraged that you give up.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1821134/17882" target="_top" id="1821134"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1821134"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1821134/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Incorrect-Focus"><a href="#2-Incorrect-Focus" class="headerlink" title="2. Incorrect Focus"></a><strong>2. Incorrect Focus</strong></h3><p>Grammar rules are generally about perfecting the written language. This isn’t to say that having a strong grasp on the written aspects of the language are not important. After all, many people do the majority of their communication online these days. However, if your aim is to learn to speak a foreign language, then spending a large amount of time focusing on grammar might be holding you back.</p><p>The goal for a language student is to become fluent as quickly as possible. Fluency with the spoken word will transfer to an understanding of the written word as well. The old models of teaching do not place importance on becoming fluent as quickly as possible, and it seems this is a huge part of the problem.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068416/7443" target="_top" id="2068416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068416"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068416/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-A-Lack-of-Conversational-Aspects"><a href="#3-A-Lack-of-Conversational-Aspects" class="headerlink" title="3. A Lack of Conversational Aspects"></a><strong>3. A Lack of Conversational Aspects</strong></h3><p>Most of us don’t speak in the exact same way that we write. We choose different words, use slang and sometimes even say things in a different order than we would when writing them down. How many people do you know who speak using perfect grammar? Sure, some might exist, but it isn’t very common regardless what language we are discussing. For this reason, if you insist on studying grammar first and conversational language second, you might struggle to understand people as they speak. Luckily, nowadays, there are <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >modern solutions available that immerse you in conversations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from day 1.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-A-Major-Lack-of-Fun"><a href="#4-A-Major-Lack-of-Fun" class="headerlink" title="4.

Too much focus on perfecting grammar can suck all the joy out of learning. Instead, students should make language learning about having pleasant conversations and social interactions.

You learned by listening to the people around you speak. Since all children learn languages by focusing on the spoken word, shouldn’t adults do the same? Why are our schools placing such importance on perfect grammar?</p><p>It makes much more sense to first develop fluency in speaking the language. Once a student is comfortable, more focus can be placed on perfecting grammar. It’s difficult to perfect upon a language you don’t yet understand.</p><p>If worrying about grammar has been holding you back in language learning, allow yourself to forget about that aspect for now. Instead, focus on having fun and staying positive as you learn. Keeping a healthy attitude and enjoying the process is the best way to set yourself up for success, and if you keep at it, you’ll be having conversations in your chosen language before you know it.</p><p>Do you feel that grammar holds you back from learning a language?

No matter the circumstances, friendly or professional, you can’t go wrong with a proper enthusiastic greeting.</p><p> Swedish people are sociable, and they care about traditions, so any foreigner should know how to, at least, properly introduce themselves and start a conversation. Learn more about all the Swedish greetings, and maybe you’ll feel inspired to try something new and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >start learning the Nordic language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Here’s some to start with:</p><h2 id="What-you-should-know"><a href="#What-you-should-know" class="headerlink" title="What you should know"></a>What you should know</h2><p> Swedes are respectful, but they rarely use last names or Mr. and Mrs in rather formal conversations as well. They like to call themselves by their first name, even in some professional circles. Equality and the lack of hierarchies in the workplace is a specific trait of the Swedish society. If you want to move to Sweden or visit the country, you must get accustomed to all these little details. This will make it easier for you to become “one of them” and meet new people</p><p> If you’re visiting and want to get a coffee, the simplest way to sound and look like a local is to throw in a smile and a <strong>“Hej!”</strong> (pronounced just like <em>Hey!</em>). This one is the perfect greeting, regardless of the time of day or to whom you address it.</p><h2 id="How-to-say-“Hello-”-in-Swedish"><a href="#How-to-say-“Hello-”-in-Swedish" class="headerlink" title="How to say “Hello!” in Swedish"></a>How to say “Hello!” in Swedish</h2><p> In more formal circumstances, you can use the word <strong>“hallå”</strong> (&#x2F;haˈloː&#x2F;). Sometimes, Swedes like to articulate the word when greeting someone by saying <strong>“</strong> <strong>Hallå, hallå!”</strong>  or even use it when they’re irritated and what to bring more attention to a situation they’re telling you about.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1611407/17882" target="_top" id="1611407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1611407"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="485"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1611407/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-answer-the-phone-in-Swedish"><a href="#How-to-answer-the-phone-in-Swedish" class="headerlink" title="How to answer the phone in Swedish"></a>How to answer the phone in Swedish</h2><p> Even if you’re just visiting, you might have to answer the phone at the hotel or when you’re expecting a call from the embassy, for example. The easiest way to do this is to say “Hello” followed by introducing yourself. This sounds something like : <strong>“</strong> <strong>Hallå! Det här är [your name].”</strong>  This will not only impress the person on the other end, but they might mistake you for a local. That would be a good thing, but you need to let them know you don’t speak Swedish fluently before they start talking faster.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BOST%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/ost-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-say-“Good-Morning-”-in-Swedish"><a href="#How-to-say-“Good-Morning-”-in-Swedish" class="headerlink" title="How to say “Good Morning!” in Swedish"></a>How to say “Good Morning!” in Swedish</h2><p> At the restaurant, cafés, or when you enter a building, saying “Good Morning!” is a sign of respect and will help you establish a connection with those around you. The Swedish equivalent of the morning greeting is <strong>“God morgon!”</strong>  . It’s important to use all the common greetings, even as a foreigner because you will most likely make a good impression.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4596923&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_468X60.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-say-“Good-evening-”-in-Swedish"><a href="#How-to-say-“Good-evening-”-in-Swedish" class="headerlink" title="How to say “Good evening!” in Swedish"></a>How to say “Good evening!” in Swedish</h2><p><strong>“God kväll!”</strong> is a rather formal greeting in <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Swedish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  , but you might hear this in theaters, or when the evening news show starts.

When saying goodbye to friends, Swedes also use <strong>“Vi ses!”</strong> – see you! or <strong>“Vi hörs!”</strong> – talk soon.</p><p> Greetings can help you connect with people around the world, and learning the Swedish basics will help you get a nice introduction to this beautiful language.

A mere gesture of using the local Russian language can elevate a simple interaction to a heartfelt connection. Even without mastering the entire language, familiarizing yourself with basic Russian phrases such as “hello”, “good morning”, “please”, “thank you”, or simply “yes” can create welcoming moments and forge bonds.</p><p> In this guide, we will delve into both common and unique Russian greetings. So if you’ve ever wondered how to<strong>greet in Russian</strong> and witness its transformative power, you’re in the right place.

Being slightly formal, yet friendly makes it perfect for greeting people in a professional setting or people you don’t know. Besides, you can also use it to address a group of people as the verb form is meant for formal settings or addressing multiple people.</p><p> Rooted in the phrase “to be healthy and well”, it’s not just a greeting, but a wish for good health.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                >vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Привет-Privyet-Hi-in-Russian"><a href="#Привет-Privyet-Hi-in-Russian" class="headerlink" title="Привет (Privyet): Hi in Russian"></a>Привет (Privyet): Hi in Russian</h3><p><strong>Привет</strong> is the most popular informal Russian greeting.

Additional Russian greetings Russians use"></a>3. Additional Russian greetings Russians use</h2><p> Now onto less popular greetings. Or let’s call them “specialized”. Sounds better, right? These are the kind of “bonus” Russian greetings you use once you feel more comfortable with the language. Because – let’s be honest: not all words are equally important. You have to focus on the most frequently used ones first.</p><ul><li><strong>Здравствуй (Zdrastvui):</strong> This is an informal variation of Здравствуйте (Zdravstvuyte) (which was the first Russian greeting we presented in this article). It’s best if you use it to address only one person at a time.</li><li><strong>здрасьте (Zdras’te):</strong> Another colloquial and shorter version for Здравствуйте (Zdravstvuyte). It’s what you’d use if you want to sound friendly in an interaction with someone of the same age who you don’t know – the cashier at the store for instance.</li><li><strong>Приветик (Privetik):</strong> This is a very informal and sweet way to say “hi” in Russian. Reserved mostly for female speakers, Приветик (Privetik) is basically the diminutive form of Привет (Privyet).</li><li><strong>Здорово (Zdorovo):</strong> If the previous greeting is reserved for female speakers, this one is more suitable for male speakers. It’s similar to saying “great” or “cool” but can be used as “hi”, “hey” or even “yo” among young friends.</li><li><strong>Приветствую (Privetstvuyu):</strong> This is a Russian word that means “I greet” or “I welcome”. Being more formal makes it perfect for official settings. For instance, you can use it when interacting with business associates or when the degree of formality is unclear. This greeting works for both formal and informal situations, setting it apart from all the other greetings we listed here.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hi-in-russian.jpg"                      alt="hi in russian" title="Russian Greetings: Common Phrases And Basic Words 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072199/17885" target="_top" id="2072199"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072199"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072199/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Russian-farewells"><a href="#4-Russian-farewells" class="headerlink" title="4. Russian farewells"></a>4. Russian farewells</h2><p> Goodbyes are just as important as greetings. When you’re taking your leave, you can bid adieu with<strong>До свидания (Do svidaniya)</strong> in Russian, which means “until we see each other again”. Some of the most common Russian farewells include:</p><ul><li><strong>До свидания (Do svidaniya) – Goodbye:</strong> This is applicable to any scenario, either formal or informal. It’s the Здравствуйте (Zdravstvuyte) of Russian goodbyes.</li><li><strong>Пока (Poka)</strong> – Bye: This is the equivalent of Привет (Privyet) for goodbyes, so it’s the perfect choice for informal settings and saying a friendly “bye” to your friends or peers.</li><li><strong>До встречи (Do vstrechi)</strong> – See you soon: This is a bit more formal than Пока (Poka) and technically very similar to До свидания (Do svidaniya). The only difference is that it implies that you actually intend to meet later with the person you’re addressing it to.</li><li><strong>Увидимся (Uvidimsya)</strong> – See you: It’s relatively informal and akin to the English “see you later”. You can tell your friends Увидимся (Uvidimsya) if you expect to meet them again in the near future.</li><li><strong>До скорого (Do skorogo)</strong> – See you soon: It’s a warm farewell, yet rather polite. In practice, it aligns more with “see you” than “see you soon”.</li></ul><h2 id="5-Helpful-phrases-for-greetings"><a href="#5-Helpful-phrases-for-greetings" class="headerlink" title="5. Helpful phrases for greetings"></a>5. Helpful phrases for greetings</h2><p> Now that you said “hello” in Russian, how will the conversation continue? It’s true that locals, including babushkas (grandmothers), will still shower you with hospitality regardless if you speak Russian or not.

Here’s what you should keep in mind if you’re meeting with Russian-speaking friends:</p><ul><li><strong>Cheek-kissing:</strong> In many parts of Russia, it’s common to greet close friends and relatives (especially women) with a trio of kisses on alternating cheeks. This might surprise foreigners, but it’s a warm and welcoming gesture.</li><li><strong>Handshakes:</strong> Handshakes are also common, especially among men. When doing so, make sure you make direct eye contact as it reflects respect.</li><li><strong>Using patronymics:</strong> If you know someone’s first name and patronymic (a middle name derived from the father’s first name), it’s polite to use both. For example, if you’re addressing a woman named Maria whose father’s name is Ivan, you’d call her Maria Ivanovna. For men, the ending is usually “ovich” or “evich” – so Ivanovich in this case.</li><li><strong>Genders:</strong> Russian is a gendered language, so adjectives (including those in greetings) will change depending on the gender of the person you’re talking to.</li></ul><p> Whether you are traveling to Russia or engaging in business there, a firm grasp of Russian greetings will always serve you well. As the saying goes, “The first hello can lead to a million things”. So, why not start that journey with a genuine Russian greeting?</p><p> If you feel like you need more information on Russian greetings, here are some frequently asked questions. Maybe you’ll find your answer here.</p><h3 id="How-can-I-learn-to-pronounce-Russian-words-correctly"><a href="#How-can-I-learn-to-pronounce-Russian-words-correctly" class="headerlink" title="How can I learn to pronounce Russian words correctly?"></a>How can I learn to pronounce Russian words correctly?</h3><p> Use transliteration.

This is why we pledged ourselves to give those who need it most the opportunity to learn languages with Mondly Premium for free.</p><p> <strong>One of the causes dearest to our heart is <a class="link"   href="http://www.fundaciondanny.org/" >Fundación Danny <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from Colombia to whom we donated 150 Premium subscriptions in an effort to help them make language learning accessible for Colombian children.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fundacion-danny-mondly-600x450.jpg"                      alt="fundacion danny mondly" title="Helping Those Who Need It Most: Fundación Danny From Colombia 2"                ></p><p> Colombian children attending the Danny Foundation courses.</p><p> Fundación Danny or Danny Foundation has been active since 2011 and its goal is to help children and young people from different places in Colombia to develop skills that can ensure a better future for them and their families. The foundation provides multiple courses from language learning to programming and even playing an instrument.</p><p> Danny Foundation is projected as an Educational Institution that targets children and adolescents from vulnerable strata to give them access to excellent learning standards. Its long term objective is to help these children face the challenges of the working world thus reducing poverty and social inequality.</p><p> <strong>DANNY stands for Developing Aptitudes for a New Nation and Youth.</strong></p><h2 id="Unlocking-the-power-of-social-good"><a href="#Unlocking-the-power-of-social-good" class="headerlink" title="Unlocking the power of social good"></a>Unlocking the power of social good</h2><p> When Andrés Rodríguez, the director of Danny Foundation, first came for our help, we knew right away we had to do it. For the children and adolescents that attend the foundations’ courses, language learning is not just a hobby, but the key to success. This is why we wanted to give them the opportunity to experience the transformational power of learning English with Mondly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/danny-foundation-mondly-468x600.jpg"                      alt="danny foundation mondly" title="Helping Those Who Need It Most: Fundación Danny From Colombia 3"                ></p><p> Graduation at the Danny Foundation.</p><blockquote><p><em>Learning English in Colombia is not an easy task. Schools do teach English but just once or twice per week and sometimes the teachers themselves are not as competent as they should be. So Mondly is a great opportunity for our students to practice English every day.</em></p><p><em>One of our favorite features in the app is the Chatbot because it recreates real situations and allows students to speak English the same way they would do in real life</em> , says Andrés Rodríguez, director of Danny Foundation.</p></blockquote><p> For the time being, there are 200 students aged 8 to 16 years old taking courses at the foundation, but Andrés wants to reach even more places in Colombia. So we want to thank the Danny Foundation for what they are doing on behalf of the youth of Columbia.</p><p> <strong>Whatever the goal, Mondly will always support the Danny Foundation in its endeavor to expand learning for every child in Colombia.</strong></p><ul><li><a class="link"

But why is it so hard for English speakers to approach this process? Here are the most complicated challenges:</p><ul><li>A new alphabet;</li><li>No shared vocabulary whatsoever between Arabic and Latin&#x2F; <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Romance languages <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ;</li><li>The language is based on inflections so subject, mood, and tense are communicated just by how you inflect your tone;</li><li>Plurals and their respective agreements with numbers are more complex than in English;</li><li>You must memorize the conjugation and vocalization for the active and passive voices for ten verb patterns.</li></ul><p> So, since the elephant is out of the room, you’re ready to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn Arabic online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  !

To be more precise, there’s the mother tongue, which is the official language, but also different accents and a lot of pronunciations depending on the locale. So, choose the type of Arabic you want to learn in relation to the region&#x2F;regions you are interested in. There’s also Modern Standard Arabic, one of the official languages of the UN.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087267/19272" target="_top" id="2087267"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087267"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087267/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Commence-with-just-the-basics"><a href="#Commence-with-just-the-basics" class="headerlink" title="Commence with just the basics"></a>Commence with just the basics</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/arabic-bead-necklace-960x640.jpg"                      alt="arabic bead necklace" title="Arabic For Beginners: A Step By Step Guide 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4081991&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> ‘Arabic bead necklace’ by Carlos Eduardo de Meneses©</p><p> What’s the first thing you tackle when you want to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn a new language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ?

The Arabic alphabet is what you would call an <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad" >abjad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  , meaning that it’s primarily made up of consonants and no vowels. Keep in mind that there are 28 letters in the alphabet, only one of them being a vowel.</p><p> So, when you encounter a written word there will be no way of knowing how to pronounce it unless you’ve heard it before.

But, with Arabic things will be a little more complicated. So, in an Arabic dictionary, the words will be organized around roots made up of three letters. With me so far?</p><p> In order to find a word, you need to already know its root and the letter that the root starts with, and this letter is not always the first letter in the word. So yeah, learning to use the dictionary will take some practice, but once you’ve mastered it will make things much simpler.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254762&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/11_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png"                      border="0"                > PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Start-practicing-and-speaking"><a href="#Start-practicing-and-speaking" class="headerlink" title="Start practicing and speaking"></a>Start practicing and speaking</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/coworkers-talking-960x640.jpg"                      alt="coworkers talking" title="Arabic For Beginners: A Step By Step Guide 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BSysTools%2BPDF%2BUnlocker"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/pdf-unlocker.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> ‘Coworkers’ by Mikhail Nilov©</p><p> Now that you know the basics, it’s high time you started using them.

Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Especially in Italy where the people are so warm and friendly! Just a simple <a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875"><strong>hello in Italian</strong></a> , like_Ciao_ ,<em>Buongiorno</em> or_Salve,_ can make all the difference in a conversation with an Italian native. Maybe add a_bacio sulla guancia_ (kiss on the cheek) to that if it is appropriate and they will absolutely love you! And don’t think that this is just “an Italian thing”. No. Your attempt to speak the local language will surely be regarded as a sign of respect everywhere you go in the world. So get your greetings on point before traveling to a foreign country. You never get a second chance to make a good first impression!</p><h2 id="1-How-to-say-“hello”-in-Italian"><a href="#1-How-to-say-“hello”-in-Italian" class="headerlink" title="1.

In fact, I’d say it is universal and used in many countries between friends as a joke. Together, of course, with_Capisce_ (“Do you understand?”). We all use_Capisce_ and_Buongiorno_ (“<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Good morning <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> “) when we want to summon our inner Italians, don’t we?

Let’s discover the best ways to<strong>say hello in Italian</strong> and how it is appropriate to use them, depending on the social context you are in.</p><h3 id="Hello-in-Italian-–-Salve"><a href="#Hello-in-Italian-–-Salve" class="headerlink" title="Hello in Italian – Salve!"></a><strong>Hello in Italian – Salve!</strong></h3><p> The Italian culture is renowned for its deep respect for the elderly. That is why you should always be a bit more formal in one-to-one interactions with older people or with people you don’t personally know. In this kind of situation, you can safely use_Salve._ To put it into perspective,<em>Ciao</em> is the Italian equivalent of “Hi” while_Salve_ is the equivalent of “Hello”.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ancheer.sjv.io/c/5597632/1657301/17326" target="_top" id="1657301"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1657301"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="933"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657301/17326"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Hi-in-Italian-–-Ciao"><a href="#Hi-in-Italian-–-Ciao" class="headerlink" title="Hi in Italian – Ciao!"></a><strong>Hi in Italian – Ciao!</strong></h3><p> Definitely, your best choice for an informal situation,<em>Ciao,</em> derived from the Venetian phrase_S-ciào vostro_ or_S-ciào su,_ literally meaning “I am your slave”. However, the expression was not to be taken literally. Its real meaning was rather a promise of goodwill among friends (the same “at your service” was used in English).</p><p> The phrase was later shortened to_Ciào_ , lost its servile connotations, and started being used as an informal greeting by all people regardless of their class.</p><p> Moving on to other ways to<strong>say hello in Italian</strong> , if you want to greet a group of friends, you can also say**<em>Ciao a tutti</em>** which means “Hello everybody”. Depending on your relationship with the members of the group you are greeting, you can also say**<em>Salve a tutti</em>** or you can greet each and every one of them differently.</p><p> In Italy, it is also possible to hear children say_Ciao-ciao,_ which is the cuter version of_Ciao_ and it translates to “Bye-bye”.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://uperfect.sjv.io/c/5597632/1246754/15155" target="_top" id="1246754"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15155-1246754"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1246754/15155"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Italian-greetings-for-certain-moments-of-the-day"><a href="#2-Italian-greetings-for-certain-moments-of-the-day" class="headerlink" title="2.

How to say</strong> “<strong>goodbye</strong> ”<strong>in Italian</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Arrivederci</em></strong> is the most common way to say<strong>“goodbye” in Italian.</strong> The same as_Ciao_ , it can be used safely in all kinds of social contexts (formal or informal).<br> However, you should note that, depending on when you say it,<em>Ciao</em> can also mean “Goodbye”. So yeah, it’s now safe to say that_Ciao_ is an all-purpose greeting.<br> On the other hand, if you want to say goodbye, let’s say, to_la nonna della famiglia_ (the grandmother of the family), you’ll want to be a bit more formal than_Arrivederci_ . In that situation,<em>Arrivederla</em> is recommended.</p><p> Want more?

From the rhythmic beats that make our feet tap to the soulful melodies that stir our hearts, this universal language has an undeniable power over humanity. It moves us – physically, emotionally and psychologically as it increases blood flow to areas of the brain that generate and control emotions. It can uplift us, calm us, and even help us focus. But can you learn a language through music? Do music and language really go hand in hand?</p><p> Probably the most interesting theory on how music helps our brain is the Mozart effect. This theory suggests that the music of Mozart “makes you smarter”. There are probably hundreds of Youtube playlists with Mozart’s music for “brain power”. However, it seems that the results of the original study were highly exaggerated. Nonetheless, as I write these lines, I listen to classical music and I can confirm it helps me concentrate.</p><p> As we delve into this fascinating exploration, let’s hit ‘play’ on our favorite tune and find out whether learning a language through music actually works.</p><h2 id="Music-and-language-go-together-like-Beyonce-and-Jay-Z"><a href="#Music-and-language-go-together-like-Beyonce-and-Jay-Z" class="headerlink" title="Music and language go together like Beyoncé and Jay-Z"></a>Music and language go together like Beyoncé and Jay-Z</h2><p> Whether you’re tuning into music to concentrate better while learning a new language (with <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-8155&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-8155&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-8155" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), or you’re enjoying songs in the language you’re trying to learn, keep it up! It will only accelerate the process.</p><p> Movies, books and music are all fun ways to improve your understanding of a new language. However, if you’re just starting, music is your best choice as it doesn’t feel as overwhelming as reading a book, for example. You just go with the flow.</p><p>Music and language go together like Beyoncé and Jay-Z for many reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Better pronunciation and accent:</strong> Songs in a foreign language can significantly improve your pronunciation because they introduce you to the native rhythm, speed, and intonation of the language. As you sing along or simply listen, you mimic the pronunciation, making your spoken language sound more natural.</li><li><strong>Enhanced memory:</strong> It’s always easier to remember new phrases and words if you put them on some catchy music. The songs act as a mnemonic device, making the words easier to recall. What’s a mnemonic device? Just that: a memory technique that can help increase your ability to recall and retain information.</li><li><strong>Improved vocabulary:</strong> Songs are filled with everyday vocabulary, idioms, and expressions. By listening to music, you’re exposed to the most commonly used words in context, which helps you understand what they mean and how to use them.</li><li><strong>Better understanding of grammar and structure:</strong> Through song lyrics, you can get exposed to many different grammar structures. This way, you can get a feel for how sentences are constructed in a particular language.</li><li><strong>Increased cultural understanding:</strong> By listening to the right music, you can get valuable insights into a country’s culture, history and values.</li></ul><h2 id="Scientifically-proven-learning-a-language-through-music-works"><a href="#Scientifically-proven-learning-a-language-through-music-works" class="headerlink" title="Scientifically proven: learning a language through music works"></a>Scientifically proven: learning a language through music works</h2><p> Okay, learning a language through music works, but is it scientifically proven? The answer is yes. Over the years, there have been multiple studies regarding music’s positive impact on language acquisition. Needless to say, all of them had encouraging results for all those wanting to ease the process of learning a new language.</p><p> In a compelling <a class="link"   href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307917016%5FLanguage%5FLearning%5FEnhanced%5Fby%5FMusic%5Fand%5FSong" >study <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> carried out at Nelson Mandela University in South Africa, the strategic use of song and music was found to boost the motivation of English language learners significantly. The study participants, most of whom had only a rudimentary understanding of English, remarkably demonstrated their ability to dissect contemporary music lyrics as if they were poetry, all thanks to the engaging medium of music.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/listening-to-music-in-spanish-960x640.jpg"                      alt="&#39;Listening to music in Spanish&#39; by Nicholas Githiri©" title="The Power Of Music When Learning A New Language – Sing That Language! 2"                ></p><p> Another <a class="link"   href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249966411%5FSinging%5Fcan%5Ffacilitate%5Fforeign%5Flanguage%5Flearning" >study <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> published in the journal Memory &amp; Cognition demonstrates that melodies can help in learning and recalling new phrases in a foreign language. This is because music and language share neural pathways in the brain, particularly in areas responsible for auditory processing and memory. The process of attaching words to a rhythmic pattern or melody helps reinforce memory retention of those words.</p><p> Furthermore, a <a class="link"   href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6162612/" >study <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the journal Brain Sciences showed that exposure to music at a young age can improve linguistic abilities, emphasizing the connection between music and language development. The rhythm and pitch variations in music mirror the modulation and stress patterns in language, helping learners understand and mimic these patterns.</p><p> The list of studies can continue – all showing the same promising results.

Here are the types of songs that are most suitable for learning new words and phrases in a new language:</p><ul><li><strong>Simple and repetitive songs:</strong> Ideal for language learners, songs with simple and recurring lyrics can reinforce basic vocabulary and grammar.</li><li><strong>Children’s songs:</strong> Given their simplicity and clarity, children’s songs are great for language learners who are just starting out.</li><li><strong>Pop songs:</strong> Pop songs are a perfect choice for language learners, as they are fun and have very catchy and have easy-to-remember lyrics.</li><li><strong>Folk songs:</strong> Folk songs, rich with storytelling and cultural references, can deepen learners’ understanding of the language and its culture.</li><li><strong>Songs with clear pronunciation:</strong> Songs with distinct and clear pronunciation can aid learners aiming to improve their own pronunciation and accent.</li><li><strong>Songs with translated lyrics:</strong> For those keen to grasp the meaning of the lyrics and learn new words and phrases, songs with translated lyrics can be beneficial.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/music-language-960x640.jpg"                      alt="&#39;Music language&#39; by Jamakassi©" title="The Power Of Music When Learning A New Language – Sing That Language! 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084396/18498" target="_top" id="2084396"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084396"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="700"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084396/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Learning-a-new-language-with-songs-tips-and-tricks"><a href="#Learning-a-new-language-with-songs-tips-and-tricks" class="headerlink" title="Learning a new language with songs: tips and tricks"></a>Learning a new language with songs: tips and tricks</h2><p> Once you have chosen your favorite songs in the language you’re trying to learn, the idea is to have fun and listen carefully. We’re all vibin’ to<strong>Shakira’s new revenge Spanish song</strong> for Pique, but do we understand what she’s saying? If you’re listening to music in Spanish in an effort to learn the language, make sure you’re doing it right. Here are a few tips and tricks you should keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Select suitable songs:</strong> Choose songs that match your language level. If you’re a beginner, choose songs with simple vocabulary and clear pronunciation. Advanced learners can pick songs with more intricate language and quicker lyrics.</li><li><strong>Tune in to the song:</strong> Listen to the song a few times without trying to understand every word. Concentrate on the melody, rhythm, and mood of the song – enjoy it. Notice any recurring phrases or sequences.</li><li><strong>Search for the lyrics:</strong> Find the lyrics of the song in the original language and in your native language. Read through the lyrics and try to understand the meaning of each phrase.</li><li><strong>Learn the vocabulary:</strong> Use a dictionary to clarify any unknown words and compile a list of new vocabulary. Practice saying the words out loud and try to memorize their meanings.</li><li><strong>Sing along:</strong> While listening to the song again, attempt to sing along. Pay attention to your pronunciation and try to match the rhythm and intonation of the singer.</li><li><strong>Practice pronunciation:</strong> If you’re brave enough (some of us aren’t), record yourself singing the song and listen to it. Identify any areas where you need to improve your pronunciation and practice only those sections.</li><li><strong>Analyze the grammar:</strong> Look for examples of grammar structures in the song, such as verb tenses, prepositions, and conjunctions. Try to identify their contextual use.</li><li><strong>Use the song to practice speaking:</strong> Use the song lyrics as conversation starters with a language partner or tutor. You can also use the song as a prompt for writing exercises, such as writing a short story or describing a scene.</li></ul><p> Once you’ve discovered a band or artist that you like, try to learn as much as possible about them. Aim to understand their origins and their inspirations, as this can enrich your comprehension of the cultural backdrop of their music.</p><p> The bottom line is this: learning a language through music is possible. Especially if you’re only starting to learn the language and<strong>can’t live without Spotify</strong> . All you have to do is enjoy the process and learn what you can from it. Now let’s recap a few things.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l2QDLujtcAvAr2gRa/giphy.gif"                      alt="music language" title="The Power Of Music When Learning A New Language – Sing That Language! 5"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997817/17059" target="_top" id="1997817"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-1997817"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997817/17059"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/2016067/18544" target="_top" id="2016067"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-2016067"                      border="0" alt="" width="1020" height="380"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2016067/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-to-learn-a-language-by-listening-to-music"><a href="#How-to-learn-a-language-by-listening-to-music" class="headerlink" title="How to learn a language by listening to music?"></a>How to learn a language by listening to music?</h3><p> One way to learn a language through music is to listen to songs in the target language and try to follow along with the lyrics.

In our globalized reality, the ability to navigate diverse cultural landscapes is essential. This article cuts to the core, offering actionable strategies for honing your communication skills across cultures. From language nuances to nonverbal cues, you’ll discover how to engage effectively and respectfully with individuals from various backgrounds. Dive in to elevate your intercultural dialogue and connection.</p><h2 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h2><ul><li>Intercultural communication is essential in global business environments and requires understanding cultural differences, language proficiency, and adapting to social norms to avoid misunderstandings and foster inclusivity.</li><li>Overcoming cultural barriers and developing intercultural competence involves emotional intelligence, cultural awareness, and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >language skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to navigate diverse cultural landscapes and promote harmonious work environments.</li><li>Effective intercultural communication extends to real-world applications such as international relations, global market expansion, and management within multinational corporations, being a key determinant of success in the interconnected global business landscape.</li></ul><h2 id="The-Essence-of-Intercultural-Communication"><a href="#The-Essence-of-Intercultural-Communication" class="headerlink" title="The Essence of Intercultural Communication"></a>The Essence of Intercultural Communication</h2><p> Intercultural communication refers to the exchange of information between individuals from different cultural backgrounds. In global business environments, it proves instrumental, as success often hinges on understanding cultural differences, mastering language skills, and respecting social norms.</p><p> The way we perceive and interpret the world around us is influenced by our cultural backgrounds, which in turn shapes our communication styles and behaviors. Hence, effective intercultural communication necessitates an understanding of these cultural variables.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Cultural-Differences"><a href="#Cultural-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Cultural Differences"></a>Cultural Differences</h3><p> In global business communication, the recognition and understanding of cultural differences are indispensable. They help to avoid misunderstandings and encourage respect and inclusivity in a diverse workplace. These differences can manifest in various forms, such as different communication styles, workplace etiquette, and organizational hierarchy norms. For instance, the contrasting power distance cultures of Indian and German employees can lead to varying expectations and behaviors in a business setting.</p><p> Thus, being aware of these differences is a prerequisite for effective global business interactions. This awareness goes beyond mere acknowledgment of cultural diversity, extending to the understanding and respect for the values, beliefs, and practices inherent in diverse cultures. By doing so, businesses can create an inclusive work environment that values diversity and promotes effective intercultural communication.</p><h3 id="Language-Proficiency"><a href="#Language-Proficiency" class="headerlink" title="Language Proficiency"></a>Language Proficiency</h3><p> In international business, robust language skills are fundamental to establish and strengthen relationships, negotiate effectively, and guarantee mutual understanding among global partners. Misunderstandings arising from <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >language barriers can result in lost business <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> opportunities, conflicts, and a decline in trust between international partners.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Language learning <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> serves as a key tool for overcoming these communication barriers, enabling individuals to:</p><ul><li>establish and enhance cross-cultural relationships</li><li>acknowledge and incorporate linguistic diversity in multinational corporations</li><li>respect all employees’ cultural backgrounds</li><li>facilitate better global operations</li></ul><p> While <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >English is commonly the business <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> lingua franca, multinational corporations are increasingly focusing on reciprocal education to achieve these goals.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.emeditor.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4610657&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/emeditor_chat_ai.png"                      border="0"                ><br>EmEditor is a fast, lightweight, yet extensible, easy-to-use text editor, code editor, CSV editor, and large file viewer for Windows.

New versions support AI-assisted writing.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Social-Norms"><a href="#Social-Norms" class="headerlink" title="Social Norms"></a>Social Norms</h3><p> Social norms, comprising unofficial rules that dictate expected behaviors, greatly influence workplace interactions and can vary widely with culture and context. Identifying and adapting to social norms, including punctuality, workplace etiquette, and organizational hierarchy, is of utmost importance in international business to circumvent cultural misunderstandings.</p><p> Nonverbal communication, like gestures, can also have significantly different meanings in various cultural contexts, affecting intercultural communication. For instance, the ‘OK’ sign or ‘thumbs up’ might be interpreted differently based on the cultural background of the recipient. Similarly, cultural differences in the norms of touching and physical proximity during interactions necessitate an understanding of nonverbal cues for effective intercultural communication. Some examples of nonverbal cues that can vary across cultures include:</p><ul><li>Hand gestures</li><li>Facial expressions</li><li>Eye contact</li><li>Body language</li><li>Personal space</li></ul><p> Being aware of these cultural differences can help avoid misunderstandings and promote better communication.</p><h2 id="Overcoming-Cultural-Barriers"><a href="#Overcoming-Cultural-Barriers" class="headerlink" title="Overcoming Cultural Barriers"></a>Overcoming Cultural Barriers</h2><p> Effective intercultural communication inherently involves overcoming cultural barriers. These barriers can take many forms, such as:</p><ul><li>Anxiety when communicating with individuals from other cultures</li><li>The assumption of similarities</li><li>Ethnocentrism</li><li>Stereotypes</li><li>Prejudice</li></ul><p> Each of these can create discomfort, lead to awkward interactions, or even result in avoidance of intercultural communication.</p><p> The cultivation of patience is essential to building relationships, surmounting barriers, fostering mutual understanding, and comfort during interactions, particularly in the context of global market expansion.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a class="link"   href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729642&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1" >Advanced Find and Replace for Google Sheets, Lifetime subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Own-Culture-Bias"><a href="#Own-Culture-Bias" class="headerlink" title="Own Culture Bias"></a>Own Culture Bias</h3><p> Ethnocentrism is a common form of own culture bias where individuals judge other cultures based on their own cultural norms. This bias can potentially foster a sense of superiority and misunderstanding, which can be detrimental to effective intercultural communication. Understanding how personal behaviors and reactions are shaped by cultural influences necessitates the recognition and introspection of one’s own culture.</p><p> Cultural sensitivity acknowledges the diverse similarities and differences between cultures and promotes respect towards this diversity. Workplace guidelines that encourage cultural awareness can ensure ethical interactions among employees from different backgrounds, helping to clarify behavioral expectations. For the creation of a non-discriminatory environment that fosters team development and cultural insight, challenging stereotypes and biases becomes vital, especially during global market expansion.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.dbschema.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19867419&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/176b22bab4e94a28619ca2433b2ef241/products/1_icon256.png"                      border="0"                ><br>DbSchema database designer for all databases, schema design in the team, schema deployment, interactive diagrams, documentation, data and query tools. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Nonverbal-Communication"><a href="#Nonverbal-Communication" class="headerlink" title="Nonverbal Communication"></a>Nonverbal Communication</h3><p> Nonverbal communication constitutes a significant part of our daily interactions. It’s not just about the words we say, but also how we say them. This includes our:</p><ul><li>Facial expressions</li><li>Tone of voice</li><li>Body language</li><li>Pace of speech</li></ul><p> Understanding these subtle differences becomes paramount in the realm of intercultural communication. Language proficiency is essential not just for verbal interactions but also for grasping the subtle differences in nonverbal communication across cultures.</p><p> Facial expressions are globally recognized, but their interpretations can vary widely among different cultures, impacting intercultural communication. Observing and respecting varied body language and preferences of those from different cultures helps prevent misunderstandings and enhance communication.</p><p>Some tips for effective intercultural communication include:</p><ul><li>Being aware of cultural differences in body language and nonverbal cues</li><li>Avoiding assumptions and stereotypes about how people from different cultures express themselves</li><li>Asking questions and seeking clarification when unsure about someone’s nonverbal communication</li><li>Being open-minded and adaptable to different communication styles</li></ul><p> Mirroring body language in an intercultural context may be perceived as offensive, suggesting that a careful approach must be taken toward adopting nonverbal behaviors.</p><p> Adapting to another culture’s nonverbal norms can lead to better understanding and stronger relationships during intercultural exchanges.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39694080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/nbr/fire/Screenshot_1red_gb.jpg"                      border="0"                >Nero Burning ROM:<br>The ultimate burning program for all your needs!</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Culture-Shock"><a href="#Culture-Shock" class="headerlink" title="Culture Shock"></a>Culture Shock</h3><p> Culture shock is a common experience for individuals venturing into unfamiliar cultural environments. It can manifest in feelings of confusion, disorientation, and anxiety as one navigates the unfamiliar customs, practices, and social norms of a new culture. However, understanding behaviors from different cultural perspectives in the face of culture shock requires patience, positivity, and an open mind.</p><p> Accepting and expecting homesickness as a common experience can allow individuals to better cope with culture shock. Realizing that adjustment to a new culture takes time is key, and patience is important during the initial period of culture shock. Embracing opportunities to make new friends and learning about their cultures can enhance the adjustment process. Finding stress-relief activities such as exercise or joining clubs can provide comfort and a sense of community during the culture shock phase.</p><h2 id="Developing-Intercultural-Competence"><a href="#Developing-Intercultural-Competence" class="headerlink" title="Developing Intercultural Competence"></a>Developing Intercultural Competence</h2><p> The journey to develop intercultural competence involves honing our emotional intelligence, enhancing our cultural awareness, and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >improving our language skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . These aspects are fundamental pillars for developing intercultural competence in the business world. They equip leaders with cultural intelligence, thereby enhancing their ability to navigate diverse teams and promote a harmonious work environment.</p><p> Moreover, diverse teams, innovation, dedicated staff, and profitability are key business benefits that are enhanced by good intercultural communication skills.</p><h3 id="Emotional-Intelligence"><a href="#Emotional-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="Emotional Intelligence"></a>Emotional Intelligence</h3><p> Intercultural communication critically hinges on emotional intelligence. It involves understanding and managing one’s own emotions and those of others in cross-cultural interactions, with empathy playing a crucial role in creating a positive and inclusive communication environment. Respect for an individual’s cultural background, beliefs, and values is fundamental in building trust and rapport, necessary for successful cross-cultural communication.</p><p> Patience is a necessary virtue when engaging with people from different cultures as it allows for trust to develop over time, and helps to avoid stereotypes and misunderstandings. Understanding emotions as a universal language helps transcend cultural barriers and promotes cultural sensitivity, which is essential for recognizing and managing emotions effectively in diverse cultural surroundings.</p><h3 id="Cultural-Awareness"><a href="#Cultural-Awareness" class="headerlink" title="Cultural Awareness"></a>Cultural Awareness</h3><p> Intercultural competence significantly depends on cultural awareness. It entails recognizing both the similarities and differences inherent among various cultural identities.

No matter the circumstances, friendly or professional, you can’t go wrong with a proper enthusiastic greeting.</p><p> Swedish people are sociable, and they care about traditions, so any foreigner should know how to, at least, properly introduce themselves and start a conversation. Learn more about all the Swedish greetings, and maybe you’ll feel inspired to try something new and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >start learning the Nordic language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Here’s some to start with:</p><h2 id="What-you-should-know"><a href="#What-you-should-know" class="headerlink" title="What you should know"></a>What you should know</h2><p> Swedes are respectful, but they rarely use last names or Mr. and Mrs in rather formal conversations as well. They like to call themselves by their first name, even in some professional circles. Equality and the lack of hierarchies in the workplace is a specific trait of the Swedish society. If you want to move to Sweden or visit the country, you must get accustomed to all these little details. This will make it easier for you to become “one of them” and meet new people</p><p> If you’re visiting and want to get a coffee, the simplest way to sound and look like a local is to throw in a smile and a <strong>“Hej!”</strong> (pronounced just like <em>Hey!</em>). This one is the perfect greeting, regardless of the time of day or to whom you address it.</p><h2 id="How-to-say-“Hello-”-in-Swedish"><a href="#How-to-say-“Hello-”-in-Swedish" class="headerlink" title="How to say “Hello!” in Swedish"></a>How to say “Hello!” in Swedish</h2><p> In more formal circumstances, you can use the word <strong>“hallå”</strong> (&#x2F;haˈloː&#x2F;). Sometimes, Swedes like to articulate the word when greeting someone by saying <strong>“</strong> <strong>Hallå, hallå!”</strong>  or even use it when they’re irritated and what to bring more attention to a situation they’re telling you about.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2090698/16836" target="_top" id="2090698"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2090698"                      border="0" alt="" width="720" height="300"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-answer-the-phone-in-Swedish"><a href="#How-to-answer-the-phone-in-Swedish" class="headerlink" title="How to answer the phone in Swedish"></a>How to answer the phone in Swedish</h2><p> Even if you’re just visiting, you might have to answer the phone at the hotel or when you’re expecting a call from the embassy, for example. The easiest way to do this is to say “Hello” followed by introducing yourself. This sounds something like : <strong>“</strong> <strong>Hallå! Det här är [your name].”</strong>  This will not only impress the person on the other end, but they might mistake you for a local. That would be a good thing, but you need to let them know you don’t speak Swedish fluently before they start talking faster.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-say-“Good-Morning-”-in-Swedish"><a href="#How-to-say-“Good-Morning-”-in-Swedish" class="headerlink" title="How to say “Good Morning!” in Swedish"></a>How to say “Good Morning!” in Swedish</h2><p> At the restaurant, cafés, or when you enter a building, saying “Good Morning!” is a sign of respect and will help you establish a connection with those around you. The Swedish equivalent of the morning greeting is <strong>“God morgon!”</strong>  . It’s important to use all the common greetings, even as a foreigner because you will most likely make a good impression.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38709260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF Perpetual (2-PC)  Free upgrade. No monthly fees ever. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-say-“Good-evening-”-in-Swedish"><a href="#How-to-say-“Good-evening-”-in-Swedish" class="headerlink" title="How to say “Good evening!” in Swedish"></a>How to say “Good evening!” in Swedish</h2><p><strong>“God kväll!”</strong> is a rather formal greeting in <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Swedish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  , but you might hear this in theaters, or when the evening news show starts.

Since we worked hard to create Mondly AR for about 9 months, our opinion would probably have been subjective. So we wanted to see how normal people react to Mondly AR when testing it for the first time. The result surprised us. Here’s how Clara, one of the students, reviewed the experience:</p><hr><p> <em>If you tried one of the<strong>Mondly language learning apps</strong> (available for both <a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-1295&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-1295&utm_source=blog-post-id-1295&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-1295&utm_source=blog-post-id-1295&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-1295&utm_source=blog-post-id-1295&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-1295&mt=8" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-1295&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-1295&utm_source=blog-post-id-1295&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-1295&utm_source=blog-post-id-1295&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-1295&utm_source=blog-post-id-1295&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-1295&mt=8" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> users), then you know that they already are a strong competitor for Duolingo and managed to literally catch our eyes with their <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >VR conversational chatbot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . But with the AR experience gaining so much ground, Mondly takes a further step and announces a new launch sooner than expected.</em></p><h2 id="Mondly-AR-uses-AR-to-change-the-way-we-learn-languages"><a href="#Mondly-AR-uses-AR-to-change-the-way-we-learn-languages" class="headerlink" title="Mondly AR uses AR to change the way we learn languages"></a><em>Mondly AR uses AR to change the way we learn languages</em></h2><p> <em>Many of my friends that speak <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >English as a second language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> told me the exact same story of learning English as a child: they all learned their basic vocabulary by watching English cartoons. That is what we all call learning through play. Now, I may be wrong, but it seems to me that this is also the concept that Mondly tries to cultivate with their new AR app.</em></p><p> <em>A few days ago I had the chance to try their new <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondlyar.languages&hl=en"><strong>augmented reality app</strong></a> and you will see why this made me believe that Mondly counts on the mix between innovation and the concept of learning through play; and why they might not be wrong in doing so.</em></p><p>_ <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ckAvyr8RNxvc0Tbued/giphy.gif"                      alt="AUGMENTED REALITY LION" title="The New Augmented Reality App From Mondly Is The Future Of Language Learning 2"                > _</p><h2 id="An-out-of-this-world-encounter"><a href="#An-out-of-this-world-encounter" class="headerlink" title="An out of this world encounter"></a><em>An out of this world encounter</em></h2><p> <em>The<strong>new augmented reality experience from Mondly</strong> introduces us to a new character named Mondly with whom you can talk in various contexts (she can even change her outfit and become a waitress at the restaurant) and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn a new language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the meantime. After all, we all know it is easier to learn a new language when you are being social. The rendez-vous  between me and my new virtual friend started after we scanned the room we were in using just the iPad’s camera. She immediately and seamlessly appeared in front of me. Her eyes met mine and I froze. It this even possible? That was just the beginning, but I already felt like a character in one of my favorite sci-fi shows.</em></p><p>_ <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5eF84ByiI55ql9Xyrk/giphy.gif"                      alt="AR Mondly Languages" title="The New Augmented Reality App From Mondly Is The Future Of Language Learning 3"                > _</p><p> <em>But the coolest feature is yet to come. You just have to ask her to show you an animal. “Show me a rabbit” – I said – and a virtual rabbit magically appeared on the floor. I got to tell you: I have never been so amazed when seeing a rabbit in my whole life. Besides that, I learned that “rabbit” is “conejo” in Spanish. The rabbit started jumping around and I suddenly felt that anything could happen at this point so I quickly asked her to show me another animal fearing that the rabbit could take me to Wonderland.</em></p><p> <em>The cow, the chicken and the flying eagle followed and I was simply mesmerized. I truly felt like a kid all over again. I walked around the room and discovered that I was capable to see Mondly and the animals from different angles and distances. I’m almost 24, but I’m quite sure that my 70 years old grandmother would also enjoy this as much as I did. When the elephant appeared I had to take a step back to see it better because it was enormous, like actual elephant size enormous.</em></p><p>_ <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/gC1iUtDE9Tkh0wDx3O/giphy.gif"                      alt="AUGMENTED REALITY MONDLY LANGUAGES" title="The New Augmented Reality App From Mondly Is The Future Of Language Learning 4"                > _</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4621764&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.x-mirage.com/x-mirage/img/page-home.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Building-the-future-of-learning-and-teaching"><a href="#Building-the-future-of-learning-and-teaching" class="headerlink" title="Building the future of learning and teaching"></a><em>Building the future of learning and teaching</em></h2><p> <em>On a more serious note, the <strong>new augmented reality app from <a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-1295&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-1295&utm_source=blog-post-id-1295&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-1295&utm_source=blog-post-id-1295&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-1295&utm_source=blog-post-id-1295&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-1295&mt=8" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  uses technologies like chatbot and speech recognition and brings your conversational friend in your environment for a “face to face” interaction. For a more realistic effect, your virtual language learning assistant uses a human voice especially for you and uses your input to respond accordingly.</em></p><p> <em>After this experience, I stopped for a second and imagined the possibilities. This new app (or module – I understand that the AR experience is available inside the main app) won’t only help us <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn a new language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the most pleasant and easiest way possible, it should and will also influence the way we teach our children. We are heading towards a heavily technologized visual era and school should not be a drudgery. School should be more like Mondly AR. Failing a French test in middle school isn’t the end of the world. Learn it faster and easier with Mondly and then focus on the important things in life. Learn through play regardless of your age or native language. Learn because you like it, not because you need it.</em></p><p>_ <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/C9pYCWN2mjxuWD0ufF/giphy.gif"                      alt="AR language learning app" title="The New Augmented Reality App From Mondly Is The Future Of Language Learning 5"                > _</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042323/17091" target="_top" id="2042323"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2042323"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="3840" height="1600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042323/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> <em>Now, I was indeed amazed, but there may be room for improvement.

Instead, they will still play, but in a more productive way because they will also learn a new language meanwhile using Mondly AR or any other app from Mondly.

Wishing someone to break their leg doesn’t sound especially friendly. But they are a valuable addition to your vocabulary. For instance, if you want to speak German like a fluent speaker, German idioms are probably the fastest way to get to it.</p><p> Once you start learning, the most exciting thing about<strong>German idioms</strong> is that <strong>they feel like learning a super secret code only the fluent speakers understand.</strong> As they provide useful insights into German culture and history, including idioms in your day-to-day conversations will make you sound like “one of their own.” So let’s cut to the chase and present you with the essential collection of German idioms designed to up your German game fast.</p><h2 id="Common-German-idioms-Germans-love"><a href="#Common-German-idioms-Germans-love" class="headerlink" title="Common German idioms Germans love"></a>Common German idioms Germans love</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/idiom" >Cambridge Dictionary <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> defines ‘idiom’ as “a group of words in a fixed order that has a particular meaning that is different from the meanings of each word on its own.” For example, to be “over the moon” is an idiom that means you are extremely happy or delighted. In other words, idioms have figurative, non-literal meanings because you’re not<strong>literally</strong> “over the moon.”</p><p> That being said, let’s see what such idioms Germans use the most in their daily interactions.</p><h3 id="1-Um-den-heisen-Brei-herumreden"><a href="#1-Um-den-heisen-Brei-herumreden" class="headerlink" title="1.Um den heißen Brei herumreden"></a>1.<em>Um den heißen Brei herumreden</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> To talk around the hot porridge.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> To beat around the bush.</p><p> Germans are usually pretty straightforward, but there are times when even they happen to beat around the bush. When such a situation occurs, you can use this idiom to invite them to get straight to the point.</p><h3 id="2-Eine-Extrawurst-haben"><a href="#2-Eine-Extrawurst-haben" class="headerlink" title="2. Eine Extrawurst haben"></a><strong>2.</strong> <em>Eine Extrawurst haben</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> To ask for an extra sausage.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> To ask for special treatment.</p><p> Germans and sausages go together like… well, Germans and sausages! For this reason, it’s no surprise that their idioms include_wursts_ . Even if the special treatment implies getting more dessert,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Germans will still say <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you’re asking for an extra sausage.</p><h3 id="3-Lugen-haben-kurze-Beine"><a href="#3-Lugen-haben-kurze-Beine" class="headerlink" title="3. Lügen haben kurze Beine"></a><strong>3.</strong> <em>Lügen haben kurze Beine</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> Lies have short legs.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> Lies won’t get you far.</p><p> Is someone lying to your face? Better remind them that_Lügen haben kurze Beine_ or lies won’t get them too far with those tiny legs. This idiom is similar to the English expression “Liar, liar, pants on fire.”</p><h3 id="4-Ich-glaube-ich-spinne"><a href="#4-Ich-glaube-ich-spinne" class="headerlink" title="4. Ich glaube ich spinne"></a><strong>4.</strong> <em>Ich glaube ich spinne</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> I believe I spider.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> I think I’m going crazy.</p><p> As odd as this one sounds, it will come in very handy in those situations when you can’t believe what you’re hearing or seeing. The English equivalent could be “You’ve got to be kidding me!”.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DBanner%2B728x90"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/2e76fe6a-3010-1b37-7846-f34ff9c6b4ca.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Seinen-Senf-dazugeben"><a href="#5-Seinen-Senf-dazugeben" class="headerlink" title="5.

While it’s true that any language learning will challenge your mind and expand your horizons, some languages offer more benefits than others. Hindi is one such language.</p><h2 id="Reasons-to-Study-Hindi"><a href="#Reasons-to-Study-Hindi" class="headerlink" title="Reasons to Study Hindi"></a>Reasons to Study Hindi</h2><h3 id="1-You’ll-Be-Able-to-Have-a-Conversation-with-Half-a-Billion-New-Friends"><a href="#1-You’ll-Be-Able-to-Have-a-Conversation-with-Half-a-Billion-New-Friends" class="headerlink" title="1. You’ll Be Able to Have a Conversation with Half a Billion New Friends"></a>1. You’ll Be Able to Have a Conversation with Half a Billion New Friends</h3><p> One of the main reasons that most people want to learn a language is to be able to communicate with more people around the world. Over half a billion people around the globe speak Hindi, making it the second most commonly spoken language on Earth. It’s also the official language of India.</p><h3 id="2-You’ll-Be-in-Good-Company"><a href="#2-You’ll-Be-in-Good-Company" class="headerlink" title="2. You’ll Be in Good Company"></a>2. You’ll Be in Good Company</h3><p> Hindi, being the official language of the second-biggest country on the planet, makes it an attractive option for people who want to learn an additional language. Up to 200 million people speak Hindi as their second language. If you become fluent, you’ll be joining a rather large and eclectic club, and since so many people are learning, you won’t struggle to find someone to practice with online.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.zonealarm.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=36245101&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sc1.checkpoint.com/sc1/za/images/boxes/zang_box_trust.png"                      border="0"                >ZoneAlarm Extreme Security NextGen</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-You’ll-Be-Working-in-India"><a href="#3-You’ll-Be-Working-in-India" class="headerlink" title="3.

Whether you’ll be doing graphic design for a resort in Mumbai or managing a technology firm in New Delhi, being fluent in Hindi will be highly beneficial.</p><p> The same could be said for those who live in English-speaking countries and work with people from India. Since so many tech jobs are currently being outsourced to the country, you might end up having regular phone calls with members of your team who speak Hindi. Not only will learning basic Hindi help you communicate better, but having these connections to native speakers will also help you practice your Hindi skills as you go. Most native speakers are more than happy to help, so if you have any questions for the Hindi speakers in your work environment, don’t be afraid to ask!<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arabic-1-scaled.jpeg"                      alt="arabic 1 scaled" title="8 Exciting Reasons To Study Hindi 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729320&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/2_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22889392&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://webstatic.nero.com/nero2015-com-wAssets/img/affiliate/media/banner728-90eng.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-You’ll-Have-Additional-Professional-Opportunities"><a href="#4-You’ll-Have-Additional-Professional-Opportunities" class="headerlink" title="4.

However, India’s thriving film industry is becoming a big competitor. In 2012, people bought over 2.6 billion tickets to see Bollywood <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >films <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which are known for their flashy musical numbers and over-the-top drama.</p><p> If you study Hindi, you’ll have access to films you might have missed out on otherwise. While it’s certainly possible to watch foreign films with subtitles, you’ll have a better viewing experience if you can understand what’s being said. In turn, watching Bollywood films is an excellent way to pick up on the subtle nuances of the language while you’re still learning.</p><h3 id="6-You’ll-be-Deepening-Your-Spirituality"><a href="#6-You’ll-be-Deepening-Your-Spirituality" class="headerlink" title="6.

Southern U.S. Drawl"></a>World English Waveforms: Australian Twang Vs. Southern U.S. Drawl</h2><p> One language, over one billion speakers, and countless ways to speak it. You guessed it. We’re talking about the fascinating <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5512&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5512&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5512" >English language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . So the big question is: with so many speakers, how many English accents are there?</p><p> Well, somewhere over<strong>40 english accents in the United Kingdom</strong> , but worldwide we can’t know for sure. As the saying goes “so many countries, so many customs”, so it’s fairly difficult to point the finger at one number. Maybe even you have your own English accent. But that doesn’t stop us from putting together a list of the most notable English accents of the worl…<em>uhm,</em> universe. From <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >British to American <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and even Aussie accent, let’s make the<strong>English accents</strong> inventory and find out how many ways of speaking English are there (at least roughly).</p><h2 id="What-is-an-accent"><a href="#What-is-an-accent" class="headerlink" title="What is an accent?"></a>What is an accent?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/accent" >Lexico <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> explains that an accent is “a distinctive way of pronouncing a language, especially one associated with a particular country, area, or social class”. Interesting, isn’t it? That is why you and maybe some of your friends in a particular area can create a new<strong>English accent</strong> of your own.</p><p> But chances are that one’s already used. As you probably already know, England isn’t short on accents. Travel north to south and it’ll give you the impression locals are speaking a whole new language.</p><p> Before moving to our actual introduction to various <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional%5Faccents%5Fof%5FEnglish#North%5FAmerica" >English accents and dialects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , take a few moments to think about which one is your favorite? Have you always dreamed of speaking English like the Queen of the United Kingdom? Or maybe like rugged Mr. Jamie Fraser from Outlander? Or are you a more American-oriented person and would go for a Matthew McConaughey-Texan style accent? So many fascinating choices!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/26BRCiSRp6d8j86rK/giphy.gif"                      alt="english acceents" title="English Accents: From Queen’s English To Aussie 9"                ></p><h2 id="British-Accent"><a href="#British-Accent" class="headerlink" title="British Accent"></a>British Accent</h2><p> Oh, the Brits! Judging by the<strong>British English</strong> accent you think they use, they are so royal, so sophisticated – or as they would presumably say – so_posh_ . But in reality, things are not entirely so. As we already hinted, the UK is incredibly rich in accents. Not everybody speaks British English like Benedict Cumberbatch or Martin Freeman. No, sir. A single British accent does not exist.</p><p> Lucky for you, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.bl.uk/british-accents-and-dialects/collection-items?view=list" >British Library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an incredible resource for people such as yourself who are interested in English accents and dialects. Here you’ll be able to search by country or by the map and even listen to how Britons speak all over the country. After just a quick search, I found no less than 77 audios of speakers from across the UK, chosen to represent different accents and dialects in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. That’s pure gold,<em>lad</em> ! Enjoy!</p><p> Let’s get down to work and review some of the most notable <a class="link"   href="https://oxfordhousebcn.com/en/a-brief-guide-to-different-british-accents-and-dialects/" >British accents <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you need to know from the British Isles and Ireland.</p><h3 id="Received-Pronunciation-or-Queen’s-English"><a href="#Received-Pronunciation-or-Queen’s-English" class="headerlink" title="Received Pronunciation or Queen’s English"></a>Received Pronunciation or Queen’s English</h3><p> If you are not a Brit but tried to put on a<strong>British accent</strong> at some point, the RP accent is most certainly what you were going for. Also known as the Queen’s&#x2F;Kings’s English or Oxford English, RP is the closest you can get to a “standard accent” in the UK.</p><p> The most important features of Received Pronunciation are non-rhoticity – meaning that the “r” at the end of the word isn’t pronounced and “mother” will sound like “muhthuh” – and trap-bath split. In broad terms, this means that certain words like “chance”, “bath”, “can’t”, and “dance” are pronounced with the long A as in “father”.</p><p> To hear RP in action, watch a lot of BBC or travel to Oxford, Cambridge, or Brighton and chat with the locals.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/british-accent-960x640.jpg"                      alt="british accent" title="English Accents: From Queen’s English To Aussie 10"                ></p><p> “All things British” by Aron Van de Pol©</p><p> Additionally, there’s even a heightened version of RP which is only really spoken in television or film. Think of Downton Abbey for reference.</p><h3 id="Cockney-Accent"><a href="#Cockney-Accent" class="headerlink" title="Cockney Accent"></a>Cockney Accent</h3><p> Cockney is perhaps the second most famous British English accent after RP. Born as the dialect of the working classes in the East End of London, Cockney is well-known for <a class="link"   href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Cockney%5Frhyming%5Fslang" >cockney rhyming slang <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is… fairly difficult to understand by outsiders.</p><p> Still regarded as a marker of “true” East End London heritage, Cockney accent is characterized by the glottal stop where the letter “t” is pronounced with less intensity, so words like “better” sound more like “be’uh”, and the tendency to swap the “th” sound for “f”, drop the “h” in front of words like “head” and elongate vowels like “a” and “e”.</p><p> To hear the Cockney accent in action, watch the movie Snatch – specifically Jason Statham’s character.</p><h3 id="Brummie-Accent"><a href="#Brummie-Accent" class="headerlink" title="Brummie Accent"></a>Brummie Accent</h3><p>Awww, doesn’t “Brummie” sound really cute?</p><p> Made famous worldwide “by order of the fo**ing Peaky Blinders”, the Brummie accent, or more formally the Birmingham dialect, was actually one of the most ridiculed English accents in the United Kingdom. Can you believe it?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3mZpcNC69UuXjoME/giphy-downsized-large.gif"                      alt="British accent" title="English Accents: From Queen’s English To Aussie 11"                ></p><p> But I guess it’s true what they say: he who laughs last, laughs best. Now the Brummie accent has millions of fans all over the world because everybody wants to speak – and dress – like Tommy Shelby.</p><h3 id="Scottish-Accent"><a href="#Scottish-Accent" class="headerlink" title="Scottish Accent"></a>Scottish Accent</h3><p> Born from the language contact between Scots and the Standard English of England in the late 1700s, the Scottish accent is a rhotic accent. This means that the “r” is pronounced and rolled. Additionally, this accent is also characterized by elongated vowel sounds and the glottal stop (the letter “t” is not pronounced between vowels).</p><p> To hear the Scottish accent in action, you can take a trip to Edinburgh, Glasgow, or watch the animated movie Brave which features multiple types of Scottish accents.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713324&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVTV1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV TV Webcaster</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Yorkshire-Accent"><a href="#Yorkshire-Accent" class="headerlink" title="Yorkshire Accent"></a>Yorkshire Accent</h3><p> The Yorkshire dialect (also known as Yorkie or Yorkshire English) is an <a class="link"   href="https://www.ef.com/wwen/blog/language/british-dialects-you-need-to-know/" >English accent <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of Northern England spoken in Yorkshire, the largest county in the UK.</p><p> Home to Leeds, York, and Sheffield, the Yorkshire accent is characterized by a different pronunciation of the letter “u”. Rather than pronouncing it “uh”, you’ll say “ooo”, so “blood” is pronounced “blohd” and “cut” – “coht”.</p><p> Additionally, words that end in “ee” are pronounced ‘eh’, for example, “happy” will sound more like “happeh” with the Yorkshire accent.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/british-english-960x640.jpg"                      alt="british english" title="English Accents: From Queen’s English To Aussie 12"                ></p><p> “Edinburgh, Scotland, UK” by Micheile Henderson©</p><p> Because this accent has roots in Old English and is influenced by Old Norse, the language of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Vikings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you’ll hear it used in many fantasy TV shows such as Game of Thrones.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653808&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Northern-Irish-Accent"><a href="#Northern-Irish-Accent" class="headerlink" title="Northern Irish Accent"></a>Northern Irish Accent</h3><p> If you watched at least one episode of Outlander, the Northern Irish accent will probably be your favorite on this list.

From the refined tones of Received Pronunciation to the colorful cadences of Cockney, and the melodic rhythms of Australian English, each accent tells a unique story of its speakers and their heritages.</p><p> So now you know quite a lot about English accents. What do you think? Which one is your favorite? Which one are you going to try to learn? Let me know in the comment section down below.</p><p> And don’t forget: there’s no such thing as “the best English accent”. Being good, bad, better or the best depends on where you are in the world. Of course, if you decide to live in the US, the General American Accent would be better, but most people won’t mind if you speak English your own way.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075471/7443" target="_top" id="2075471"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075471"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075471/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-is-the-most-common-English-accent"><a href="#What-is-the-most-common-English-accent" class="headerlink" title="What is the most common English accent?"></a>What is the most common English accent?</h3><p> The most common English accent varies depending on the context and region.
