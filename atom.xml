The answers lie in the learning process itself.</p><p>New language users typically pursue competency in the first 3-5 years it takes to learn a language. Then, we coast. We learn just enough English needed to achieve our goals.</p><p>Advanced learners don’t just pursue competency; they pursue <em>connection.</em></p><p>Nelson Mandela said:</p><blockquote><p>“If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.”</p></blockquote><p>Language learning, after all, is about more than just talking your mouth off. It’s about deep and authentic human connection, about relationships and making them stronger. Connection trumps competency. Connection is the ultimate sign of language excellence.</p><p>So how do we excel at connection? By becoming a lifelong learner of a language, no matter how good you already are at speaking it.</p><p>Anyone can become a lifelong learner, whether you’re in school or not, as long as you take learning seriously. Here are 5 powerful habits that all lifelong language learners should possess.</p><h2 id="1-Study-Body-Language"><a href="#1-Study-Body-Language" class="headerlink" title="1. Study Body Language"></a>1. Study Body Language</h2><blockquote><p>“Research indicates the pitch, volume, and pace of your voice affect what people think you said about FIVE TIMES as much as the actual words you used.” – Deborah Gruenfeld</p></blockquote><p>Body language focuses on visual cues used to express more information and emotion. Body language, however, also reveals what spoken language doesn’t: how you really feel.</p><p>Basic and intermediate language learners focus on the literal and exact words in conversation.</p><p>In personal or professional interactions, advanced students focus on the literal communication AND the visual. They learn to read the body language of others, and work to improve their own.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/DaNwD0SPavhF6/giphy.gif?cid=3640f6095c08f4ca7130495a6fa7153a"                      alt="giphy" title="How To Take Your English To The Next Level 2"                ></p><blockquote><p>“A conversation is so much more than words, a conversation is eyes, smiles, the silences between the words.” – Annika Thor</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4531356&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8fdd149fcaa7058caccc9c4ad5b0d89a/products/tss-box.JPG"                      border="0"                >The Tube Sites Submitter is a fast and efficient tool for anyone who needs to upload videos quickly, easily and automatically to hundreds of tube sites in mere minutes . </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Learn-to-Enjoy-Wordplay"><a href="#2-Learn-to-Enjoy-Wordplay" class="headerlink" title="2. Learn to Enjoy Wordplay"></a>2. Learn to Enjoy Wordplay</h2><p>How completely, and how rapidly, do you get jokes, spot puns, and catch lyrical or cultural references? How well do you understand wordplay while reading, conversing, or listening to music?</p><p>For advanced English learners, even the subtlest wordplay clicks within seconds, sometimes tenths of a second. Music, movies, and comedy are full of pop culture references, famous quotes, sarcasm, and all kinds of literary devices planted to delight the few members in the audience who are paying close attention.</p><p>Beginner and intermediate level users have a tougher time grasping all the puns or even enjoying figurative language. The advanced language learner loves playing with words and numbers, and as a result, they think quicker on their own feet in many aspects.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.emeditor.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4631722&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/frontpage2-2048x588.webp"                      border="0"                >EmEditor Professional (Lifetime License, non-store app)</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Get-Outside-Your-Comfort-Zone"><a href="#3-Get-Outside-Your-Comfort-Zone" class="headerlink" title="3. Get Outside Your Comfort Zone"></a>3. Get Outside Your Comfort Zone</h2><blockquote><p>“One good conversation can shift the direction of change forever.” – Linda Lam</p></blockquote><p>Most English speakers are capable of having full-blown conversations in private or in group settings within their inner circle, AKA the Comfort Zone. But what about speaking in front of a class or an office audience? What about impromptu conversations or polarizing debates with friends?</p><p>How well can you speak up and express yourself when stuck in a high-pressure situation?</p><p>Humans’ language skills tend to be weaker in these fight-or-flight situations, regardless of how articulate we are normally, so the question has to be asked: what are we doing to get better?</p><p>A true language expert has to practice a lot in order to learn to clearly express facts, opinions, and stories. It also takes a lot of practice to have the presence of mind to know when to be quiet, listen, and fully understand the other person.</p><p>Expanding your language comfort zone takes a lot of time and pain, and unless you’re naturally born this way, you can’t afford not to become natural at it.</p><p>Steal lessons on stretching your comfort zone from these masters of language:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theodysseyonline.com/public-speaking-lessons">Public speaking lessons revealed in Hasan Minhaj’s <em>The Homecoming King</em></a></li><li>_ <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Yes-Improvisation-Reverses-Creativity-Collaboration-Lessons/dp/0062248545" >Yes, And: How Improvisation Reverses “No, But” Thinking and Improves Creativity and Collaboration–Lessons from The Second City <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Excellence-Dividend-Meeting-Tech-Tide-ebook/dp/B074DHM8LH/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1533936817&sr=1-1&keywords=excellence+dividend" >The Excellence Dividend: Meeting the Tech Tide with Work That Wows and Jobs That Last <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851655&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Embrace-Old-English"><a href="#4-Embrace-Old-English" class="headerlink" title="4.

Let’s be honest, most of us never actually read the entire Shakespeare plays or classic novels that were mandatory for passing English Literature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://i.giphy.com/media/LYmPfp8dWUxnG/giphy.webp"                      alt="giphy" title="How To Take Your English To The Next Level 3"                ></p><p>It’s not that we were degenerate high school students; it’s because no matter how timeless and important the writing, we don’t appreciate Old English. It’s boring. It’s impossible to make sense of. It’s not how anyone talks any more, so it feels irrelevant. We can’t justify the time and frustration.</p><p>But where ordinary English users stop is where advanced learners get started. What we see as pointless, they see as opportunity – an opportunity to understand how our ancestors expressed thoughts and emotions, and viewed the world. An opportunity to understand the roots of language in human history. An opportunity to deeply appreciate older forms of art.</p><p>They identify the obstacles that make reading Old English so challenging, and come up with solutions, in order to get better. They stay calm and keep on reading until patterns start forming, one painful sentence after another, until literal and symbolic meanings become clear.</p><p>Want to take your language skills to the next level? Become a student of Old English and start reading Beowulf, and keep on reading until it starts to make sense.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920047/21774" target="_top" id="1920047"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920047"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920047/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Learn-Basic-Sign-Language"><a href="#5-Learn-Basic-Sign-Language" class="headerlink" title="5. Learn Basic Sign Language"></a>5. Learn Basic Sign Language</h2><p>Why after studying English for 25 years would I still only rate my English at an upper-intermediate level? Easy, not knowing a single sign language sign.</p><p>Not having deaf colleagues, friends, or family has always been my excuse to not learn sign language. What do I need it for? Who am I going to use it with? While researching the people, the history, and the stigmas surrounding <a class="link"   href="https://takelessons.com/blog/deaf-culture-asl" >Deaf culture <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> however, I quickly realized sign language isn’t just for people with hearing impairments.</p><p>More than two million people use sign language as their primary means of communication.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://i.giphy.com/media/l0MYzjlxBWJn24Wbe/giphy.webp"                      alt="giphy" title="How To Take Your English To The Next Level 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37100474&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://awario.com/images/pages/index/img-leads-1280@1x.avif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>It sounds silly, even crazy, to associate sign language ability with spoken language ability. Lifelong learners, however, realize that all forms of primary language – visual, verbal, and written – have equal importance and benefits.</p><p>Throughout history and even today, communication and connection have been lopsided between hearing people and deaf people. Deaf people have to learn to read and write in English. They have to learn to read lips, on top of learning sign language. The more hearing people learn <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HoC9_ir3s&feature=youtu.be" >basic sign language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the better we’ll all be able to understand one another.</p><p>Lifelong learners of language don’t just stop at 5 years. They work on getting better at it nearly their whole life. Many students will realize that mastering English requires a little more dedication than they originally anticipated, but in the end, the authentic human connections that will be forged make it all worth doing.</p><hr><p><strong>Author Bio:</strong> <em>Raj Shah is a senior manager and lifelong-learning advocate at <a class="link"   href="https://takelessons.com/live" >TakeLessons Live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an EdTech company that offers online courses in several popular subjects.</em></p><hr><h4 id="Speak-a-new-language-in-just-10-minutes-a-day"><a href="#Speak-a-new-language-in-just-10-minutes-a-day" class="headerlink" title="Speak a new language in just 10 minutes a day"></a>Speak a new language in just 10 minutes a day</h4><p>Want to learn more?

Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Especially in Italy where the people are so warm and friendly! Just a simple <a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875"><strong>hello in Italian</strong></a> , like_Ciao_ ,<em>Buongiorno</em> or_Salve,_ can make all the difference in a conversation with an Italian native. Maybe add a_bacio sulla guancia_ (kiss on the cheek) to that if it is appropriate and they will absolutely love you! And don’t think that this is just “an Italian thing”. No. Your attempt to speak the local language will surely be regarded as a sign of respect everywhere you go in the world. So get your greetings on point before traveling to a foreign country. You never get a second chance to make a good first impression!</p><h2 id="1-How-to-say-“hello”-in-Italian"><a href="#1-How-to-say-“hello”-in-Italian" class="headerlink" title="1. How to say “hello” in Italian"></a>1. How to say “hello” in Italian</h2><p><em>Ciao</em> is undeniably the most common Italian greeting. In fact, I’d say it is universal and used in many countries between friends as a joke. Together, of course, with_Capisce_ (“Do you understand?”). We all use_Capisce_ and_Buongiorno_ (“<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Good morning <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> “) when we want to summon our inner Italians, don’t we? Hahaha!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/HPZubh6ApHpN6/giphy.gif"                      alt="italian" title="How To Say Hello In Italian: Top 10 Italian Greetings 2"                ></p><p> But there’s more to<strong>Italian greetings</strong> than just_Ciao_ . Let’s discover the best ways to<strong>say hello in Italian</strong> and how it is appropriate to use them, depending on the social context you are in.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4621764&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.x-mirage.com/x-mirage/img/page-home.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Hello-in-Italian-–-Salve"><a href="#Hello-in-Italian-–-Salve" class="headerlink" title="Hello in Italian – Salve!"></a><strong>Hello in Italian – Salve!</strong></h3><p> The Italian culture is renowned for its deep respect for the elderly. That is why you should always be a bit more formal in one-to-one interactions with older people or with people you don’t personally know. In this kind of situation, you can safely use_Salve._ To put it into perspective,<em>Ciao</em> is the Italian equivalent of “Hi” while_Salve_ is the equivalent of “Hello”.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006123/18460" target="_top" id="2006123"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006123"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006123/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Hi-in-Italian-–-Ciao"><a href="#Hi-in-Italian-–-Ciao" class="headerlink" title="Hi in Italian – Ciao!"></a><strong>Hi in Italian – Ciao!</strong></h3><p> Definitely, your best choice for an informal situation,<em>Ciao,</em> derived from the Venetian phrase_S-ciào vostro_ or_S-ciào su,_ literally meaning “I am your slave”. However, the expression was not to be taken literally. Its real meaning was rather a promise of goodwill among friends (the same “at your service” was used in English).</p><p> The phrase was later shortened to_Ciào_ , lost its servile connotations, and started being used as an informal greeting by all people regardless of their class.</p><p> Moving on to other ways to<strong>say hello in Italian</strong> , if you want to greet a group of friends, you can also say**<em>Ciao a tutti</em>** which means “Hello everybody”. Depending on your relationship with the members of the group you are greeting, you can also say**<em>Salve a tutti</em>** or you can greet each and every one of them differently.</p><p> In Italy, it is also possible to hear children say_Ciao-ciao,_ which is the cuter version of_Ciao_ and it translates to “Bye-bye”.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BOST%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/ost-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Italian-greetings-for-certain-moments-of-the-day"><a href="#2-Italian-greetings-for-certain-moments-of-the-day" class="headerlink" title="2.

How to say “goodbye ”in Italian"></a><strong>3. How to say</strong> “<strong>goodbye</strong> ”<strong>in Italian</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Arrivederci</em></strong> is the most common way to say<strong>“goodbye” in Italian.</strong> The same as_Ciao_ , it can be used safely in all kinds of social contexts (formal or informal).<br> However, you should note that, depending on when you say it,<em>Ciao</em> can also mean “Goodbye”. So yeah, it’s now safe to say that_Ciao_ is an all-purpose greeting.<br> On the other hand, if you want to say goodbye, let’s say, to_la nonna della famiglia_ (the grandmother of the family), you’ll want to be a bit more formal than_Arrivederci_ . In that situation,<em>Arrivederla</em> is recommended.</p><p> Want more? Here are other ways to say goodbye in Italian that are suitable for both formal and informal situations:</p><ul><li>See you later. –<em>A dopo.</em></li><li>See you in a bit. –<em>A fra poco.</em></li><li>See you tomorrow. –<em>A domani.</em></li><li>See you soon. –<em>A presto.</em></li></ul><h2 id="4-Other-basic-Italian-phrases-that-you-should-know"><a href="#4-Other-basic-Italian-phrases-that-you-should-know" class="headerlink" title="4.

Other basic Italian phrases that you should know</h2><p> If you want to travel to Italy, you should know that this is where you’ll meet one of the kindest, friendliest and most talkative people in Europe. Don’t believe us? Well, hear this! If you are familiar enough, the Italians will even give you an_bacio sulla guancia_ (kiss on the cheek). Careful though! Not every social interaction calls for a cheek kiss. So don’t take the first step yet. In time, you will learn the proper Italian behavior.</p><p> The bottom line is that one week in Italy is enough to fill yourself with positive energy and joy <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875"                      alt="**Learn Italian**"                > , book your trip and see for yourself.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1047974&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-04_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Now let us go back to the point.

During this time, the language underwent several dramatic changes that eventually shaped it to the Bulgarian we can all <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5454&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5454?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=bg&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5454?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=bg" >learn today with Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Written in the Cyrillic alphabet and spoken in Bulgaria and parts of Romania, Moldova, Greece and Ukraine, Bulgarian was the first “Slavic” language attested in writing. Since Slavic linguistic unity lasted until late antiquity, the earliest manuscripts initially referred to this “the Slavic language”. Then, in the Middle Bulgarian period, the name was gradually replaced by ”the Bulgarian language“.</p><p> When it comes to grammar and vocabulary, Bulgarian has several characteristics that set it apart from all other Slavic languages, the most notable being its almost complete loss of case declension in the noun and the development of a suffixed definite article. What does this mean? Well, the definite article is placed after the noun or adjective. For example, to say “table” in Bulgarian, you say_masa,_ and to say “the table” you say_masata_ . Additionally, the infinitive form of the verb is replaced with a clause, as in Romanian, modern Greek and Albanian.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=194977&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrfactory/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >Screensaver Factory, Create stunning professional screensavers within minutes.

The app offers instant immersion, feedback on pronunciation, suggestions that enrich learners’ vocabulary, and interactive scenarios that make learning languages fun and easy.</p><p>Check out this fun, short video:</p><p> Alex Iliescu, CEO of Mondly, spoke recently about why Mondly identified VR early-on as the future of language learning: “   <em>We realized the best way to teach languages would be to create an immersive experience that replicates real-life scenarios and conversations. VR gives us the best opportunity to do this.”</em></p><p>Alex continues   <em>“From our experience, the biggest things that keep people from actually speaking and using new languages are fear and lack of life-like practice. Mondly VR overcomes these barriers and quickly gets learners comfortable and speaking in real-life situations. We’re filling the conversational gap of traditional language education.</em> ”</p><p> Before Mondly VR, to experience language immersion – it typically required months of preparation, then travel. Today, it requires Mondly VR and a VR headset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MondlyVR-for-Daydream-Learn-languages-in-Virtual-Reality-1_2.gif"                      alt="MondlyVR for Daydream Learn languages in Virtual Reality 1 2" title="Mondly Launches The First Vr Language App With Speech Recognition On Daydream 2"                ></p><h2 id="Experts-agree-that-IMMERSION-is-the-best-way-to-learn-a-new-language"><a href="#Experts-agree-that-IMMERSION-is-the-best-way-to-learn-a-new-language" class="headerlink" title="Experts agree that IMMERSION is the best way to learn a new language"></a>Experts agree that IMMERSION is the best way to learn a new language</h2><p>In one <a class="link"   href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/science/how-immersion-helps-to-learn-a-new-language.html?mcubz=1" >study <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  , featured in the New York Times by Michael Ullman, a neuroscientist at Georgetown University Medical Center, language learning subjects were split into two groups. One group studied language in a formal classroom setting, while the other was taught through immersion. After five months, both groups retained the language.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Hungarian-Way-to-Declare-Your-Heart"><a href="#The-Hungarian-Way-to-Declare-Your-Heart" class="headerlink" title="The Hungarian Way to Declare Your Heart"></a>The Hungarian Way to Declare Your Heart</h2><p> First off, congratulations on building up the courage to confess your love. If you’re head over heels for a Hungarian native speaker, learning how to say_I love you_ in Hungarian is a good strategy to win their heart for good. After all, nothing says_I love you_ like <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-6939&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6939&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6939" >learning their language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Until then, enjoy the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >language barrier <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the fullest. While it can be challenging, it will also lead to some hilarious misunderstandings more often than not. And what spices up the romance if not humor?</p><h2 id="How-to-say-‘I-love-you’-in-Hungarian"><a href="#How-to-say-‘I-love-you’-in-Hungarian" class="headerlink" title="How to say ‘I love you’ in Hungarian"></a>How to say ‘I love you’ in Hungarian</h2><p> The word you are looking for if you want to say <strong><em>I love you</em> in Hungarian is_Szeretlek_</strong>  .</p><p> While English uses three different words – I love you –, Hungarian makes use of suffixes and gets it done in one word. Thus, the_<strong>-lek</strong>_ at the end accounts for “you.”</p><p> Besides, unlike other languages, Hungarian is a non-gendered language. This means you can say_Szeretlek_ to someone of either sex.</p><p> Supposing you want to find out if your feelings are reciprocated, you can ask_Te szeretsz engem?_ which means “Do you love me?”.</p><p> Last but not least, <strong>the word for “love” in Hungarian is_szeretet_ .</strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2201613&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.macdvdripperpro.com/images/devices-3.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Useful-Hungarian-words-and-phrases-for-lovebirds"><a href="#Useful-Hungarian-words-and-phrases-for-lovebirds" class="headerlink" title="Useful Hungarian words and phrases for lovebirds"></a>Useful Hungarian words and phrases for lovebirds</h2><p> While we’re at it, let’s also explore some useful Hungarian words and phrases related to romance and dating in general. You never know when they’ll come in handy.</p><ul><li><em>Belédszerettem.</em> – I’m falling in love with you.</li><li><em>Hiszel a szerelemben első látásra?</em> – Do you believe in love at first sight?</li><li><em>Kedvellek.</em> – I like you.</li><li><em>Nagyon kedvellek.</em> – I like you a lot.</li><li><em>Szeretnél eljönni velem ma este?</em> – Would you like to go out with me tonight?</li><li><em>Mit szólnál egy vacsorához és egy filmhez?</em> – How about dinner and a movie?</li><li><em>Megfoghatom a kezed?</em> – May I hold your hand?</li><li><em>Szeretnélek újra látni.</em> – I’d like to see you again.</li><li><em>Nagyon szép vagy.</em> – You are very beautiful.</li><li><em>Nagyon jóképű vagy.</em> – You are very handsome.</li><li><em>Megcsókolhatlak?</em> – May I kiss you?</li></ul><p> Easy as that! Now you do it and let us know how it went.

I can’t help but applaud your choice! Not many people choose to venture on this path. Having a little over 10 million speakers worldwide makes Czech the underdog (or one of the underdogs). Consequently, Czech courses are generally scarce. So if you are wondering what’s the easiest way to study <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-6512&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6512?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=cz&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6512?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=cz" >Czech <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> online, you’ve come to the right place.</p><h2 id="The-Czech-language-in-a-nutshell"><a href="#The-Czech-language-in-a-nutshell" class="headerlink" title="The Czech language in a nutshell"></a>The Czech language in a nutshell</h2><p> Czech (known as_Čeština_ to Czechs) is a West Slavic language closely related to Slovak, Polish, and the Sorbian <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >languages of eastern Germany <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It is spoken in the historical regions of Moravia, Bohemia, and in today’s Czech Republic, where it is also the official language.</p><p> Developed towards the end of the first millennium, the Czech language is written in the Roman (Latin) alphabet with some additional letters to the ones we use in English. These are_á, č, ď, é, ě, í, ň, ó, ř, š, ť, ú, ů, ý_ and_ž_ . Moreover, Czech is a fusional language which makes it highly inflective. This means that words in Czech may have very different endings depending on their grammatical category (such as tense, case, person, number, gender and so on).</p><p> To understand the extent of <a class="link"   href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Czech-language" >Czech <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> grammar, it’s useful to look at an overview. Czech has seven noun cases, two numbers, three persons in the verb, three tenses, and three moods. This may sound like a lot, but as soon as you start learning, it will all make sense.</p><p> The<strong>oldest records of the Czech language</strong> are glosses appearing in German and Latin texts in<strong>the 12th century.</strong> Thus it’s not a surprise to find out that the Czech vocabulary is extensively influenced by Latin and German.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920047/21774" target="_top" id="1920047"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920047"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920047/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Czech-–-the-most-common-language-spoken-at-home-in-the-US"><a href="#Czech-–-the-most-common-language-spoken-at-home-in-the-US" class="headerlink" title="Czech – the most common language spoken at home in the US?"></a>Czech – the most common language spoken at home in the US?</h3><p> A little-known fact about the Czech language is that it is very well represented in the United States. Czech people immigrated from Europe to the United States primarily from 1848 to 1914, so Czech became a <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less%5FCommonly%5FTaught%5FLanguages" >Less Commonly Taught Language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in U.S. schools and is nowadays taught at Czech heritage centers.</p><p> Furthermore, in the 2000 United States Census,<strong>Czech was reported as the most common language spoken at home</strong> <strong>(besides English)</strong> in three counties from Nebraska and one from Kansas.

This means that if you already know Slovak you will have an easier time learning Czech.</p><p> Czech and Slovak shared a common history long before the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 (a state which peacefully split in 1993), so it’s no surprise that literary Slovak is so similar to Czech. How similar though? Well, think of British English and American English then tone down the level a bit. We’re talking about slightly different vocabulary, false cognates, varied syntax, localized idioms, and different vocabulary and slang.

The answers lie in the learning process itself.</p><p>New language users typically pursue competency in the first 3-5 years it takes to learn a language. Then, we coast. We learn just enough English needed to achieve our goals.</p><p>Advanced learners don’t just pursue competency; they pursue <em>connection.</em></p><p>Nelson Mandela said:</p><blockquote><p>“If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.”</p></blockquote><p>Language learning, after all, is about more than just talking your mouth off. It’s about deep and authentic human connection, about relationships and making them stronger. Connection trumps competency. Connection is the ultimate sign of language excellence.</p><p>So how do we excel at connection? By becoming a lifelong learner of a language, no matter how good you already are at speaking it.</p><p>Anyone can become a lifelong learner, whether you’re in school or not, as long as you take learning seriously. Here are 5 powerful habits that all lifelong language learners should possess.</p><h2 id="1-Study-Body-Language"><a href="#1-Study-Body-Language" class="headerlink" title="1. Study Body Language"></a>1. Study Body Language</h2><blockquote><p>“Research indicates the pitch, volume, and pace of your voice affect what people think you said about FIVE TIMES as much as the actual words you used.” – Deborah Gruenfeld</p></blockquote><p>Body language focuses on visual cues used to express more information and emotion. Body language, however, also reveals what spoken language doesn’t: how you really feel.</p><p>Basic and intermediate language learners focus on the literal and exact words in conversation.</p><p>In personal or professional interactions, advanced students focus on the literal communication AND the visual. They learn to read the body language of others, and work to improve their own.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/DaNwD0SPavhF6/giphy.gif?cid=3640f6095c08f4ca7130495a6fa7153a"                      alt="giphy" title="How To Take Your English To The Next Level 2"                ></p><blockquote><p>“A conversation is so much more than words, a conversation is eyes, smiles, the silences between the words.” – Annika Thor</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="1080" height="1620" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:1080px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## 2\. Learn to Enjoy Wordplay<p>How completely, and how rapidly, do you get jokes, spot puns, and catch lyrical or cultural references? How well do you understand wordplay while reading, conversing, or listening to music?</p><p>For advanced English learners, even the subtlest wordplay clicks within seconds, sometimes tenths of a second. Music, movies, and comedy are full of pop culture references, famous quotes, sarcasm, and all kinds of literary devices planted to delight the few members in the audience who are paying close attention.</p><p>Beginner and intermediate level users have a tougher time grasping all the puns or even enjoying figurative language. The advanced language learner loves playing with words and numbers, and as a result, they think quicker on their own feet in many aspects.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Get-Outside-Your-Comfort-Zone"><a href="#3-Get-Outside-Your-Comfort-Zone" class="headerlink" title="3.

Get Outside Your Comfort Zone</h2><blockquote><p>“One good conversation can shift the direction of change forever.” – Linda Lam</p></blockquote><p>Most English speakers are capable of having full-blown conversations in private or in group settings within their inner circle, AKA the Comfort Zone. But what about speaking in front of a class or an office audience? What about impromptu conversations or polarizing debates with friends?</p><p>How well can you speak up and express yourself when stuck in a high-pressure situation?</p><p>Humans’ language skills tend to be weaker in these fight-or-flight situations, regardless of how articulate we are normally, so the question has to be asked: what are we doing to get better?</p><p>A true language expert has to practice a lot in order to learn to clearly express facts, opinions, and stories. It also takes a lot of practice to have the presence of mind to know when to be quiet, listen, and fully understand the other person.</p><p>Expanding your language comfort zone takes a lot of time and pain, and unless you’re naturally born this way, you can’t afford not to become natural at it.</p><p>Steal lessons on stretching your comfort zone from these masters of language:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theodysseyonline.com/public-speaking-lessons">Public speaking lessons revealed in Hasan Minhaj’s <em>The Homecoming King</em></a></li><li>_ <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Yes-Improvisation-Reverses-Creativity-Collaboration-Lessons/dp/0062248545" >Yes, And: How Improvisation Reverses “No, But” Thinking and Improves Creativity and Collaboration–Lessons from The Second City <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Excellence-Dividend-Meeting-Tech-Tide-ebook/dp/B074DHM8LH/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1533936817&sr=1-1&keywords=excellence+dividend" >The Excellence Dividend: Meeting the Tech Tide with Work That Wows and Jobs That Last <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40002162&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/1_Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF Perpetual (1 PC) Free upgrade. No monthly fees ever.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Embrace-Old-English"><a href="#4-Embrace-Old-English" class="headerlink" title="4.

It’s boring. It’s impossible to make sense of. It’s not how anyone talks any more, so it feels irrelevant. We can’t justify the time and frustration.</p><p>But where ordinary English users stop is where advanced learners get started. What we see as pointless, they see as opportunity – an opportunity to understand how our ancestors expressed thoughts and emotions, and viewed the world. An opportunity to understand the roots of language in human history. An opportunity to deeply appreciate older forms of art.</p><p>They identify the obstacles that make reading Old English so challenging, and come up with solutions, in order to get better. They stay calm and keep on reading until patterns start forming, one painful sentence after another, until literal and symbolic meanings become clear.</p><p>Want to take your language skills to the next level?

Lifelong learners, however, realize that all forms of primary language – visual, verbal, and written – have equal importance and benefits.</p><p>Throughout history and even today, communication and connection have been lopsided between hearing people and deaf people. Deaf people have to learn to read and write in English. They have to learn to read lips, on top of learning sign language. The more hearing people learn <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3HoC9_ir3s&feature=youtu.be" >basic sign language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the better we’ll all be able to understand one another.</p><p>Lifelong learners of language don’t just stop at 5 years.

Some of them would even want to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn German <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> but don’t do it because they find it too intimidating. And we can’t blame them. The internet is loaded with videos of people exaggerating the German pronunciation.</p><p> However, German pronunciation being difficult is just a myth.<em>Oh ja,</em> you read that right. German is actually one of the few languages where pronunciation makes sense. Once you know the rules, all you have to do is flex those pronunciation muscles and speak like a true German. It’s really not as hard as you think. Let’s break the myth together.</p><h2 id="The-basics-of-the-German-alphabet"><a href="#The-basics-of-the-German-alphabet" class="headerlink" title="The basics of the German alphabet"></a>The basics of the German alphabet</h2><p> We’ll naturally start with the basics. Much like English, the German alphabet consists of 26 standard letters. In addition to that, it also features the letter ß – known as the German ligature – and umlauted forms of three vowels: ä, ö and ü. In total,<em>das Alphabet</em> has 8 vowels and 22 consonants.</p><p> Considering you’re already familiar with all the other letters, let’s continue by taking a closer look at these four special letters: ß, ä, ö and ü.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4631056&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/997e65474a248252883b485717f7d098/products/buy-windows.png"                      border="0"                >Allavsoft Batch Download Online Videos, Music Offline to MP4, MP3, MOV, etc format </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="s-also-known-as-‘sharp-S’-‘eszett’-or-‘scharfes-S’"><a href="#s-also-known-as-‘sharp-S’-‘eszett’-or-‘scharfes-S’" class="headerlink" title="ß also known as ‘sharp S’, ‘eszett’ or ‘scharfes S’"></a>ß also known as ‘sharp S’, ‘eszett’ or ‘scharfes S’</h3><p> Although it looks different from everything you’ve ever seen in English, ß shouldn’t intimidate you. Vaguely resembling a capital ‘B’,<strong>the letter ß is pronounced like a sharp S</strong> (like the ‘s’ in ‘see’) – hence its name ‘eszett’ or ‘scharfes S’.</p><p> German is the only language that uses ß and if the character is unavailable, it can be replaced with ⟨ss⟩. In fact, in Swiss Standard German (used in Switzerland and Liechtenstein), the letter was completed replaced by ⟨ss⟩ sometime in the 20th century.</p><p> Eszett not having a capitalized version sparked debates for a long time, so the Council for German Orthography <a class="link"   href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/bildung/rechtschreibung-das-alphabet-bekommt-einen-neuen-buchstaben-1.3566309" >officially adopted <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> a capital in 2017. The capital of ß is ẞ.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4530091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/cit_win/banScrn.jpg"                      border="0"                >CollageIt Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="German-umlauts-a-o-u"><a href="#German-umlauts-a-o-u" class="headerlink" title="German umlauts: ä, ö, ü"></a>German umlauts: ä, ö, ü</h3><p> While highly representative for the German language, the German umlauts are ‘guilty’ of making the most uncommon sounds to English speakers.</p><p> To put it simply, the umlaut – represented by the two dots over a, o and u – indicates that an ‘hidden e’ will follow the vowel in pronunciation:</p><ul><li><strong>ä</strong> will be pronounced as <strong>‘ae’</strong> ;</li><li><strong>ö</strong> will be pronounced as <strong>‘oe’</strong> ;</li><li><strong>ü</strong> will be pronounced as <strong>‘ue’</strong> .</li></ul><p> To give you a better idea of the pronunciation, remember that ä somehow resembles the ‘ai’ sound in ‘air’ and ö is similar to the ‘e’ in ‘her’ or the famous French ‘eu’.

We’ll continue by just simply explaining how to pronounce single letters or certain letter combinations.</p><p> Sounds good? Let’s dive right in. Here’s how to pronounce the German letters that sound different from English:</p><ol><li><strong>R</strong> – Much like the notorious French <em>r</em> , the German <em>r</em> is one of the most distinctive sounds of the language. Many people describe its pronunciation like a gurgling sound. However, this is applicable only for the <em>R</em> s placed at the beginning of a word. Anywhere else, the <em>r</em>  sounds more like an ‘ah’ or ‘uh’. Now try to say <em>Radio</em> like a German.</li><li><strong>W</strong> – The German <em>w</em> sounds like the English ‘v’. Now you know <em>vy some Germans vill talk like zis.</em>  Try it yourself by saying <em>was?</em> (‘what?’).</li><li><strong>V</strong> – Sounds like the English ‘f’. This is why <em>Vater</em> sounds a lot like ‘father’.</li><li><strong>J</strong> – <em>Oh ja,</em> you already know this one! The German <em>j</em> is pronounced like the English ‘y’.</li><li><strong>E</strong> – If you see an <em>e</em> at the end of a German word, make sure to pronounce it like this: ‘eh’. Come on! Loud and clear: <em>Katze</em> (‘cat’)!</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097466/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097466"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097466"                      border="0" alt="" width="2048" height="1024"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097466/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="German-pronunciation-guide-for-letter-combinations"><a href="#German-pronunciation-guide-for-letter-combinations" class="headerlink" title="German pronunciation guide for letter combinations"></a>German pronunciation guide for letter combinations</h2><p> Just a few more examples and you’ll soon be ready to speak like a German! Let’s see how you should pronounce certain letter combinations in German:</p><ol><li><strong>CH</strong> – Don’t laugh, but this is best described as a cat-hissing sound. Now try saying <em>Ich</em> (‘I’) or <em>mich</em> (‘my’). However, don’t forget that the sound is usually softer after a consonant.</li><li><strong>EI</strong> – Sounds a lot like the English ‘eye’. Try it by saying <em>einladen</em> (‘to invite’).</li><li><strong>IE</strong>  – You should pronounce this one like a long ‘e’: <em>lieben</em> (‘to love’).</li><li><strong>PF</strong> – Make sure to quickly pronounce both letters as close together as possible. For example: <em>Pfeffer</em> (‘pepper’).</li><li><strong>SP&#x2F;ST</strong> – In both cases you should say <em>sh</em>  (exactly like the English ‘sh’) followed by <em>p</em> or <em>t</em> . Thus, <em>sp</em> will be pronounced <em>shp</em> and <em>st</em> will be pronounced <em>sht</em> . For example:<em>sprechen</em> (‘speak’) or Strauss as in musician Johann Strauss.</li><li><strong>KN</strong> – Although it may sound weird to you as an English speaker, make sure to pronounce both letters: <em>Knabe</em> (‘boy’ or ‘lad’).</li><li><strong>TH</strong> – Sounds like ‘t’. Practice by saying <em>Theorie</em> like this: TAY-oh-ree.</li><li><strong>TSCH</strong> – You already know this one because… <em>Deutsch</em> .

Most <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >German words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are, in fact, compounds.</p><p> So what exactly is a ‘compound’? When two words (or sometimes even more) are used together to create a new meaning, a compound is formed. In English, we use hyphens to make everything easier to read, but German just puts everything tight together.<em>Gute Arbeit, Deutsch!</em> (‘Nice work, German!’) For example,<em>unabhängigkeitserklärungen</em> translates to ‘declarations of independence’ and_nahrungsmittelunverträglichkeit_ may look impossible to remember or pronounce, but it actually means ‘food intolerance’.</p><p> Now, everything you have to do to successfully pronounce these long words is to mentally separate the compound word. Break up the very long word into shorter words and pronounce them using the rules you already know. You may sound funny in the beginning, but in time, it will get easier and easier to recognize and pronounce long German words.</p><p><em>Tschüss!</em></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/german-pronunciation-alphabet/&t=A+Beginner%E2%80%99s+Guide+to+the+German+Pronunciation+&+Alphabet"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h4 id="How-to-speak-like-a-German-fast"><a href="#How-to-speak-like-a-German-fast" class="headerlink" title="How to speak like a German fast"></a>How to speak like a German fast</h4><p> Do you want to speak German like a fluent speaker?

These are known as Old Latin, Classical Latin, Vulgar Latin (that also influenced the Romance languages), Medieval Latin, Renaissance Latin, New Latin and Contemporary Latin or the Latin we use today in the Catholic Church, in science, mottos, et cetera (“and so forth”).</p><p> Additionally,<strong>Latin has also highly influenced English</strong> through ecclesiastical usage and writers who borrowed words that we still use today.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/latin-language-600x450.jpg"                      alt="latin language" title="This Is The Easiest Way To Learn Latin Online 3"                ></p><p> “Hercules furens” by Seneca.</p><p><em>Ergo</em> , history makes Latin the backbone of many present-day languages and studying it could help you gain valuable insight into the infrastructure of many other languages.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a class="link"   href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4721564&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1" >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, 12-month subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Latin-grammar-and-the-Latin-alphabet"><a href="#Latin-grammar-and-the-Latin-alphabet" class="headerlink" title="Latin grammar and the Latin alphabet"></a>Latin grammar and the Latin alphabet</h2><p> The Latin alphabet that many languages use today evolved from the visually similar Etruscan alphabet, which – in turn – evolved from the Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician alphabet that derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. As a result of Etruscans ruling early Rome, over time, their alphabet developed into the Latin alphabet that many centuries later became the writing system we all know today.</p><p>A fascinating origin story, isn’t it?</p><p> With three distinct genders, up to seven noun cases, five declensions, four verb conjugations, six tenses, three persons, three moods, two voices, two or three aspects and two numbers, Latin grammar may seem complicated.

If you are not necessarily a_language aficionado_ who just loves to learn new languages, the Latin language might still be of interest to you. We already emphasized the main reasons to learn Latin, but here they are again plus a few more:</p><ul><li><p>Latin sits at the core of the Romance languages and has greatly influenced the vocabulary of many other languages including English. Ergo, learning Latin will help you master the overall structure and vocabulary of other languages as well.</p></li><li><p>Latin can prepare you for many professions or simply discussions with scholarly people. These fields include law, medicine, science, music, theology, philosophy, art, and literature.</p></li><li><p>Knowing Latin could help you enjoy some of the most influential literature in the world in their original language. Just imagine being able to read “The Aeneid” by Virgil, “Metamorphoses” by Ovid, “Selected Works” by Cicero or “The Conquest of Gaul” by Julius Caesar in Latin!</p></li><li><p>Many scholars believe that learning Latin also sharpens the mind, cultivating careful analysis and attention.</p></li><li><p>Additionally, deciphering the “secret code” of Latin, discovering the meanings behind words you already know from other languages and reading great authors in their original language is a pleasure that will last you a lifetime.</p></li><li><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/easiest-way-to-learn-latin-online/&t=This+Is+the+Easiest+Way+to+Learn+Latin+Online"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></li><li><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453720/17020" target="_top" id="1453720"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453720"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453720/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Start-learning-Latin-today"><a href="#Start-learning-Latin-today" class="headerlink" title="Start learning Latin today"></a>Start learning Latin today</h2><p> The Latin language is no longer is secret code meant only for scholars or the Catholic Church.

Mondly was and still is the only language learning app that offers this bespoke language alongside the typical mainstream languages like Italian, French and Spanish.</p><p> For the past five years, I’ve used Mondly to supplement my language learning. I joined when I started with Afrikaans, then used it to refresh my <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5047&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5047?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=fr&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5047?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=fr" >French <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and now I’m using it to <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5047&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5047?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=nb&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5047?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=nb" >learn Norwegian <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The best part is that with my lifetime membership, I can switch between these languages at any time plus access the rest of the range of language courses that Mondly has available.</p><p> Mondly keeps the learning process enjoyable. Having fun is essential to the language learning process because it helps you to push through when you hit a plateau, lose motivation, or begin tackling more challenging aspects of the language.</p><p> With that said, here are ten ways Mondly has improved my language learning and how it can do the same for you.</p><h2 id="1-Bite-sized-lessons-for-a-busy-lifestyle"><a href="#1-Bite-sized-lessons-for-a-busy-lifestyle" class="headerlink" title="1. Bite-sized lessons for a busy lifestyle"></a>1. Bite-sized lessons for a busy lifestyle</h2><p> Running my language and travel blog,<a class="link"   href="https://www.theintrepidguide.com/" >The Intrepid Guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , is a full-time job and I quickly lose track of time, especially when I’m in the zone writing a new language article or editing a new trip. When you have a busy lifestyle, it’s easy to fall off the language learning wagon or stick to a routine. What I love about Mondly is that I can spend as little or as long as I like learning my target language. Each lesson takes no more than 5 minutes to complete which makes it easy to slip into my day. I don’t have to stress about how I’m going to keep on track with my language goals because Mondly keeps each lesson short and sweet.</p><p> I like to kick off my day by doing something productive and positive for myself, so I’ll start by completing my daily lesson. Once I start, I don’t want to stop! So, depending on how much I’ve got on for that day, I’ll complete another 1 or 2 lessons.</p><p> To help me create and maintain this new morning habit, I use the <strong>“Learning Reminder” feature</strong>  to pick a time of day when I want to receive an alert. This gentle reminder pops up on my phone reminding me to complete my daily lesson.</p><h2 id="2-A-variety-of-languages-for-a-lifetime-of-learning"><a href="#2-A-variety-of-languages-for-a-lifetime-of-learning" class="headerlink" title="2. A variety of languages for a lifetime of learning"></a><strong>2. A variety of languages for a lifetime of learning</strong></h2><p> As I mentioned earlier, I first used Mondly when I started learning Afrikaans. Variety really is the spice of life and Mondly definitely helped me stay on track with my Afrikaans language goals. Afrikaans grammar books and general learning material was and still is extremely limited. So, I really appreciated the fact that Mondly offers such a bespoke language. Besides, I think that Mondly is a unique language learning tool that grows at the same time as you, the learner.</p><p> As my language goals changed, Mondly has been there to support me and offer a Norwegian course. When I was worried about my French getting rusty, Mondly was there to help me revise it.</p><p> Additionally, if you want to learn English, you can choose between American or British English, which I think is fantastic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/mondly-app-600x446.jpg"                      alt="mondly language learning" title="10 Ways Mondly Has Improved My Language Learning 2"                ></p><p> Screenshots from the Mondly app</p><h2 id="3-Using-the-laddering-technique-to-learn-multiple-languages"><a href="#3-Using-the-laddering-technique-to-learn-multiple-languages" class="headerlink" title="3. Using the laddering technique to learn multiple languages"></a>3. Using the laddering technique to learn multiple languages</h2><p> Not only does Mondly support 33 languages, it even allows you to choose any of those 33 languages as a basis to learn your target language. For example, to practice my French while learning Norwegian, I can set my “native language” to French and set my target language to Norwegian. This is known as_laddering_ – where you use a non-native language to learn another. It’s like killing two birds with one stone. It’s a fun and efficient use of my limited study time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296985&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9cea886b9f44a3c2df1163730ab64994/products/copy_nero_burning_rom_cart.png"                      border="0"                ><br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Context-based-learning"><a href="#4-Context-based-learning" class="headerlink" title="4. Context-based learning"></a>4. Context-based learning</h2><p> I mainly use Mondly to improve my vocabulary and expose myself to new words and the learning process is indeed great! First, you learn the new word on its own, and then you learn how to use it in the context of a sentence. For example, today, I learned the word <em>sommerfugl</em>  (Norwegian for “butterfly”). Then, after a few exercises, I already knew phrases such as <em>sommerfuglen er pen</em>  (“the butterfly is pretty”).</p><p> To make sure the new words are perfectly glued inside my brain, Mondly does another thing. Not only does it allow me to learn how to use them in practical contexts, but it also continues by showing me new adjectives that will further cement my knowledge.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BConverter%2BBox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/8020c1dc-518e-3bdf-6e7b-e6d1bdf1597b.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Using-the-chatbot-to-improve-my-pronunciation"><a href="#5-Using-the-chatbot-to-improve-my-pronunciation" class="headerlink" title="5. Using the chatbot to improve my pronunciation"></a>5. Using the chatbot to improve my pronunciation</h2><p> When you do a lot of self-study, speaking practice and improving pronunciation are either forgotten or receive very little attention. To ensure I’m getting a well-rounded learning experience, I use the Mondly chatbot tool, where I can simulate an audio-based conversation with a fluent speaker. I listen to the fluent speaker, then record my own voice in response.</p><p> In other language learning apps, once you submit your recording, there is no playback. Meaning you can’t replay what you’ve said and hear how you sound. With Mondly, I can. So, I listen back to what I’ve said and compare it to the fluent speaker and see where I need to improve. This is such a handy feature that aids an essential part of my progress.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BScreen%2BRecorder%2Bbox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/f026b149-fc7c-fd54-5f3e-1460bbb19b6b.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Gamification-that-isn’t-intrusive"><a href="#6-Gamification-that-isn’t-intrusive" class="headerlink" title="6. Gamification that isn’t intrusive"></a>6. Gamification that isn’t intrusive</h2><p> Gamification is huge when it comes to language learning apps, but having experimented with a few leading apps, I found that they were too gamified and too competitive. There weren’t just leaderboards, but entire pages of statistics based on how many lessons you completed in a certain period of time. Now, a little friendly competition can be a great motivator, but at some point it can quickly become more about winning and less about learning.</p><p> <strong>Learning a language isn’t a race; there is no finish line. Language learning is a journey, a journey that should be enjoyed free from stress.</strong>  As soon as you compare yourself to others and how much or little they are doing or how fast they are progressing that can be stressful.</p><p> Mondly strikes a nice balance between providing entertainment through gamification but also keeping me accountable and on track with just the right amount of exposure to different leaderboards. There is an entirely separate tab to access leaderboards so I can ignore it completely if I don’t want to compare myself with anyone else, which can be very tempting but neither healthy nor helpful.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/mondly-app-screenshots-600x446.jpg"                      alt="mondly language learning" title="10 Ways Mondly Has Improved My Language Learning 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633281&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/2_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Monthly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Screenshots from the Mondly app</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657397/16446" target="_top" id="1657397"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657397"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657397/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Travel-themed-and-travel-focused"><a href="#7-Travel-themed-and-travel-focused" class="headerlink" title="7. Travel-themed and travel-focused"></a>7. Travel-themed and travel-focused</h2><p> As a traveler who enjoys learning the local language before a trip, I love that Mondly supports both my long-term and short-term language goals. Mondly is currently helping me with my long-term goal of learning Norwegian, where I access verb conjugates and grammar explanations, but when I have a trip somewhere like Spain, Vietnam, or the Netherlands, it also supports my short-term language goals. This is where I use Mondly to learn essential travel phrases and vocabulary I’ll need for my trip. I can easily do this just by skipping to those modules directly. I don’t need to start from scratch and work my way up.</p><p> Mondly has a lovely travel-themed user interface too that highlights famous monuments around the world. This acts as a subtle reminder of how useful and essential languages are when it comes to travel. This is something I feel strongly about and talk about a lot over at The Intrepid Guide.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296740&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/biu/Nero_BackItUp_Screen_2.webp"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Summary-after-each-lesson"><a href="#8-Summary-after-each-lesson" class="headerlink" title="8. Summary after each lesson"></a>8. Summary after each lesson</h2><p> <strong>What I like most about Mondly is the small touches that all add up and make such a difference.</strong>  It might sound trivial, but I find it so helpful that after each lesson it gives you a summary of what was covered. This allows me to easily transfer new words into my Google Doc, where I keep all my language notes. Having a lesson summary means I don’t have to stop during a lesson to record what I’m learning. I then put these words into a flashcard app to revise them later.</p><h2 id="9-Convenient-and-flexible"><a href="#9-Convenient-and-flexible" class="headerlink" title="9. Convenient and flexible"></a>9. Convenient and flexible</h2><p> When you start with a new language learning app or tool, usually you have to either pass a test before you can access lessons that are appropriate for your level or, in most cases, you’re forced to start from scratch. This can be incredibly annoying, not to mention a waste of time. Mondly is great because it allows you to choose from beginner, intermediate and advanced content. So, when I was brushing up on my French, I set it to advanced and for Norwegian set it to intermediate.</p><p> Mondly is available across different platforms too, so you can learn on-the-go using your smartphone or tablet with their Android or iOS app or use your desktop or laptop if you prefer working on a bigger screen.</p><h2 id="10-One-time-payment-for-a-lifetime-of-learning"><a href="#10-One-time-payment-for-a-lifetime-of-learning" class="headerlink" title="10. One time payment for a lifetime of learning"></a>10. One time payment for a lifetime of learning</h2><p> As the world moves more and more towards subscription-based services, I was grateful that Mondly offers you the flexibility to pay a one-time fee that gives you lifetime access to 41 languages, updates and all future updates. Compared to other language services, this is a huge saving and the most cost-efficient offering I’ve found on the market.</p><p> If your budget is limited, Mondly’s Lifetime Membership definitely pays dividends on its relatively small initial investment.</p><hr><p><strong>Author Bio:</strong>   <em>Michele is an Australian language and travel blogger and“the guide“ behind The Intrepid Guide.

The same, but different. But how different after all? Bernard Shaw, Irish playwright and political activist, famously said that The United States and Great Britain are<strong>“two countries divided by a common language”</strong> . Still, Brits and Americans always had this ongoing “fight” about “which English is best?” or “who speaks proper English?”. This is, of course, a joke_(or is it? hehe)_ . After all, British English and American English are not entirely different languages.</p><p> As someone <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5309&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5309&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5309" >speaking British English <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you’ll probably have (close to) no problem understanding American English and vice versa. But there are indeed rather important questions about the existing differences between the two “languages”. How did the same language develop in such a different way? Why do we spell some words differently? <strong>“Soccer”&#x2F;“football”, “sweater”&#x2F;“jumper”, “sneakers”&#x2F;“trainers”, “eraser”&#x2F;“rubber”, “mail&#x2F;post”</strong> are just a few of the troubling duos that first come to mind.</p><p> Before we go on… you’ve just realized, didn’t you? <strong>The “sweater weather” is actually the “jumper weather” or the “pullover weather” in the UK.</strong> Oh my God, this can’t be right, is it?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/SqmkZ5IdwzTP2/giphy.gif"                      alt="British vs American" title="British English Vs American English Differences: Spelling, Pronunciation And More 2"                ></p><h2 id="The-English-language-in-the-Americas"><a href="#The-English-language-in-the-Americas" class="headerlink" title="The English language in the Americas"></a>The English language in the Americas</h2><p> Before diving into the most important differences between <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >British English <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and American English, let’s put some historical context around the matter.</p><p> As you probably already know,<a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5309&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5309&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5309" >the English language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was first introduced to the Americas in the 16th and 17th centuries by the British colonists. Over the next 400 years, the English used in the region we now know as the United States welcomed some changes. However, these were not standardized until 1828, when Noah Webster published <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster%27s%5FDictionary" >the first American dictionary <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Allegedly, he changed the spelling of some words to make American English different from British English as a way of showing cultural independence.</p><p> Differences between American English and British English may be observed in pronunciation (Brits soften the pronunciation of the “R” sound while Americans <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >pronounce <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it completely), vocabulary, grammar, spelling, punctuation, and even idioms. Additionally, Americans also chose to use different formatting for dates and numbers.</p><p> Let’s dive into a little more detail and analyze each point of differentiation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033095&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced-3YR.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="British-vs-American-most-common-vocabulary-differences"><a href="#British-vs-American-most-common-vocabulary-differences" class="headerlink" title="British vs American: most common vocabulary differences"></a>British vs American: most common vocabulary differences</h2><p> Although the accent represents the most noticeable difference between British and American English, there are also words that differ completely depending on whether you are in Europe or across the Atlantic ocean. For example, as already mentioned, what Americans call a “sweater” is known as “jumper” or “pullover” in the United Kingdom. In the same fashion, what is known as football across the European continent Americans call soccer.</p><p> And that’s not everything. There’s actually a very <a class="link"   href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/soccer-not-football-%5Fn%5F5492714#:~:text=The%20word%20%E2%80%9Csoccer%2C%E2%80%9D%20which,colloquialisms%20to%20distinguish%20each%20game." >interesting story <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> behind the use of “football” and “soccer”. Although<strong>the term “soccer” was born in Britain some 200 years ago</strong> , Americans began using it to distinguish European football from American football. Then, in the ‘80, Brits began using “soccer” less and less because it had become too “American”.</p><p> Here are the most important vocabulary differences between British and American English:</p><p> Show 10 25 50 100  entries</p><p> Search:</p><table><thead><tr><th>British English</th><th>American English</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>trainers</td><td>sneakers</td></tr><tr><td>trousers</td><td>pants</td></tr><tr><td>flat</td><td>apartment</td></tr><tr><td>jumper&#x2F;pullover</td><td>sweater</td></tr><tr><td>braces</td><td>suspenders</td></tr><tr><td>bonnet</td><td>hood</td></tr><tr><td>boot</td><td>trunk</td></tr><tr><td>waistcoat</td><td>vest</td></tr><tr><td>university</td><td>college</td></tr><tr><td>holiday</td><td>vacation</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Showing 1 to 10 of 40 entries</p><p> Previous  Next</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BConverter%2BBox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/8020c1dc-518e-3bdf-6e7b-e6d1bdf1597b.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Spellings-differences-is-it-“colour”-or-“color”"><a href="#Spellings-differences-is-it-“colour”-or-“color”" class="headerlink" title="Spellings differences: is it “colour” or “color”?"></a>Spellings differences: is it “colour” or “color”?</h2><p> That’s simple! “Colour” is the British spelling and “color” is the American spelling. Always remember that, when it comes to spelling, American English uses a simplified version. The explanation goes back to 1828 when Noah Webster wrote the first American dictionary –<em>An American Dictionary of the English Language.</em> Webster said he chose alternative spellings that were already in use in the United States “on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology”.</p><p> Here are the most common spelling differences between American and British English:</p><p> Show 10 25 50 100  entries</p><p> Search:</p><table><thead><tr><th>British English</th><th>American English</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>-ise</strong> (familiarise, recognise)</td><td><strong>-ize</strong> (familiarize, recognize)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>-ou</strong> (colour, humour)</td><td><strong>-o</strong> (color, humor)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>-re</strong> (metre, theatre)</td><td><strong>-re</strong> (meter, theater)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>-l-</strong> (skilful, fulfil)</td><td><strong>-ll-</strong> (skillfull, fulfill)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>-oe-&#x2F;-ae-</strong> (oestrogen, encyclopaedia)</td><td><strong>-e-</strong> (estrogen, encyclopedia)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>-ence</strong> (offence, pretence)</td><td><strong>-ense</strong> (offense, pretense)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>-ogue</strong> (analogue, catalogue)</td><td><strong>-og</strong> (analog, catalog)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>-ell-</strong> (cancelled, marvellous)</td><td><strong>-el-</strong> (canceled, marvelous)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>-y-</strong> (tyre)</td><td><strong>-i-</strong> (tire)</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Showing 1 to 9 of 9 entries</p><p> Previous  Next</p><p> If you speak English as a second language and you are not sure which is the correct spelling for the type of English you use, install a spell checker and let it do the job for you.

In contrast, British English considers collective nouns either singular or plural, but more often plural as a way to emphasize the members of the group.</p><p> Thus, while<strong>“The band is playing”</strong> in the US, in the UK<strong>“The band are playing”</strong> . Likewise, if I’m in the US,<strong>“My team is winning”</strong> . But if I’m in the UK,<strong>“My team are winning”</strong> .</p><h3 id="Learned-or-learnt"><a href="#Learned-or-learnt" class="headerlink" title="Learned or learnt?"></a>Learned or learnt?</h3><p><strong>Learned</strong> and<strong>learnt</strong> are both the correct past participle and past tense forms of the verb “to learn”. Easily overlooked in speech, but much more obvious in writing, this subtle difference addresses verbs.</p><p> Many verbs that are irregular in the past tense in British English (<em>dreamt, burnt, learnt</em>), have been made regular in American English (<em>dreamed, burned, learned</em>).</p><h3 id="Got-or-gotten"><a href="#Got-or-gotten" class="headerlink" title="Got or gotten?"></a>Got or gotten?</h3><p> In the UK, the past participle of “get” – “gotten” – is considered archaic and was replaced with “got” some time ago. Americans, on the other hand, still use “gotten” as the past participle of “get”.</p><p><strong>British English:</strong> get – got – got</p><p><strong>American English:</strong> get – got – gotten</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tenses"><a href="#Tenses" class="headerlink" title="Tenses"></a>Tenses</h3><p> While Brits tend to use the present perfect tense to describe something that has recently occurred, Americans usually go with the past simple tense.</p><p> Thus, in Britain, you’ll say<strong>“I’ve been to the supermarket”</strong> and in the US you’ll say<strong>“I went to the supermarket”</strong> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BSysTools%2BPDF%2BUnlocker"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/pdf-unlocker.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Prepositions"><a href="#Prepositions" class="headerlink" title="Prepositions"></a>Prepositions</h3><p> In British English, “at” is generally used in relation to time and place.

For instance, Brits will use “shall” where Americans use “will” or “should”.</p><p> Additionally, in Britain, you are likely to hear “needn’t” a lot and in the US not at all. In its place, Americans use “don’t need to”.</p><h2 id="British-accent-vs-American-accent"><a href="#British-accent-vs-American-accent" class="headerlink" title="British accent vs American accent"></a>British accent vs American accent</h2><p> The biggest difference between British English and American English is, undoubtedly, the accent. The reason why these two variations sound so different is known as rhotacism, the change of a particular consonant into a rhotic consonant. In this case, the consonant is “r”.</p><p> American accent is rhotic and Americans pronounce their “R’s” loud and clear. On the other hand, the British accent is non-rhotic and Brits usually replace their “R’s” with “H’s”. Thus, words like “water” or “card” will be pronounced_wa-tuh_ or_caahd_ .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-spreadsheet-free-excel-editor-online-offline-1x.93e269d.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="British-vs-American-which-one-should-you-learn-and-use"><a href="#British-vs-American-which-one-should-you-learn-and-use" class="headerlink" title="British vs American: which one should you learn and use?"></a>British vs American: which one should you learn and use?</h2><p> It doesn’t matter whether you learn British English or American English. There is no such thing as “the best English”. Learn whichever you feel and like. Of course, if you intend to move to the United States, it is best to study and get used to the American accent.</p><p> The most important thing you should remember is to be consistent. Once you decide to go with British English, go with British all the way through. Avoid mixing them up. And work hard on your desired <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >English pronunciation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Then again, the truth is that these two English variants are very much alike. In fact, the written forms of American and British English you’ll find in textbooks and newspapers vary quite little in their essential features. Besides, even if they don’t like to admit it, American English has influenced British English via pop culture, and vice versa. It is what it is.</p><p> We haven’t discussed at all the funnier brother of these two variants: Australian English.

Everywhere in the neighborhood smells like pumpkin pie, roasted chestnuts and mulled wine. Everyone is wearing warmer clothes and brighter smiles. Kids are carrying their heavy schoolbags back home to a delicious lunch and scary jack-o’-lanterns have begun popping up here and there. It’s glaringly obvious:<strong>Halloween is almost here!</strong> Soon enough houses will be covered in black and orange decorations and children will shout excitedly:<strong>“Trick or treat?! Give me something good to eat!”.</strong></p><h2 id="The-Origins-of-Halloween"><a href="#The-Origins-of-Halloween" class="headerlink" title="The Origins of Halloween"></a>The Origins of Halloween</h2><p> Celebrated yearly on October 31, Halloween, Hallowe’en or All Hallows’ Eve is a world-old holiday whose origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain that took place on the lands that are now Ireland, the United Kingdom, and northern France. For hundreds – or even thousands – of years, people have celebrated this holiday, but it was never as loved and as notorious as it is today.</p><p> Nevertheless, there are many countries around the world that have their own Halloween-like traditions celebrating the afterlife. For example, in some parts of the world, on All Hallows’ Eve, people visit the graveyards of their loved ones to pray and place flowers. But let’s dive in already and look at <strong>four of the most fascinating Halloween-like traditions from different corners of the world.</strong></p><h2 id="Halloween-like-Traditions-Worldwide"><a href="#Halloween-like-Traditions-Worldwide" class="headerlink" title="Halloween-like Traditions Worldwide"></a>Halloween-like Traditions Worldwide</h2><h3 id="Mexico-Dia-de-Muertos-Day-of-the-Dead"><a href="#Mexico-Dia-de-Muertos-Day-of-the-Dead" class="headerlink" title="Mexico: Día de Muertos (Day of the Dead)"></a>Mexico: Día de Muertos (Day of the Dead)</h3><p> Inscribed in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity,<em>Día de los Muertos</em> is celebrated yearly on October 31, November 1, and November 2 to coincide with the celebration the Allhallowtide: All Saints’ Eve, All Saints’ Day, and All Souls’ Day.</p><p> The same as Halloween,<em>Día de Muertos</em> is a celebration of the afterlife. Friends and family gather to remember and pray for their loved ones who have died. Mexicans view death as a natural part of the human cycle and praying for someone who has died as a way of helping them in their spiritual journey. So Día de Muertos is not a day of sadness, but one of celebration and color!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/dia-de-muertos-960x639.jpg"                      alt="Colorful ofrendas and calaveras during Día de Muertos in Mexico" title="Global Halloween Celebrations: From Día De Muertos To Romania&#39;S St. Andrew&#39;S Day 6"                ></p><p> “Calaveras” by Valeria Almaraz©</p><p> As you probably already know, the main symbols of <a href="https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/indigenous-festivity-dedicated-to-the-dead-00054"><em>Día de Muertos</em></a> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofrenda"><em>ofrendas</em></a> (altars),<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calavera"><em>calaveras</em></a> (representations of a human skull often applied to edible or decorative skulls) and people wearing the colorful_calaveras_ makeup known all over the world.

For example, Italy has_Tutti i Morti,_ a public day celebrated on the 1st and 2nd of November by remembering and praying for the deceased.</p><p> A few days before the celebration, people visit the cemeteries so their loved ones will have fresh flowers on the grave on the day of the actual ceremonies. Then, they continue with all the other preparations involving different rituals depending on the region. For <a class="link"   href="https://www.italyheritage.com/traditions/calendar/november/ognissanti.htm" >example <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , in Puglia, Orsara, it is believed that the souls return from Purgatory, so the Orsaresi decorate the town with_cocce priatorje_ (pumpkins) that symbolize the spirits and lit bonfires to console them. In Sicily, children wake up on the morning of_Giorno dei Morti_ and find small gifts from their deceased relatives, in Abruzzo, children go door to door to ask for gifts for the souls of the dead and in Veneto, the carved pumpkins are called lumère (lanterns) or_suche dei morti_ (deads’ pumpkins) and represent the resurrection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/neonbrand-A59lWOrZVnw-unsplash-1024x682.jpg"                      alt="halloween in different countries" title="Global Halloween Celebrations: From Día De Muertos To Romania&#39;S St. Andrew&#39;S Day 8"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087264/19272" target="_top" id="2087264"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087264"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087264/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> “Halloween party” by NeONBRAND©</p><p> Contrary to what you may believe, pumpkins and asking for candy and gifts are traditions of the past that were popular in many Italian regions before the American Halloween became so notorious.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37540879&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://paperscan.orpalis.com/img/content/You_prefer_to_use.png"                      border="0"                >PaperScan Professional： PaperScan Scanner Software is a powerful TWAIN &amp; WIA scanning application centered on one idea: making document acquisition an unparalleled easy task for anyone.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Romania-Saint-Andrew’s-Day"><a href="#Romania-Saint-Andrew’s-Day" class="headerlink" title="Romania: Saint Andrew’s Day"></a>Romania: Saint Andrew’s Day</h3><p> Thanks to Dracula, Romania is now one of the most well-known Halloween destinations.

Instead, they advocate for the celebrations of the Day of the Dead on 1 November, when special religious ceremonies are held for the souls of the deceased.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/draculas-castle-1024x682.jpg"                      alt="dracula&#39;s castle" title="Global Halloween Celebrations: From Día De Muertos To Romania&#39;S St. Andrew&#39;S Day 9"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851691&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> “Dracula’s Castle in Romania” by Nomadic Julien©</p><p> It is said that on St. Andrew’s Eve, ghosts roam freely between the living and people must protect their homes using garlic, a symbol that is now also related to scaring off vampires. Thus, to this day, especially old people from the countryside, rub the doors and the windows with garlic to keep the bad spirits away.</p><p><strong>Did You Know?</strong></p><p> <em>Saint Andrew, for whom this day is named, is also the patron saint of Romania, Greece, and Russia. Each country has distinct customs and traditions to honor him.</em></p><p> The same as in other cultures, Romanians bring fresh flowers to the graves of their loved ones, go to the church to attend special ceremonies and offer food and drinks as it is believed the deceased can enjoy them in “The Other World”.</p><p> As October comes to an end, it’s evident that the spirit of Halloween, or the remembrance of the departed, resonates across cultures. While the customs might vary, the core sentiment remains consistent: honoring those who’ve passed and celebrating the mysteries of the afterlife</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/halloween-around-the-world/&t=Global+Halloween+Celebrations:+From+D%C3%ADa+de+Muertos+to+Romania%5C&%23039;s+St.+Andrew%5C&%23039;s+Day"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h4 id="Learn-a-new-language-and-celebrate-Halloween-abroad-this-year"><a href="#Learn-a-new-language-and-celebrate-Halloween-abroad-this-year" class="headerlink" title="Learn a new language and celebrate Halloween abroad this year"></a>Learn a new language and celebrate Halloween abroad this year</h4><p> Do you want to experience the magic of Halloween abroad?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Global-English-Variants-Unveiling-American-Irish-and-Indian-Tones"><a href="#Global-English-Variants-Unveiling-American-Irish-and-Indian-Tones" class="headerlink" title="Global English Variants: Unveiling American, Irish, and Indian Tones"></a>Global English Variants: Unveiling American, Irish, and Indian Tones</h2><p> One language, over one billion speakers, and countless ways to speak it. You guessed it. We’re talking about the fascinating <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5512&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5512&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5512" >English language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . So the big question is: with so many speakers, how many English accents are there?</p><p> Well, somewhere over<strong>40 english accents in the United Kingdom</strong> , but worldwide we can’t know for sure. As the saying goes “so many countries, so many customs”, so it’s fairly difficult to point the finger at one number. Maybe even you have your own English accent. But that doesn’t stop us from putting together a list of the most notable English accents of the worl…<em>uhm,</em> universe. From <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >British to American <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and even Aussie accent, let’s make the<strong>English accents</strong> inventory and find out how many ways of speaking English are there (at least roughly).</p><h2 id="What-is-an-accent"><a href="#What-is-an-accent" class="headerlink" title="What is an accent?"></a>What is an accent?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/accent" >Lexico <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> explains that an accent is “a distinctive way of pronouncing a language, especially one associated with a particular country, area, or social class”. Interesting, isn’t it? That is why you and maybe some of your friends in a particular area can create a new<strong>English accent</strong> of your own.</p><p> But chances are that one’s already used. As you probably already know, England isn’t short on accents. Travel north to south and it’ll give you the impression locals are speaking a whole new language.</p><p> Before moving to our actual introduction to various <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional%5Faccents%5Fof%5FEnglish#North%5FAmerica" >English accents and dialects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , take a few moments to think about which one is your favorite? Have you always dreamed of speaking English like the Queen of the United Kingdom? Or maybe like rugged Mr. Jamie Fraser from Outlander? Or are you a more American-oriented person and would go for a Matthew McConaughey-Texan style accent? So many fascinating choices!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/26BRCiSRp6d8j86rK/giphy.gif"                      alt="english acceents" title="English Accents: From Queen’s English To Aussie 9"                ></p><h2 id="British-Accent"><a href="#British-Accent" class="headerlink" title="British Accent"></a>British Accent</h2><p> Oh, the Brits! Judging by the<strong>British English</strong> accent you think they use, they are so royal, so sophisticated – or as they would presumably say – so_posh_ . But in reality, things are not entirely so. As we already hinted, the UK is incredibly rich in accents. Not everybody speaks British English like Benedict Cumberbatch or Martin Freeman. No, sir. A single British accent does not exist.</p><p> Lucky for you, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.bl.uk/british-accents-and-dialects/collection-items?view=list" >British Library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an incredible resource for people such as yourself who are interested in English accents and dialects. Here you’ll be able to search by country or by the map and even listen to how Britons speak all over the country. After just a quick search, I found no less than 77 audios of speakers from across the UK, chosen to represent different accents and dialects in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. That’s pure gold,<em>lad</em> ! Enjoy!</p><p> Let’s get down to work and review some of the most notable <a class="link"   href="https://oxfordhousebcn.com/en/a-brief-guide-to-different-british-accents-and-dialects/" >British accents <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you need to know from the British Isles and Ireland.</p><h3 id="Received-Pronunciation-or-Queen’s-English"><a href="#Received-Pronunciation-or-Queen’s-English" class="headerlink" title="Received Pronunciation or Queen’s English"></a>Received Pronunciation or Queen’s English</h3><p> If you are not a Brit but tried to put on a<strong>British accent</strong> at some point, the RP accent is most certainly what you were going for. Also known as the Queen’s&#x2F;Kings’s English or Oxford English, RP is the closest you can get to a “standard accent” in the UK.</p><p> The most important features of Received Pronunciation are non-rhoticity – meaning that the “r” at the end of the word isn’t pronounced and “mother” will sound like “muhthuh” – and trap-bath split. In broad terms, this means that certain words like “chance”, “bath”, “can’t”, and “dance” are pronounced with the long A as in “father”.</p><p> To hear RP in action, watch a lot of BBC or travel to Oxford, Cambridge, or Brighton and chat with the locals.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/british-accent-960x640.jpg"                      alt="british accent" title="English Accents: From Queen’s English To Aussie 10"                ></p><p> “All things British” by Aron Van de Pol©</p><p> Additionally, there’s even a heightened version of RP which is only really spoken in television or film. Think of Downton Abbey for reference.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633309&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/3_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features for 12 months.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Yearly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Cockney-Accent"><a href="#Cockney-Accent" class="headerlink" title="Cockney Accent"></a>Cockney Accent</h3><p> Cockney is perhaps the second most famous British English accent after RP.

You guessed it. We’re talking about the fascinating <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5512&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5512&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5512" >English language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . So the big question is: with so many speakers, how many English accents are there?</p><p> Well, somewhere over<strong>40 english accents in the United Kingdom</strong> , but worldwide we can’t know for sure. As the saying goes “so many countries, so many customs”, so it’s fairly difficult to point the finger at one number. Maybe even you have your own English accent. But that doesn’t stop us from putting together a list of the most notable English accents of the worl…<em>uhm,</em> universe. From <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >British to American <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and even Aussie accent, let’s make the<strong>English accents</strong> inventory and find out how many ways of speaking English are there (at least roughly).</p><h2 id="What-is-an-accent"><a href="#What-is-an-accent" class="headerlink" title="What is an accent?"></a>What is an accent?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/accent" >Lexico <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> explains that an accent is “a distinctive way of pronouncing a language, especially one associated with a particular country, area, or social class”. Interesting, isn’t it? That is why you and maybe some of your friends in a particular area can create a new<strong>English accent</strong> of your own.</p><p> But chances are that one’s already used. As you probably already know, England isn’t short on accents. Travel north to south and it’ll give you the impression locals are speaking a whole new language.</p><p> Before moving to our actual introduction to various <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional%5Faccents%5Fof%5FEnglish#North%5FAmerica" >English accents and dialects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , take a few moments to think about which one is your favorite? Have you always dreamed of speaking English like the Queen of the United Kingdom? Or maybe like rugged Mr. Jamie Fraser from Outlander? Or are you a more American-oriented person and would go for a Matthew McConaughey-Texan style accent? So many fascinating choices!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/26BRCiSRp6d8j86rK/giphy.gif"                      alt="english acceents" title="English Accents: From Queen’s English To Aussie 9"                ></p><h2 id="British-Accent"><a href="#British-Accent" class="headerlink" title="British Accent"></a>British Accent</h2><p> Oh, the Brits! Judging by the<strong>British English</strong> accent you think they use, they are so royal, so sophisticated – or as they would presumably say – so_posh_ . But in reality, things are not entirely so. As we already hinted, the UK is incredibly rich in accents. Not everybody speaks British English like Benedict Cumberbatch or Martin Freeman. No, sir. A single British accent does not exist.</p><p> Lucky for you, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.bl.uk/british-accents-and-dialects/collection-items?view=list" >British Library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an incredible resource for people such as yourself who are interested in English accents and dialects. Here you’ll be able to search by country or by the map and even listen to how Britons speak all over the country. After just a quick search, I found no less than 77 audios of speakers from across the UK, chosen to represent different accents and dialects in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. That’s pure gold,<em>lad</em> ! Enjoy!</p><p> Let’s get down to work and review some of the most notable <a class="link"   href="https://oxfordhousebcn.com/en/a-brief-guide-to-different-british-accents-and-dialects/" >British accents <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you need to know from the British Isles and Ireland.</p><h3 id="Received-Pronunciation-or-Queen’s-English"><a href="#Received-Pronunciation-or-Queen’s-English" class="headerlink" title="Received Pronunciation or Queen’s English"></a>Received Pronunciation or Queen’s English</h3><p> If you are not a Brit but tried to put on a<strong>British accent</strong> at some point, the RP accent is most certainly what you were going for. Also known as the Queen’s&#x2F;Kings’s English or Oxford English, RP is the closest you can get to a “standard accent” in the UK.</p><p> The most important features of Received Pronunciation are non-rhoticity – meaning that the “r” at the end of the word isn’t pronounced and “mother” will sound like “muhthuh” – and trap-bath split. In broad terms, this means that certain words like “chance”, “bath”, “can’t”, and “dance” are pronounced with the long A as in “father”.</p><p> To hear RP in action, watch a lot of BBC or travel to Oxford, Cambridge, or Brighton and chat with the locals.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/british-accent-960x640.jpg"                      alt="british accent" title="English Accents: From Queen’s English To Aussie 10"                ></p><p> “All things British” by Aron Van de Pol©</p><p> Additionally, there’s even a heightened version of RP which is only really spoken in television or film. Think of Downton Abbey for reference.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B300x600%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-300x600.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Cockney-Accent"><a href="#Cockney-Accent" class="headerlink" title="Cockney Accent"></a>Cockney Accent</h3><p> Cockney is perhaps the second most famous British English accent after RP. Born as the dialect of the working classes in the East End of London, Cockney is well-known for <a class="link"   href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Cockney%5Frhyming%5Fslang" >cockney rhyming slang <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is… fairly difficult to understand by outsiders.</p><p> Still regarded as a marker of “true” East End London heritage, Cockney accent is characterized by the glottal stop where the letter “t” is pronounced with less intensity, so words like “better” sound more like “be’uh”, and the tendency to swap the “th” sound for “f”, drop the “h” in front of words like “head” and elongate vowels like “a” and “e”.</p><p> To hear the Cockney accent in action, watch the movie Snatch – specifically Jason Statham’s character.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729320&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/2_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Brummie-Accent"><a href="#Brummie-Accent" class="headerlink" title="Brummie Accent"></a>Brummie Accent</h3><p>Awww, doesn’t “Brummie” sound really cute?</p><p> Made famous worldwide “by order of the fo**ing Peaky Blinders”, the Brummie accent, or more formally the Birmingham dialect, was actually one of the most ridiculed English accents in the United Kingdom. Can you believe it?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3mZpcNC69UuXjoME/giphy-downsized-large.gif"                      alt="British accent" title="English Accents: From Queen’s English To Aussie 11"                ></p><p> But I guess it’s true what they say: he who laughs last, laughs best.

If you think about it, there’s hardly a day that passes without using any numbers. When learning a new language – Russian in your case – learning how to count is just as important as learning <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >how to say “hello” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

On top of that, they are not even that hard to learn.

As you may expect, the Russian numbers from 1 to 10 are the most important. Not only these are the ones you’ll probably use the most, but they also lay the foundations for the bigger numbers in Russian.</p><p> Here are the numbers from 1 to 10 in Russian with their respective pronunciations so you can begin practicing right now:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/russian-numbers-1-10-600x424.jpg"                      alt="russian numbers 1-10" title="Russian Numbers - Learn How To Count In Russian 2"                ></p><p> Russian numbers 1-10</p><p><strong>Good to know:</strong> when the numbers один (“one”) and два (“two”) are put before a noun, they can change their form according to the gender of the noun thus:</p><ul><li>masculine: один <em>(odin)</em> ; два <em>(dva)</em></li><li>feminine: одна <em>(odna)</em> ; две <em>(dve)</em></li><li>neuter: одно <em>(odno)</em> ; два <em>(dva)</em></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tinyland.pxf.io/c/5597632/1793214/19135" target="_top" id="1793214"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793214"                      border="0" alt="" width="900" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793214/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Learn-how-to-count-to-20-in-Russian"><a href="#Learn-how-to-count-to-20-in-Russian" class="headerlink" title="Learn how to count to 20 in Russian"></a>Learn how to count to 20 in Russian</h2><p> Did you manage to learn the Russian pronunciation for the first ten numbers?

That’s why it’s important to learn the<strong>colors in Spanish</strong> before (almost) anything else.</p><p> Color is omnipresent in our lives. From the very first moment we become aware of our surroundings, color stimulates our senses. Our mother’s blue eyes comfort us, the yellow banana makes us drool, the red toy car brings excitement and the green veggies are “healthy but disgusting”. Naturally, colors are some of the first words we learn, not just in our native language but in any language. Learning to say the colors in Spanish is also an important first step in <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learning basic Spanish words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . So, let’s dive right in and learn how to say <strong><em>red, blue, green,</em> and</strong> <strong><em>more</em> in Spanish</strong> .</p><h2 id="The-colors-in-Spanish"><a href="#The-colors-in-Spanish" class="headerlink" title="The colors in Spanish"></a>The colors in Spanish</h2><p> Spanish colors are easy enough to remember. At least most of them. Why “most”? Because ‘orange’ in Spanish always seems to be problematic.</p><p> If you are talking about both the color and the fruit,<a href="https://www.rae.es/"><strong>Real Academia Española</strong></a> states that ‘o_range’_ in Spanish is ‘naranja’. ‘Anaranjado’, on the other hand, refers to something that is ‘orange-colored’ or ‘oranged’ (if such a word would exist).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blue-orange-960x640.jpg"                      alt="blue orange" title="Learn The Colors In Spanish – Quick Pronunciation Guide 2"                ></p><p> “Blue orange” by davisuko©</p><p> Now, there are some people who argue that technically, ‘anaranjado’ is the name of the color and ‘naranja’ is the name of the fruit, but that shouldn’t worry you since Real Academia Española gave the green light to ‘naranja’ to be used for both. After all, RAE is the authority when it comes to linguistic regularization in the Spanish-speaking world.</p><p> That being said, the<strong>12 most important colors in Spanish are:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>red — <em>rojo</em></strong></li><li><strong>pink — <em>rosa</em></strong></li><li><strong>orange — <em>naranja</em></strong></li><li><strong>yellow — <em>amarillo</em></strong></li><li><strong>green — <em>verde</em></strong></li><li><strong>blue — <em>azul</em></strong></li><li><strong>brown — <em>marrón</em></strong></li><li><strong>violet — <em>violeta</em></strong></li><li><strong>purple —<em>morado &#x2F; púrpura</em></strong></li><li><strong>cyan —<em>cian</em></strong></li><li><strong>turquoise —<em>turquesa</em></strong></li><li><strong>grey — <em>gris</em></strong></li><li><strong>white — <em>blanco</em></strong></li><li><strong>black — <em>negro</em></strong></li></ul><p> Don’t forget that the colors in Spanish are most of the time used as adjectives. Therefore, they must agree with the gender and number of the noun they are determining. For example, ‘red’ in Spanish will be ‘roja’ if you are talking about <strong><em>u</em> <em>na chaqueta que es roja</em></strong>  (“a jacket that is red”), which is a feminine noun.</p><p> The pronunciation of most of these color names can prove to be really tricky if you don’t have the audio handy. Luckily, you can always play this short video to see how the fluent speakers do it in a quick lesson from Mondly:</p><p>Want more?
