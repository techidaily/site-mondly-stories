Recognizing the value of bilingualism, it’s vital to tap into the receptiveness of your children’s young minds and introduce them to Spanish while it’s still very easy to learn. Encouraging them to start learning Spanish for kids now will equip them with a skill they can use and appreciate throughout their lives as they mature into global citizens.</p><p> The goal is to instill a lasting love for this Romance language and make learning Spanish a fascinating adventure! So, let’s discover what are the best resources to help kids learn Spanish fast. Whether you’re thinking Spanish songs, books, or cartoons – they’re all included in this comprehensive guide.</p><h2 id="Introduction-to-Spanish-for-Kids"><a href="#Introduction-to-Spanish-for-Kids" class="headerlink" title="Introduction to Spanish for Kids"></a>Introduction to Spanish for Kids</h2><p> Teaching the little ones anything – from dinosaur names to Spanish for kids – is extremely simple if you know what methods to use. There are no ‘lazy’ children that ‘won’t study’. Only busy adults. If you give them your time and knowledge, kids’ minds will almost literally absorb all kinds of information, from languages to poetry or basic math, in no time.</p><p> How? Well, their brains have a less developed prefrontal cortex. Thus, they tend to use their imagination much more than us. While adults experience functional fixedness and see everything exactly as it is, <strong>children create unexpected connections to help them learn faster.</strong> Obviously, the difficulty level is different. So adults shouldn’t blame their ‘old’ and ‘dusty’ minds for not retaining information but for their lack of imagination.</p><p> Meanwhile, children have no problem associating new words with seemingly unrelated notions they already know. For example, my 4-year-old nephew associates the word_aburrido_ (‘bored’) with_burro_ (‘donkey’) – a Spanish word he already knew. The connection is Eeyore, the iconic donkey from Winnie the Pooh. He says that “Eeyore always looks sad, tired, and bored”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/HbU5XBerba9ws/giphy.gif"                      alt="spanish for kids" title="Engaging Spanish Learning For Kids: Games, Songs, And Activities 6"                ></p><p> So what is the best way to teach your kids Spanish without resorting to endless and sometimes expensive Spanish classes? Read on to discover all the best resources.</p><h2 id="The-Benefits-of-Learning-Spanish-at-a-Young-Age"><a href="#The-Benefits-of-Learning-Spanish-at-a-Young-Age" class="headerlink" title="The Benefits of Learning Spanish at a Young Age"></a>The Benefits of Learning Spanish at a Young Age</h2><p> <strong>Learning Spanish for kids holds numerous cognitive and social benefits,</strong> especially when starting at a very young age.<a class="link"   href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-17952-001" >Studies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> have consistently shown the extraordinary benefits of bilingualism on children’s intellectual growth. Far from being a burden, as some might believe, learning Spanish at a young age is actually a cognitive boon!</p><p> Bilingual children, such as those who are learning Spanish, frequently outperform their monolingual peers in numerous academic areas, including math, social studies, and reading. Their memory skills are often enhanced, with an improved ability to switch between tasks and solve problems.</p><p> Besides, learning Spanish for kids not only boosts academic performance but also fosters a greater understanding and appreciation for different cultures. Learning Spanish from a young age gives children a global perspective, better equipping them to navigate the multicultural world in the future.</p><p> In brief, <strong>introducing Spanish for kids at an early age is a great investment in your kids’ future because it supports intellectual growth, enhances cognitive flexibility, and encourages cultural sensitivity.</strong> It’s a gift that keeps on giving, benefitting them throughout their lives in many ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/spanish-songs-for-kids-960x640.jpg"                      alt="Spanish songs for kids" title="Engaging Spanish Learning For Kids: Games, Songs, And Activities 7"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137203/26400" target="_top" id="2137203">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137203" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137203/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1328679">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328679.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1328679">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328679.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1328679%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1328679/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Spanish-for-Toddlers"><a href="#Spanish-for-Toddlers" class="headerlink" title="Spanish for Toddlers"></a>Spanish for Toddlers</h2><p> While teaching Spanish for toddlers may initially seem daunting, it is, in fact, a surprisingly achievable goal with the right approach and resources. This task is made easier when it’s made enjoyable and engaging, turning learning into playtime.</p><p> An effortless yet impactful method is to introduce toddlers to Spanish songs and cartoons. Check out the section “Spanish for Kids: Songs, Books, Cartoons &amp; More” listed below, where we share a couple of resources perfect for this age group. You’ll be amazed at how quickly toddlers can pick up new words and phrases when they’re having fun!</p><p> Integrating Spanish into your toddler’s daily activities is another efficient strategy. Here are some practical ways to incorporate basic Spanish for toddlers:</p><ul><li><strong>Counting:</strong> Encourage your toddler to count from 1 to 5 in Spanish_(uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco)_ . Make it a fun game, counting toys, steps, or snacks.</li><li><strong>Body parts:</strong> When giving your toddler a bath or getting them dressed, name their <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >body parts in Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

There’s only one thing you need to keep in mind: Spanish for kindergarten and preschool Spanish are still supposed to be fun!

If you have the possibility to do this, introduce your kids to the Spanish culture and Spanish-speaking communities. This will help them foster a greater understanding and appreciation for diverse cultures.</p><p> Even more, you can encourage your kids to make pen-pals from <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Spanish-speaking countries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or participate together in local Spanish cultural events. This will provide them with much-needed exposure to different dialects, slang, and cultural practices.</p><p> Connecting with Spanish-speaking communities and cultures can be an incredibly enriching and enjoyable adventure you can enjoy together with your children. The immersive experience can make learning Spanish for kids a living, breathing journey rather than just an academic exercise.</p><p> In the end, this is not just about teaching Spanish for kids but helping your children become globally aware and culturally sensitive adults who are grateful for what they’ve become.</p><p>Now let’s look at some frequently asked questions about Spanish for kids.</p><h3 id="Can-a-9-year-old-learn-Spanish"><a href="#Can-a-9-year-old-learn-Spanish" class="headerlink" title="Can a 9-year-old learn Spanish?"></a>Can a 9-year-old learn Spanish?</h3><p> Yes! Starting to learn Spanish as early as 1 year old is entirely possible and beneficial. At this tender age, children are especially receptive to new sounds and patterns, making it an ideal time to introduce a second language like Spanish.</p><h3 id="Can-a-child-learn-Spanish-by-watching-TV"><a href="#Can-a-child-learn-Spanish-by-watching-TV" class="headerlink" title="Can a child learn Spanish by watching TV?"></a>Can a child learn Spanish by watching TV?</h3><p> Yes, a child can learn Spanish by watching TV. Television shows, cartoons and movies in Spanish can immerse children in the Spanish language. The only condition is to handpick the best shows that are non-violent and will have a benefic impact on the child’s vocabulary. To further boost the benefits of watching Spanish TV, it’s recommendable to talk about the show, repeat key phrases or discuss the storylines in Spanish.</p><h3 id="Can-I-teach-my-child-Spanish-if-I’m-not-fluent"><a href="#Can-I-teach-my-child-Spanish-if-I’m-not-fluent" class="headerlink" title="Can I teach my child Spanish if I’m not fluent?"></a>Can I teach my child Spanish if I’m not fluent?</h3><p> Yes, you can support their learning journey by introducing them to songs, books, cartoons, games, movies and TV shows in Spanish. Additionally, language learning apps for kids such as Mondly Kids can further boost their Spanish proficiency. These apps, designed specifically for children, use engaging, game-like activities to reinforce vocabulary and grammatical concepts. They transform learning into a fun adventure, making it more appealing for young learners.</p><h3 id="How-long-does-it-take-for-a-child-to-learn-Spanish"><a href="#How-long-does-it-take-for-a-child-to-learn-Spanish" class="headerlink" title="How long does it take for a child to learn Spanish?"></a>How long does it take for a child to learn Spanish?</h3><p> The learning pace varies from child to child. They certainly learn faster than adults because this is the age when their brains are at their most receptive, poised to absorb new information like sponges. However, every child is different. So make sure to maintain a flexible approach, allowing your child’s interest and readiness to dictate how long it takes to learn Spanish.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/spanish-for-kids/&t=Engaging+Spanish+Learning+for+Kids:+Games,+Songs,+and+Activities"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="Learn-Spanish-fast-in-just-10-minutes-a-day"><a href="#Learn-Spanish-fast-in-just-10-minutes-a-day" class="headerlink" title="Learn Spanish fast in just 10 minutes a day"></a>Learn Spanish fast in just 10 minutes a day</h3><p> Do you want to speak Spanish fluently fast?

Do you know how they say brides need something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue? Well, English had all of that except the blue. Anglo-Saxon words were old,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Shakespeare’s words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> were new and all the loanwords from other languages were borrowed. If you can’t put your finger on the <strong>English words borrowed from other languages, think_café, ballet, fiancé, spaghetti, espresso, pretzel._</strong>  You got the point.</p><p> Of course, this story is far from true, but that doesn’t mean it won’t help you remember how the modern English vocabulary came to be. Unexpected connections are a good strategy for remembering new things. Anyway, enough storytelling for now. Let’s see what common words English “took” from other languages.</p><h2 id="Where-did-English-Come-From"><a href="#Where-did-English-Come-From" class="headerlink" title="Where did English Come From?"></a>Where did English Come From?</h2><p> The earliest forms of English, collectively known as Old English or Anglo-Saxon, developed from the North Sea Germanic languages that came to Britain between the mid-5th and 7th centuries AD. This linguistic influence made its way to Britain through the migration of the Anglo-Saxons from what is now northwest Germany, southern Denmark, and the Netherlands.</p><p> Not long after that, in the 8th and 9th centuries, Old English began to borrow foreign words from the Old-<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Norse-speaking Viking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> invaders and settlers. Subsequently, in the late 11th century, Middle English emerged, marked by a new influx of borrowed words from Old French following the Norman Conquest of England.</p><p> Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the Renaissance trend of borrowing Latin and Greek words and roots, which also coincided with the Great Vowel Shift. The era culminated in the King James Bible and the works of William Shakespeare.</p><p> While the question may sound funny (“where did English come from?”), it is a popular inquiry among Google users for obvious reasons. After all, 1.3 billion people worldwide speak English either natively or as a second language. It’s only natural for them to be curious about the origin of the English language.</p><h2 id="English-Words-from-Foreign-Languages"><a href="#English-Words-from-Foreign-Languages" class="headerlink" title="English Words from Foreign Languages"></a>English Words from Foreign Languages</h2><ol><li>Guru (Sanskrit)</li><li>Tsunami (Japanese)</li><li>Versatile (Latin)</li><li>Vodka (Russian)</li><li>Chocolate (Nahuatl, an Aztec language)</li><li>Algebra (Arabic)</li><li>Banana (Wolof, a language spoken in Senegal)</li><li>Robot (Czech)</li><li>Tycoon (Japanese)</li><li>Yoga (Sanskrit)</li><li>Shampoo (Hindi)</li><li>Taco (Nahuatl)</li><li>Safari (Arabic)</li><li>Kangaroo (Guugu Yimithirr, an Australian Aboriginal language)</li><li>Czar (Russian)</li><li>Jungle (Hindi)</li><li>Boomerang (Dharuk, an Australian Aboriginal language)</li><li>Sushi (Japanese)</li><li>Pajamas (Hindi)</li><li>Loot (Sanskrit)</li><li>Mosquito (Latin)</li><li>Karaoke (Japanese)</li><li>Lemon (Arabic)</li><li>Penguin (Welsh)</li><li>Ninja (Japanese)</li><li>Ketchup (Chinese)</li><li>Algebra (Arabic)</li><li>Metropolis (Greek)</li><li>Avatar (Sanskrit)</li><li>Nemesis (Greek)</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/english-foreign-words-600x600.png"                      alt="English foreign words" title="100+ English Words Borrowed From Other Languages 4"                ></p><p> Although we usually call them “borrowed words”, these are also known as loanwords. According to Oxford Languages,<strong>a loanword</strong> is_“a word adopted from a foreign language with little or no modification”_ . The transition from one language to another can happen through:</p><ul><li><strong>Transcription,</strong> which means borrowing words while preserving their original pronunciation in the borrowed language;</li><li><strong>Transliteration,</strong> which involves adapting the written form of the loanword in accordance with the alphabet of the borrowing language;</li><li><strong>Loan translation,</strong> also known as calque, which involves borrowing words, phrases, or expressions by translating their literal meanings into the borrowing language.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/themes/mondly/img/mondly-banner-icon.png"                      alt="mondly banner icon" title="100+ English Words Borrowed From Other Languages 5"                ></p><h5 id="Improve-your-English-fast-🚀"><a href="#Improve-your-English-fast-🚀" class="headerlink" title="Improve your English fast 🚀"></a>Improve your English fast 🚀</h5><p> With Mondly, English mastery is at your fingertips – and in your native tongue.

Words related to everyday life, family, and community were among the earliest borrowings. Later, thanks to Germany’s influence in various fields, English borrowed German words related to science and technology, music, philosophy, literature and engineering.</p><h2 id="Understanding-the-Size-of-the-English-Vocabulary"><a href="#Understanding-the-Size-of-the-English-Vocabulary" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Size of the English Vocabulary"></a>Understanding the Size of the English Vocabulary</h2><p> How many words are there in English? Many sources agree that<strong>the English language consists of roughly 470,000 words.</strong> However, most linguists advise to take that with a pinch of salt. While some words have become obsolete, new additions are always making their way into the English vocabulary, so it’s difficult to put our finger on an exact number. Then, there’s also the question of different variations of a single word like “go”, “went”, “gone”. Do we count that as a single word or as three separate ones?</p><p> One thing is certain: the English vocabulary is still expanding. As you know, English does not only borrow words from other languages, but it also constantly coins new words to reflect advances in technology.</p><p>Loading poll …</p><p>Coming Soon</p><p> Do you believe the claim that ~80% of the English vocabulary is borrowed from other languages?</p><p> Yes, English is a linguistic melting pot.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Simultaneous-Sentence-Synthesis"><a href="#Simultaneous-Sentence-Synthesis" class="headerlink" title="Simultaneous Sentence Synthesis"></a>Simultaneous Sentence Synthesis</h2><p><em>Can you learn two languages at once?</em> If you asked the World Wide Web this question, you must be a language lover. And a brave one too! Many people ask whether they can learn German in a year. You, on the other hand, raised the bar high. You don’t want to learn_<strong>a</strong>_ language. No. You want to learn_<strong>multiple</strong>_ languages at once. Good for you!</p><p> Considering your bravery, we’re honored to answer your inquiry. As a matter of fact, we’re a language learning app ourselves, so we have a lot of experience with learning (and teaching) multiple languages. Here we go!</p><h2 id="Can-you-learn-two-languages-at-once"><a href="#Can-you-learn-two-languages-at-once" class="headerlink" title="Can you learn two languages at once?"></a>Can you learn two languages at once?</h2><p> <strong>The short answer is_yes_ .</strong> If you set your mind to learning two languages at once, you can do it. However, before taking on this task, there are a lot of things you should consider.</p><p> Many will either give a hard yes or a hard no. But, in reality, the situation is far from black or white. It all depends on you and your abilities and limitations. You can do it if you are determined and stick to it until the end. If not, the entire process will prove extremely laborious.</p><p> Our biggest and most important advice is to<strong>choose two languages that are different from each other.</strong> Forget about trying to learn Spanish and Italian at the same time. The whole deal could end in you speaking “Spalian” and we don’t want that.</p><p> No, the secret is to balance things perfectly. So, choose two languages that share some similarities, but they are distinct enough not to cause confusion. Take English and German, for example. Their similarities will help you make beneficial connections, but not to the point where you mistake one for the other.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/themes/mondly/img/mondly-banner-icon.png"                      alt="mondly banner icon" title="Learn Multiple Languages At Once 2"                ></p><h5 id="Learn-two-languages-at-once"><a href="#Learn-two-languages-at-once" class="headerlink" title="Learn two languages at once"></a>Learn two languages at once</h5><p> With Mondly, you can learn not 2, but 41 languages at once.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-9547&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-9547&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-9547&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-9547&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-9547&mt=8" >Start now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134224/18498" target="_top" id="2134224">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134224" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134224/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-it-recommended-to-learn-two-languages-at-once"><a href="#Is-it-recommended-to-learn-two-languages-at-once" class="headerlink" title="Is it recommended to learn two languages at once?"></a>Is it recommended to learn two languages at once?</h2><p> Now, this is a whole different language. You can learn two languages at once, but is it recommended to do so? Not really.</p><p>Let me explain.</p><p> Despite what your boss says, multitasking is not good. It is indeed a cool word, but research has shown time and time again that<strong>multitasking is not productive.</strong> When you multi-task and learn multiple languages at once, it’s very<strong>hard to enter a state of deep focus</strong> that allows you to make connections and learn the language in an instinctive way.</p><p> Instead, it is easier and maybe even faster to learn the languages one after the other. This way, you will focus on only one language at a time, avoid confusion, and give your brain time to cement the knowledge before moving to a new lingo. That is if you’re serious about reaching fluency in two languages at once.</p><p> If you want to learn multiple languages for fun at a basic level, go for it. But again, it’s best to choose completely different languages so you can switch easily between them and not mix things up.</p><p> Take it from us, a language learning app teaching 41 languages. We would love for you to learn multiple languages at once. However, we know better than to recommend something that is not guaranteed to make your life easier. Therefore, our advice would be to learn one language now and maybe make it your <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >New Year’s resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to learn the other one next year.</p><h2 id="What-are-the-benefits-of-learning-multiple-languages"><a href="#What-are-the-benefits-of-learning-multiple-languages" class="headerlink" title="What are the benefits of learning multiple languages?"></a>What are the benefits of learning multiple languages?</h2><p> Language learning, in general, has many benefits. We can all probably agree that the most important are the <a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875"><strong>cognitive benefits</strong></a> . Moreover, if you learn new languages, you will also become more<strong>culturally aware,</strong> which is one of the best things you can do for yourself. And the list goes on. Learning a new language is a true gold mine for you. Here are some of the benefits of language learning:</p><ul><li>career advantages;</li><li>improved communication skills;</li><li>boosted self-confidence;</li><li>personal satisfaction;</li><li>networking opportunities;</li><li>and more.</li></ul><p> Now, imagine what happens with all these benefits when you learn multiple languages at once. They double or maybe triple.</p><p> The winner of this equation is, undoubtedly, your brain. While it is hard to focus on learning multiple languages at once, if you manage to do it, it has loads of benefits for it as the process encourages the brain to form new neural connections. In turn, this leads to the grey matter becoming denser, which is good! Very good, in fact!</p><p> TL;DR: The benefits of learning multiple languages are many. However, the most important one is that it results in the enlargement of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, enhancing your brain’s health.</p><h2 id="How-difficult-is-it-to-learn-multiple-languages-at-once"><a href="#How-difficult-is-it-to-learn-multiple-languages-at-once" class="headerlink" title="How difficult is it to learn multiple languages at once?"></a>How difficult is it to learn multiple languages at once?</h2><p> Difficult, but not impossible. Probably the most challenging part is to differentiate the languages you’re learning. For that, we recommend choosing completely different languages and creating unique study routines for all of them.</p><p> The difficulty of learning multiple languages at once also depends on how good you actually are at learning languages. We all know people who learn languages very fast and in a very natural way. These people probably have two very well-developed areas of the brain: Broca’s area and Wernicke’s area. One is responsible for the generation of articulate speech and the other is vital in the comprehension of written and spoken language.</p><p> For example, Ziad Youssef Fasah is a polyglot born in Liberia, brought up in Beirut, who also lived (and maybe still does) in Brazil. He claims to be able to speak 58 languages and be fluent in approximately 15 of them. A great feat, no doubt! Considering the astonishing number of languages he speaks, it’s safe to say he probably learned some of them at the same time. If he did it, it means it’s not impossible.</p><p> All in all, the difficulty level of learning multiple languages at once depends entirely on your capabilities. The more gifted you are at learning languages, the easier it will be.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/can-you-learn-two-languages-at-once-960x640.jpg"                      alt="can you learn two languages at once?" title="Learn Multiple Languages At Once 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151859/7443" target="_top" id="2151859">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151859" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151859/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-for-learning-multiple-languages-at-once"><a href="#Tips-for-learning-multiple-languages-at-once" class="headerlink" title="Tips for learning multiple languages at once"></a>Tips for learning multiple languages at once</h2><p> If you really want to learn, let’s say, two languages at once and cannot be convinced to leave one of them for later, these tips may come in handy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082535/7443" target="_top" id="2082535">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082535" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082535/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Choose-languages-that-are-different-from-each-other"><a href="#1-Choose-languages-that-are-different-from-each-other" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose languages that are different from each other"></a>1. Choose languages that are different from each other</h3><p> To avoid confusion when learning two languages at once, it’s best to choose different languages. And when we say different, we say<strong>different</strong> . Not Swedish and Danish and definitely not Spanish and Portuguese.</p><p> As you yourself know, these language pairs are very similar and learning them together may result in mix-ups. “What kind of mix-ups?” – you ask. Well, like using several Portuguese words in a Spanish sentence. For this reason, it’s best if you choose languages from different language families.</p><h3 id="2-Immerse-yourself-in-the-languages-as-much-as-possible"><a href="#2-Immerse-yourself-in-the-languages-as-much-as-possible" class="headerlink" title="2. Immerse yourself in the languages as much as possible"></a>2. Immerse yourself in the languages as much as possible</h3><p> Different languages reflect different cultures. By immersing yourself in them, you’ll not only be able to clearly differentiate between the languages you’re learning, but you will also get fluent faster.</p><h3 id="3-Create-a-smart-study-schedule"><a href="#3-Create-a-smart-study-schedule" class="headerlink" title="3. Create a smart study schedule"></a>3. Create a smart study schedule</h3><p> When learning multiple languages at once, it’s important to organize your time wisely.</p><p> Avoid studying both languages during the same study session, as you may get confused. Instead, create different study sessions for each language to help you have a clear separation of what you’re trying to learn. Maybe study one language in the morning and the other in the evenings. Or, even better, split the days of the week evenly between the languages you’re trying to learn. If you’re learning two languages, you can have three days for each and one day to let your brain rest.</p><h3 id="4-Try-a-different-learning-method-for-each-language"><a href="#4-Try-a-different-learning-method-for-each-language" class="headerlink" title="4. Try a different learning method for each language"></a>4. Try a different learning method for each language</h3><p> There are several learning styles you can use to study languages: visual (spatial), aural (auditory-musical), verbal (linguistic), physical (kinesthetic), logical (mathematical), social (interpersonal) and solitary (intrapersonal).</p><p> If more than one works for you, great! This means you can also use different learning styles for the languages you want to learn. For example, learning logically may work best if you want to learn the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Korean alphabet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> In addition, some areas of the curriculum might be better fitted to study using a language learning app such as <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-9547&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-9547&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-9547" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

This usually occurs when a child is exposed consistently and naturally to both languages from an early age. This can happen in bilingual families, where each parent speaks a different language, in multilingual communities where several languages are part of daily life, or through early educational environments that emphasize bilingualism.</p><h3 id="How-can-I-become-fluent-in-two-languages"><a href="#How-can-I-become-fluent-in-two-languages" class="headerlink" title="How can I become fluent in two languages?"></a>How can I become fluent in two languages?</h3><p> To become fluent in two languages, you need to immerse yourself in both languages through consistent practice. This can be achieved by engaging with fluent speakers, consuming content in the target languages, taking courses, and using language learning apps and other resources. Regular practice in speaking, listening, reading, and writing is crucial, along with setting realistic goals and being patient with your progress.</p><h3 id="How-to-learn-multiple-languages"><a href="#How-to-learn-multiple-languages" class="headerlink" title="How to learn multiple languages?"></a>How to learn multiple languages?</h3><p> To learn multiple languages effectively, focus on immersive learning and consistent practice. Start by building a strong foundation in each language through structured courses or self-study, then enhance your skills by regularly engaging with native speakers, consuming media like films, music, and books in those said languages, and using language learning apps for daily practice. Balancing your time between languages, setting achievable goals, and immersing yourself in the cultures related to the languages can significantly boost your proficiency.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/learn-multiple-languages/&t=Learn+Multiple+Languages+at+Once"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="Learn-multiple-languages-with-Mondly"><a href="#Learn-multiple-languages-with-Mondly" class="headerlink" title="Learn multiple languages with Mondly"></a>Learn multiple languages with Mondly</h3><p> Do you want to learn two languages at once?

Fortunately, learning how to count in Spanish is much easier than going to the gym because Spanish numbers follow a simple and predictable pattern that doesn’t make every muscle in your body sore. Once you know how to count to 10 in Spanish, counting to 20, 30, 100, and beyond is easy.</p><p> Learning how to count is crucial if you decide to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Although we may not always acknowledge it, numbers or_números_ (as you’d call them in Spanish) are essential to our day-to-day lives. From shopping to setting up a meeting, telling time, or giving someone your phone number – they really are one of the most basic and important language lessons. So let’s crack the mystery and discover what comes after_uno_ ,<em>dos,</em> and_tres_ . Because Pitbull only gets us so far.</p><h2 id="Spanish-numbers-1-to-30"><a href="#Spanish-numbers-1-to-30" class="headerlink" title="Spanish numbers 1 to 30"></a>Spanish numbers 1 to 30</h2><p> One of my Danish friends discovered how important Spanish numbers actually are when he needed to tell someone <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >the time in Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and had no idea that “five” is_cinco_ in Spanish.

Especially when it takes just 10 minutes to master it.</p><p> The secret to mastering the Spanish numbers is to learn how to count to 10. “Is that it?” – you’ll say. Well, not entirely. But the first ten numbers are important for two reasons. One: you will probably use them a LOT. And two: they lay the foundations for the next Spanish numbers. Here is the Spanish numbers 1 to 10:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/count-to-10-in-spanish-600x600.jpg"  title="Spanish Numbers: How To Count Numbers In Spanish 2">count to 10 in Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5393&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5393?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=es&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5393?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=es" >https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5393&amp;fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5393?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es&amp;redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&amp;redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&amp;redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5393?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> Count to 10 in Spanish</p><p> I know what you are thinking.

However, the numbers from 11 to 15 are a bit irregular, so you’ll have to remember them by heart:</p><p> 11 –<em>once</em></p><p> 12 –<em>doce</em></p><p> 13 –<em>trece</em></p><p> 14 –<em>catorce</em></p><p> 15 –<em>quince</em></p><p> Then, from 16 to 19 and even beyond, Spanish numbers are formed following the pattern 10_(diez)_ + number.</p><p> 16 –<em>dieciséis</em></p><p> 17 –<em>diecisiete</em></p><p> 18 –<em>dieciocho</em></p><p> 19 –<em>diecinueve</em></p><p> Easy, isn’t it? And from here on, the rule stays the same. Once you know the tens, you’ll easily know how to count up to 100_(cien)_ in Spanish. Here’s are the Spanish numbers to 40 in a nutshell:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/spanish-numbers-1-960x660.jpg"  title="Spanish Numbers: How To Count Numbers In Spanish 3">spanish numbers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5393&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5393?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=es&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5393?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=es" >https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5393&amp;fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5393?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es&amp;redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&amp;redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&amp;redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5393?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> The Spanish numbers up to 40</p><p> As you can see, up to 30 (“thirty”), the numbers are bound together, but from there on they part ways to make counting in Spanish even easier for you.

Additionally, from 200 onwards, we also add an “s” at the end to make it plural:<em>dosciento, trescientos,</em> and so on. And a little secret: in Spanish, the hundreds can be either masculine or feminine (depending on the noun they accompany). For example, “two hundred books” will be <em>doscient<strong>o</strong> s libros</em> , but to say “two hundred apples” we’ll say <em>doscient<strong>a</strong> s manzanas</em> .</p><p>Here are some more examples:</p><ul><li>204 – <em>doscientos cuatro</em></li><li>323 – <em>trescientos veintitrés</em></li><li>747 – <em>setecientos cuarenta y siete</em></li><li>999 – <em>novecientos noventa y nueve</em></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/count-in-spanish-960x663.jpg"                      alt="count in Spanish" title="Spanish Numbers: How To Count Numbers In Spanish 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135396/19272" target="_top" id="2135396">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135396" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135396/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Barcelona, Spain</p><p> If you want to go even further, thousands and millions work exactly like in English: number +<em>mil</em> (“thousand”) or_millón_ (“million”).

How does one type Spanish accent marks on a standard keyboard? How does the pronunciation of a word shift with the addition of an accent mark? Do these marks affect the stress of a word? And how can one remember when they’re necessary?</p><p> If you’re not yet familiar with the primary rules of Spanish accents, these questions might seem daunting. However, it’s crucial not to get discouraged! Accents play a vital role in languages that incorporate them—not only in Spanish. It’s essential to understand that the presence or absence of an accent mark can drastically alter the meaning of a word. Mastering the use of accents is indispensable for anyone aiming to become proficient in Spanish. Here are the key facts you need to know about Spanish accents.</p><h2 id="Spanish-Accent-Marks"><a href="#Spanish-Accent-Marks" class="headerlink" title="Spanish Accent Marks"></a>Spanish Accent Marks</h2><p> Spanish accent marks or Spanish accents can also be referred to as diacritics, diacritical marks or diacritical signs. These represent an extra symbol or glyph added to a letter.</p><p>The Spanish language has three types of accent marks:</p><ul><li><strong>Tilde</strong></li><li><strong>Acute accents</strong></li><li><strong>Diaeresis</strong></li></ul><h3 id="Tilde"><a href="#Tilde" class="headerlink" title="Tilde"></a>Tilde</h3><p> The tilde is only applied to the letter “n”, creating the character “ñ”, which is considered a separate letter in the Spanish alphabet and appears as such in dictionaries. Also known as_la tilde de la eñe_ or_la virgulilla_ , “ñ” appears in words such as_niño_ (“child”),<em>mañana</em> (“tomorrow”),<em>señor</em> (“mister, sir”),<em>año</em> (“year”) and even_español_ (“Spanish” – the language).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135407/19272" target="_top" id="2135407">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135407" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135407/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Diaeresis"><a href="#Diaeresis" class="headerlink" title="Diaeresis"></a>Diaeresis</h3><p> The diaeresis is only found on the letter “u”, marked by two dots above it_(ü)_ . It indicates that the “u” should be pronounced independently, as a separate vowel, not as part of a digraph or diphthong. Although rare, the diaeresis in Spanish is typically placed immediately after “g” or immediately before “e” or “i” in a word. In case you were wondering, yes, it is distinct from an umlaut, which denotes a sound shift.</p><h3 id="Acute-Accent"><a href="#Acute-Accent" class="headerlink" title="Acute Accent"></a>Acute Accent</h3><p> The acute accent, represented by a short diagonal line above vowels, is the most common accent mark in Spanish. Acute accents occur only once per word and their purpose is to stress words, distinguish between otherwise identical words and indicate questions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spanish-accent-marks-960x640.png"                      alt="Spanish accent marks" title="How To Type And Pronounce Spanish Accents: Complete Guide 5"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657396/16446" target="_top" id="1657396">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657396" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657396/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="All-Spanish-Accents-Letters"><a href="#All-Spanish-Accents-Letters" class="headerlink" title="All Spanish Accents Letters"></a>All Spanish Accents Letters</h2><ul><li><strong>á</strong></li><li><strong>é</strong></li><li><strong>í</strong></li><li><strong>ó</strong></li><li><strong>ú</strong></li><li><strong>ñ</strong></li><li><strong>ü</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Spanish uses accent marks on only six different letters</strong> <strong>.</strong> Accent marks are never applied to any other letters in the alphabet, so it’s easy to remember them.

A helpful option for practice is to use the Mondly Chatbot, where you can both SEE and HEAR the words.</p><p> In Spanish, stress and accents are closely related as they help distinguish between words in both pronunciation and meaning. For example,<em>‘ella mandó una carta’</em> means ‘she sent a letter’, while_‘yo mando una carta’_ means ‘I send a letter’. Here are some additional examples where accent marks can completely change the meaning of a word in Spanish:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Spanish words with accent marks</th><th>Spanish words without accent marks</th><th>Example sentence using both words</th><th>Translation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>tú</em> (you)</td><td><em>tu</em> (your)</td><td><em>Tú tienes un perro muy bonito. ¿Es tu única mascota?</em></td><td>You have a very cute dog. Is it your only pet?</td></tr><tr><td><em>té</em> (tea)</td><td><em>te</em> (you)</td><td><em>Te recomiendo que tomes mucho té.</em></td><td>I recommend that you drink a lot of tea.</td></tr><tr><td><em>cómo</em> (how&#x2F;what)</td><td><em>como</em> (like, as)</td><td><em>¿Cómo se llama tu colega? ¿Es tan inteligente como Cristian?</em></td><td>What is your colleague’s name? Is he as smart as Cristian?</td></tr><tr><td><em>él</em> (he)</td><td><em>el</em> (the)</td><td><em>A él le gusta el vino.</em></td><td>He likes the wine.</td></tr><tr><td><em>sí</em> (yes)</td><td><em>si</em> (if)</td><td><em>Sí, quiero probar el chorizo pero solo si no es picante.</em></td><td>Yes, I want to try the pork sausage but only if it is not spicy.</td></tr></tbody></table><p> As you can see, Spanish differentiates between homonyms by using accent marks. Once you understand how Spanish accent marks make everything easier, you’ll love learning about them!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/themes/mondly/img/mondly-banner-icon.png"                      alt="mondly banner icon" title="How To Type And Pronounce Spanish Accents: Complete Guide 6"                ></p><h5 id="Learn-Spanish-today-💃"><a href="#Learn-Spanish-today-💃" class="headerlink" title="Learn Spanish today 💃"></a>Learn Spanish today 💃</h5><p> Build practical Spanish skills for real life with Mondly.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-2792&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-2792&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-2792&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-2792&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-2792&mt=8" >Start Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Spanish-Accents-Rules"><a href="#Spanish-Accents-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Spanish Accents Rules"></a>Spanish Accents Rules</h2><p> Acute accents are necessary in Spanish to indicate the stressed syllable, especially in the following cases:</p><ol><li>When a word ends in a vowel, -n, or -s and the stress is on the last syllable.

While initially daunting for those unfamiliar with accent marks, understanding their significance is crucial. Accents not only affect pronunciation and stress but also alter the meaning of words significantly. By familiarizing oneself with the primary rules governing Spanish accents, such as those indicating stress placement and distinguishing between homonyms, learners can navigate the language with confidence. Whether it’s remembering when to use accents or grasping their role in pronunciation, embracing the nuances of Spanish accents is a vital step toward fluency.</p><p>Before you go, make sure you check out these FAQs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014854/22899" target="_top" id="2014854">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014854" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014854/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Why-are-accents-important-in-Spanish-pronunciation"><a href="#Why-are-accents-important-in-Spanish-pronunciation" class="headerlink" title="Why are accents important in Spanish pronunciation?"></a>Why are accents important in Spanish pronunciation?</h3><p> Accents are important in Spanish pronunciation because they indicate which syllable to stress or emphasize in a word, helping to differentiate between words that are spelled similarly but have different meanings.</p><h3 id="What-are-the-most-common-mistakes-when-using-Spanish-accents"><a href="#What-are-the-most-common-mistakes-when-using-Spanish-accents" class="headerlink" title="What are the most common mistakes when using Spanish accents?"></a>What are the most common mistakes when using Spanish accents?</h3><p> The most common mistakes when using Spanish accents include omitting accents where they’re needed, placing them incorrectly, or misinterpreting their purpose, which can lead to mispronunciations or misunderstandings in written communication.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/spanish-accents-how-to-type-pronounce-and-master-them-all/&t=How+to+Type+and+Pronounce+Spanish+Accents:+Complete+Guide"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h4 id="Spanish-language-pronunciation-made-easy"><a href="#Spanish-language-pronunciation-made-easy" class="headerlink" title="Spanish language pronunciation made easy"></a>Spanish language pronunciation made easy</h4><p> Do you want to speak Spanish fluently fast?

This little trick applies to any language, not just Korean.</p><p> As you can see, all days in Korean end in<strong>요일 (’yoil’) which translates to ‘day’ in English.</strong> Now all that remains to be analyzed is a single Korean character at the beginning of each of the seven words. Here’s what each day in Korean means in English:</p><ul><li><strong>월 (wol)</strong> in 월요일 (wollyoil – Monday) means <strong>‘moon’</strong></li><li><strong>화 (hwa)</strong> in 화요일 (hwayoil – Tuesday) means <strong>‘fire’</strong></li><li><strong>수 (su)</strong> in 수요일 (suyoil – Wednesday) means <strong>‘water’</strong></li><li><strong>목 (mok)</strong> in 목요일 (mogyoil – Thursday) means <strong>‘wood’ or ‘tree’</strong></li><li><strong>금 (geum)</strong> in 금요일 (geumyoil – Friday) means <strong>‘gold’</strong></li><li><strong>토 (to)</strong> in 토요일 (toyoil – Saturday) means <strong>‘soil’ or ‘earth’</strong></li><li><strong>일 (il)</strong> in 일요일 (illyoil – Sunday) means <strong>‘day’ or ‘sun’</strong></li></ul><p> We can all agree that Koreans are right: Friday is indeed ‘gold’ and we all love it!</p><p> As a little bonus, here’s an image that may come in handy later. Save it or screenshot it and use it to practice what you’ve just learned.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/days-of-the-week-in-korean.png"                      alt="days of the week in korean" title="The Days Of The Week In Korean 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136545/16384" target="_top" id="2136545">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136545" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136545/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Days of the week in Korean</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082539/7443" target="_top" id="2082539">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082539" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082539/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Sample-phrases-with-each-day-of-the-week-in-Korean"><a href="#Sample-phrases-with-each-day-of-the-week-in-Korean" class="headerlink" title="Sample phrases with each day of the week in Korean"></a>Sample phrases with each day of the week in Korean</h2><p> If it’s all clear so far, let’s dive into some examples using the days of the week in Korean.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Shakespeare’s-Sonnet-Scribbled-Into-Today’s-Vernacular"><a href="#Shakespeare’s-Sonnet-Scribbled-Into-Today’s-Vernacular" class="headerlink" title="Shakespeare’s Sonnet Scribbled Into Today’s Vernacular"></a>Shakespeare’s Sonnet Scribbled Into Today’s Vernacular</h2><p> We, as speakers of the English language, owe a great debt to William Shakespeare. He wasn’t just one of the greatest playwrights of all time, but also a prolific inventor of words. Many of the<strong>words Shakespeare invented</strong> or coined are still in common use today. The masterful storyteller had so much to express that he needed to push the boundaries of the English vocabulary as he knew it.<strong>Some of the most surprisingly common words Shakespeare invented are:</strong></p><ul><li>bedroom</li><li>embrace</li><li>employer</li><li>excitement</li><li>fashionable</li><li>generous</li><li>informal</li><li>invitation</li><li>lonely</li><li>manager</li><li>satisfying</li><li>useful</li></ul><p> And these are just a few of the words Shakespeare introduced to the world during his life in the Elizabethan England. Whether you’re a fan of Shakespeare or simply enjoy learning about the evolution of the English language, this article is sure to captivate and entertain you. So stick around and read on to discover some more of the words Shakespeare invented.</p><h2 id="How-many-words-did-Shakespeare-invent"><a href="#How-many-words-did-Shakespeare-invent" class="headerlink" title="How many words did Shakespeare invent?"></a>How many words did Shakespeare invent?</h2><p><strong>Most sources agree that Shakespeare invented around 1700 words.</strong> However, it seems there’s more to this story. While the playwright was indeed very productive in this field, some say that not all these words were created by him. Instead, he was just the first one to document these words in writing. And that’s entirely possible.</p><p> Let’s look at this way. <strong>There is a good likelihood that some of the words attributed to Shakespeare were used in Elizabethan England on a daily basis. Only not in writing.</strong> And what did Shakespeare do? He naturally introduced them in his work after having heard them in conversations with peers or other people. In these instances, Shakespeare is recorded as the first individual to have written documentation of these words.</p><p> As a matter of fact, occasional <a class="link"   href="https://blogs.loc.gov/folklife/2020/04/proverbs-myths-and-the-bard-are-we-really-quoting-shakespeare/" >new research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> reveals that Shakespeare was actually not the originator of some of these terms. The Oxford English Dictionary holds a vast amount of words for which it lists Shakespeare as the first recorded usage, leading to the widespread assertion that Shakespeare was a prodigious coiner of words. But as it turns out, most of the OED editors at that time chose Shakespeare as a source simply because he was the earliest author they looked at.</p><p> According to the <a class="link"   href="https://public.oed.com/history/oed-editions/" >OED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the most frequently quoted single author in the Second Edition of the Dictionary (published in 1989) is William Shakespeare with approximately 33,300 quotations.</p><p> Be that as it may, we’re not suggesting Shakespeare was not a genius of words. We’re simply stating we should take numbers with a grain of salt.</p><h3 id="How-did-Shakespeare-invent-words"><a href="#How-did-Shakespeare-invent-words" class="headerlink" title="How did Shakespeare invent words?"></a>How did Shakespeare invent words?</h3><p> The master storyteller famously invented new words pretty much the same way we do today: through prefixes, suffixes, conversion and compounds. Simply put, Shakespeare’s words were created by:</p><ul><li>turning nouns into verbs;</li><li>using verbs as adjectives;</li><li>connecting words that have never before been used together before;</li><li>adding prefixes or suffixes;</li><li>concocting entirely original terms.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shakespeare-words.jpg"                      alt="Shakespeare words" title="Shakespeare’s Words: 36 Words Shakespeare Invented That We Still Use Today 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037334/7443" target="_top" id="2037334">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037334" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037334/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Cool-words-Shakespeare-invented"><a href="#Cool-words-Shakespeare-invented" class="headerlink" title="Cool words Shakespeare invented"></a>Cool words Shakespeare invented</h2><p><em>To invent new words, or not to invent new words?</em> Clearly, William Shakespeare did not ask himself that. He just went with it and invented new words so he could properly tell his stories. In the end, he was so good at both storytelling and coining words that today it is impossible to have an English curriculum without Shakespeare. But enough tittle-tattle.<strong>Let’s see what other words Shakespeare invented:</strong></p><h3 id="1-Addiction"><a href="#1-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="1. Addiction"></a><strong>1.

Out of these, a third are now endangered. And out of this third, many have less than 1,000 speakers remaining. But what is the oldest of them? What are the oldest languages in the world? What did the first words our ancestors spoke sound like?</p><p> As new evidence resurfaces every day, we can’t yet know what’s the first language ever spoken. But linguists and historians agree that these are<strong>the oldest languages in the world:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Akkadian</strong></li><li><strong>Arabic</strong></li><li><strong>Aramaic</strong></li><li><strong>Chinese</strong></li><li><strong>Egyptian</strong></li><li><strong>Elamite</strong></li><li><strong>Greek</strong></li><li><strong>Hebrew</strong></li><li><strong>Hittite</strong></li><li><strong>Hurrian</strong></li><li><strong>Irish Gaelic</strong></li><li><strong>Latin</strong></li><li><strong>Mycenaean Greek</strong></li><li><strong>Palaic</strong></li><li><strong>Sanskrit</strong></li><li><strong>Sumerian</strong></li><li><strong>Tamil</strong></li></ul><p> Languages have always been fascinating because of the role they played as one of the pillars of civilization on Earth. Imagine a world where beings don’t communicate. What does that world look like? It’s unimaginable. Languages have shaped humanity for ages and continue to do so even today. They are fluid and in a continuous evolution. But their timeless metamorphosis makes it hard for historians and linguists to determine what are the oldest languages in the world.</p><h2 id="What-was-the-first-language-on-Earth"><a href="#What-was-the-first-language-on-Earth" class="headerlink" title="What was the first language on Earth?"></a>What was the first language on Earth?</h2><p> We only know what history tells us. And history says the first spoken language appeared 10,000 years ago. But we can never know for sure because no one was there to confirm. So there is only one way to judge the age of a language: by the earliest proof of its written form. However, this still remains guesswork, as it’s always possible that archaeologists might discover something new tomorrow. Something that could change history as we know it. Furthermore, these ancient languages were surely in use long before they were written in stone or on papyruses. But for how long? It remains a mystery.</p><p> Needless to say, the first human languages were likely simple, consisting of basic sounds and gestures used to communicate basic survival needs such as food, water, and shelter. Over time, these early languages evolved and diversified as human societies grew more complex and began to engage in trade, agriculture, and other activities.</p><p> While<strong>we may never know for sure what the first human language was,</strong> current research suggests that language has been a fundamental part of the human experience for thousands of generations and that it continues to evolve and adapt to our changing world.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/themes/mondly/img/mondly-banner-icon.png"                      alt="mondly banner icon" title="The First &Amp; Oldest Languages Ever Spoken: Origins Of Human Communication 2"                ></p><h5 id="Do-you-want-to-learn-some-of-the-oldest-languages-on-Earth"><a href="#Do-you-want-to-learn-some-of-the-oldest-languages-on-Earth" class="headerlink" title="Do you want to learn some of the oldest languages on Earth?"></a>Do you want to learn some of the oldest languages on Earth?</h5><p> Mondly offers courses in Greek, Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew and even Latin.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-4757&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-4757&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-4757&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-4757&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-4757&mt=8" >Start Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Ancient-languages-the-oldest-dead-languages-on-Earth"><a href="#Ancient-languages-the-oldest-dead-languages-on-Earth" class="headerlink" title="Ancient languages: the oldest dead languages on Earth"></a>Ancient languages: the oldest dead languages on Earth</h2><p><strong>Ancient languages</strong> typically refer to<strong>old extinct languages</strong> that no longer have any speakers.

Thus, given this evidence, Sumerian can also be considered<strong>the first language in the world</strong> or one of the ancient languages.</p><p> Sumerian was gradually replaced by Akkadian as a spoken language around 2000 BC, but it continued to be used as a literary, ceremonial, scientific and sacred language until the 1st century AD. Unknown to the modern world until the 19th century when Assyriologists began deciphering its cuneiform inscriptions, written Sumerian can be divided into several time periods: Archaic Sumerian (31st–26th century BC), Old or Classical Sumerian (26th–23rd century BC), Neo-Sumerian (23rd–21st century BC), Late Sumerian (20th–18th century BC) and Post-Sumerian (after 1700 BC).</p><p>Other ancient languages that are now extinct are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurrian%5Flanguage"><strong>Hurrian</strong></a> – oldest proof of written Hurrian dates back to the 21st century BC;</li><li><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Anatolian-languages/Palaic"><strong>Palaic</strong></a> – attested in cuneiform tablets in Bronze Age Hattusa – circa the 16th century BC;</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian%5Flanguage"><strong>Egyptian</strong></a> – its earliest known complete written sentence has been dated to about 2690 BC;</li><li><strong>Akkadian</strong> – first attested texts from around the mid-3rd-millennium BC;</li><li><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Elamite-language"><strong>Elamite</strong></a> – the earliest Elamite writings use a pictographic script and date from the middle of the 3rd millennium BC;</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anitta"><strong>Hittite</strong></a> – the oldest known text in the Hittite language was written by Anitta, a king that reigned in the 17th century BC;</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear%5FB"><strong>Mycenaean Greek</strong></a> – the most ancient attested form of the Greek language with the earliest writings dating back to 1450 BC.</li></ul><h2 id="10-oldest-living-languages-in-the-world"><a href="#10-oldest-living-languages-in-the-world" class="headerlink" title="10 oldest living languages in the world"></a>10 oldest living languages in the world</h2><p> The same as everything else in the world, languages have a life cycle. They are born, then grow, sometimes mutate and eventually die. Still, there are languages on Earth that have been on people’s lips for thousands of years and continue to exist to this day.</p><p>Here are some of the oldest languages in the world still spoken today.</p><h3 id="Sanskrit-cc-3500-years-old"><a href="#Sanskrit-cc-3500-years-old" class="headerlink" title="Sanskrit (cc. 3500 years old)"></a>Sanskrit (cc. 3500 years old)</h3><p><strong>First attested:</strong> 2nd millennium BC</p><p><strong>Spoken in:</strong> India</p><p><strong>Current number of speakers:</strong> 5 million</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.ethnologue.com/language/san" >Sanskrit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was the lingua franca of ancient and medieval India and the first written record of it can be found in Rigveda, a collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns.</p><p> Although many believe Sanskrit to be an extinct language, 24,800 people have registered Sanskrit as their mother tongue at the 2011 census. Additionally, it continues to be used as a ceremonial and ritual language in Hinduism and some Buddhist practices.</p><h3 id="Greek-cc-3400-years-old"><a href="#Greek-cc-3400-years-old" class="headerlink" title="Greek (cc. 3400 years old)"></a>Greek (cc. 3400 years old)</h3><p><strong>First attested:</strong> 1450 BC.</p><p><strong>Spoken in:</strong> Greece, southern Italy</p><p><strong>Current number of speakers:</strong> 13 million</p><p> Greek was also mentioned in the “extinct languages” category because Mycenaean Greek is the precursor of Modern Greek. Thus, it’s debatable whether the Greek language we speak today is indeed 3400 years old or not. However, since its roots lie in Mycenaean Greek, we can all agree that Greek is indeed one of the oldest living languages in the world.</p><p> The Greek language holds an important place in history thanks to its rich literature that includes epic poems such as_Iliad_ and_Odyssey_ . Additionally, Greek is also the language in which many of the fundamental works in astronomy, mathematics, logic and philosophy (the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle) are composed.</p><h3 id="Coptic-Egyptian-cc-2200-years-old"><a href="#Coptic-Egyptian-cc-2200-years-old" class="headerlink" title="Coptic Egyptian (cc. 2200 years old)"></a>Coptic Egyptian (cc. 2200 years old)</h3><p><strong>First attested:</strong> 2nd century BC</p><p><strong>Spoken in:</strong> Egypt</p><p> <strong>Current number of <a class="link"   href="https://cambridgelibrarycollection.wordpress.com/2011/01/24/coptic-%E2%80%93-living-or-dead/" >speakers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> :</strong> unknown</p><p> Sometime in the 2nd century BC, Egyptian began to be written in the Coptic alphabet (an adaptation of the Greek alphabet), so the Coptic language can be considered the latest stage of the Egyptian language.</p><p> Unfortunately, the language will probably soon become extinct since there are only a few people left in the world who continue to <a class="link"   href="https://dailynewsegypt.com/2005/12/10/coptic-languages-last-survivors/" >use Coptic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as their day-to-day vernacular.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/first-language-960x640.jpg"                      alt="&#39;First language&#39; by NEOM©" title="The First &Amp; Oldest Languages Ever Spoken: Origins Of Human Communication 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036481/19272" target="_top" id="2036481">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036481" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036481/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Hebrew-cc-3000-years-old"><a href="#Hebrew-cc-3000-years-old" class="headerlink" title="Hebrew (cc. 3000 years old)"></a>Hebrew (cc. 3000 years old)</h3><p><strong>First attested:</strong> 10th century BCE</p><p><strong>Spoken in:</strong> Israel</p><p><strong>Current number of speakers:</strong> 9.3 million</p><p> The earliest known precursor to <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew%5Flanguage" >Hebrew <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the <a class="link"   href="https://dailynewsegypt.com/2005/12/10/coptic-languages-last-survivors/" >Khirbet Qeiyafa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> inscription in Ancient Hebrew discovered in 2007, near the Israeli city of Beit Shemesh, 30 km from Jerusalem.</p><p> The fascinating thing about <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Hebrew <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is that it had ceased to be an everyday spoken language somewhere between 200 and 400 AD.

After all, that’s the Italian way. You don’t really speak Italian if you don’t use <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >gestures <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . That is, if you’re not flirting through Tinder, Bumble or any other dating app. If that’s the case, you can rely solely on the charm of your written words to win hearts. Either way, the following list of Italian pick up lines are cheesy enough to work in both cases.</p><p> Before we get on with it, one question remains: are Italians as romantic as they are depicted in popular culture? Well, in a way, yes. Italian men are quite often passionate and romantic, but Italian women are usually not too fond of excessive sweetness from strangers. However, they do love a good joke. And that’s exactly where pick up lines come in!</p><p> <em>Roses are red; violets are blue, we made this<strong>Italian pick up lines</strong> list only for you.</em> 😏</p><h2 id="Funny-Pick-Up-Lines-in-Italian"><a href="#Funny-Pick-Up-Lines-in-Italian" class="headerlink" title="Funny Pick Up Lines in Italian"></a>Funny Pick Up Lines in Italian</h2><ul><li><em>Eccomi, scusa per il ritardo, è molto che mi aspetti?</em> (“Here I am, sorry I’m late, have you been waiting long?”)</li><li><em>Sto scrivendo un libro di numeri telefonici.

I love my job and I always research the best tools and strategies available to catch my students’ attention – even though that may sometimes mean to resort to technology. And I say “resort to” because I know some of us condemn the use of modern tech like apps in the classroom (I’ll get back to that later). But as I found out in my 4 years as a teacher, not all technology is bad. After doing some extensive research I discovered some of<strong>the best apps for teachers</strong> and I want to share them all with you.</p><p> Back to what I said about “resorting to” apps or other types of tech in the classroom – yes, technology might not always be our best friend. Black Mirror, Netflix’s star show, emphasizes superbly that aspect, but whether we like it or not, technology is incredibly smart! It can help teachers everywhere teach better, smarter and faster. It doesn’t have to replace us, but it can support our work with<strong>clever educational apps for teachers</strong> that are willing to adapt and improve their teaching style – teachers like you or me.</p><p> Since we are here, I figured it would be best to classify my recommendations into two major categories –<strong>best apps for teaching</strong> and<strong>best apps for learning</strong> – and then take it from there.</p><h2 id="Best-apps-for-teaching"><a href="#Best-apps-for-teaching" class="headerlink" title="Best apps for teaching"></a>Best apps for teaching</h2><p> If you want to upgrade your teaching style in order to get closer to your elementary or secondary school students and win their interest and attention, I absolutely recommend researching some<strong>school apps for teachers.</strong> It won’t only help you; it will also make you look cooler in your students’ eyes. You know how teenagers’ minds work.</p><p> But don’t overdo it. If surrender yourself with software for teachers and countless tech solutions, it might be too much in the end. I used to work a full-time job at a multinational company before becoming a teacher and the managers insisted on working with one-page reports, project management apps, smaller Excel reports and daily reports on Slack. Honestly, I got lost. It was too much. That is why you have to focus on the basics. You don’t want “fancy”. You want “useful”. So here they are:<strong>the best educational apps for teachers.</strong></p><h2 id="1-mondlyWORKS"><a href="#1-mondlyWORKS" class="headerlink" title="**1. mondlyWORKS"></a>**1. mondlyWORKS</h2><p> I will recommend <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the “best apps for learning” category too, but its integrative B2B platform also makes it one of<strong>the best educational apps for teachers</strong> –<strong>foreign language teachers</strong> especially.</p><p> Its principle is simple: the same way we share apps to watch movies we can now share Mondly to learn languages. As a teacher, we get access to a dedicated dashboard where you can manage, invite new users, see their statistics and track their progress.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/apps-for-foreign-language-teachers-1024x317.png"                      alt="apps for foreign language teachers" title="The 5 Best Apps For Language Teachers 2"                ></p><p> mondlyWORKS in a nutshell</p><p> The platform includes all the language learning experiences Mondly has created so far: the main app, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyKbKqeOX78" >Augmented Reality module <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1272636489423125/?locale=en_US" >Mondly VR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – the virtual reality app for learning languages and <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.kids.languages&hl=en" >Mondly Kids <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – the language learning app for kids and toddlers.

Slack"></a>**2. Slack</h2><p> You definitely need to communicate with both the students and their parents and Facebook is not the right place for it. Lately, I noticed that more and more teachers use Facebook groups for communication, but Slack is much more appropriate given the fact that Facebook is a place where personal stories and photos get shared.</p><p> Besides, if you are not a high school teacher, you’ll probably need a different communication channel since teens are allowed on Facebook only after the age of 13.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/teacher-parent-communication-app-1024x690.png"                      alt="teacher parent communication app" title="The 5 Best Apps For Language Teachers 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137972/21526" target="_top" id="2137972">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137972" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137972/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Screenshot of Slack</p><p> With Slack, you can create different “workspaces” for every group of students and their parents, communicate with the whole group at once or individually, give feedback, share reminders and homework to make sure everyone is up to date or use integrations such as Google+ Hangouts, Google Docs, and Google Calendar to share documents or set video call meetings with the parents. Very complex and helpful, but at the same easy to use – I can assure you.</p><h2 id="3-TrackCC"><a href="#3-TrackCC" class="headerlink" title="3. TrackCC"></a>3. <strong>TrackCC</strong></h2><p> I did a lot of research for this one, I must admit. The first two are not necessarily dedicated apps for teachers, but rather general apps that teachers successfully use in their activity. And that was completely intentional. I believe that we sometimes like to overcomplicate things, but why use a dedicated app for parent-teacher communication when you can use Slack – an easy app that most parents already have access to?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/attendance-app-for-teachers.png"                      alt="attendance app for teachers" title="The 5 Best Apps For Language Teachers 4"                ></p><p> TrackCC in a nutshell</p><p> Back to TrackCC – this is still not the perfect<strong>grading and attendance app</strong> I was looking for because of its somehow dull design, but the fact that it works is more important right now. While doing the initial research I found some grading apps for teachers that did not include the “attendance” feature and vice-versa. So TrackCC is really good because it includes both, it is intuitive and allows you, as a teacher, to keep track of grades and attendance and share them all in real time with both student and parents.</p><h2 id="4-Youtube"><a href="#4-Youtube" class="headerlink" title="**4. Youtube"></a>**4. Youtube</h2><p> You probably didn’t expect this one, but <strong>Youtube can actually be of the best educational tools for teachers</strong> if you know how to make the most of it.</p><p> If you’ll do some research on your area of interest, you’ll soon discover a lot of great content to share with your students. Ask them to watch the videos at home – or during class if they are shorter – and then discuss the topic, ask questions, give feedback and keep them involved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/educational-apps-for-teachers-1024x524.png"                      alt="educational apps for teachers" title="The 5 Best Apps For Language Teachers 5"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130869/7443" target="_top" id="2130869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Screenshot of Youtube</p><p> Just test this theory on the Youtube educational channel <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q" >“Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  and see how your students react to your new learning strategy.</p><h2 id="5-Google-Earth"><a href="#5-Google-Earth" class="headerlink" title="**5. Google Earth"></a>**5. Google Earth</h2><p> I don’t know about your school, but there are countless educational institutions around the world that still use the good, ol’ paper map. That’s not necessarily bad, but Google Earth is a free service that looks absolutely amazing. And this is not just about the students. If I’d be a Geography teacher I’d love to use Google Earth. Is one thing to identify Mount Everest on a paper map and another to see it in the Google Earth app. Just look at this:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/school-apps-for-teachers-960x529.png"                      alt="school apps for teachers" title="The 5 Best Apps For Language Teachers 6"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037355/7443" target="_top" id="2037355">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037355" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037355/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Screenshot of Google Earth</p><p> And that is not applicable only for Geography, but also for Biology or Physics.

But this can change. Whether you are a student who’s been struggling with Latin for a while now or even a teacher trying to make Latin fun in the classroom, I have good news: <strong>Latin made a comeback and is now super trendy, fun and easy to learn for students of all ages!</strong></p><p> I know you are excited. I am too. “How is this even possible?” – you’ll ask. Well, here’s a hint: brilliant minds invented very cool and immensely useful pieces of software called “language learning apps” that can make language learning fun. The problem is that most language learning apps ignore Latin. But not this one. This <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5440&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5440?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=la&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5440?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=la" >language learning app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will change the way we learn Latin forever.

I’ve been there too. I hated Latin when I was in high school. I could not see the point of learning a dead language.</p><p> But then, in the 12th grade, our teacher retired and another young and dedicated Latin teacher replaced her. It was, of course, too late for me to become fluent in Latin in just one semester. But I learned a few things.</p><p> First of all, I learned that I did not hate Latin. I later found out I was actually fascinated by it, but the previous teacher did not know how to properly teach and instil passion in me or my colleagues.</p><p> Second of all, I also learned that Latin is not a dead language. On the contrary! Latin is very much alive in our everyday conversations.<em>Carpe diem!</em></p><p> Finally, in addition to some actual Latin words, expressions and verb conjugations, I also learned that I should give Latin a second chance.</p><p> And I did. Seven years later. Or better said – a few months ago when <a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875"><strong>Mondly introduced a new Latin course</strong></a> that allowed me to enjoy learning Latin and even<strong>speak Latin like a total pro.</strong></p><p>Here’s how.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016148/19272" target="_top" id="2016148">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016148" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016148/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Veni-vidi-vici"><a href="#Veni-vidi-vici" class="headerlink" title="Veni, vidi, vici"></a>Veni, vidi, vici</h2><p> “I came; I saw; I conquered” – that’s exactly what happened when I started learning Latin with Mondly. And you know what? It took me about 5 minutes to fall in love with Latin in Mondly. It’s so fun it becomes addictive!

Mondly is just as fun. You’ll swipe up and down, select the right answer, arrange letters into words and words into sentences, use your voice to repeat the correct pronunciation of certain phrases and earn points for every completed lesson.</p><p> While most language learning apps ignore Latin because it is a dead language, <strong>Mondly thought of you and everything you go through to get those Latin grades up.</strong></p><p> And isn’t it obvious? Young people love technology and the way it makes everything easier and smarter. Why not take the drudgery of learning Latin in school and change it into something fun that all young people will love?

Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Especially in Italy where the people are so warm and friendly! Just a simple <a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875"><strong>hello in Italian</strong></a> , like_Ciao_ ,<em>Buongiorno</em> or_Salve,_ can make all the difference in a conversation with an Italian native. Maybe add a_bacio sulla guancia_ (kiss on the cheek) to that if it is appropriate and they will absolutely love you! And don’t think that this is just “an Italian thing”. No. Your attempt to speak the local language will surely be regarded as a sign of respect everywhere you go in the world. So get your greetings on point before traveling to a foreign country. You never get a second chance to make a good first impression!</p><h2 id="1-How-to-say-“hello”-in-Italian"><a href="#1-How-to-say-“hello”-in-Italian" class="headerlink" title="1. How to say “hello” in Italian"></a>1. How to say “hello” in Italian</h2><p><em>Ciao</em> is undeniably the most common Italian greeting. In fact, I’d say it is universal and used in many countries between friends as a joke. Together, of course, with_Capisce_ (“Do you understand?”). We all use_Capisce_ and_Buongiorno_ (“<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Good morning <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> “) when we want to summon our inner Italians, don’t we? Hahaha!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/HPZubh6ApHpN6/giphy.gif"                      alt="italian" title="How To Say Hello In Italian: Top 10 Italian Greetings 2"                ></p><p> But there’s more to<strong>Italian greetings</strong> than just_Ciao_ . Let’s discover the best ways to<strong>say hello in Italian</strong> and how it is appropriate to use them, depending on the social context you are in.</p><h3 id="Hello-in-Italian-–-Salve"><a href="#Hello-in-Italian-–-Salve" class="headerlink" title="Hello in Italian – Salve!"></a><strong>Hello in Italian – Salve!</strong></h3><p> The Italian culture is renowned for its deep respect for the elderly. That is why you should always be a bit more formal in one-to-one interactions with older people or with people you don’t personally know. In this kind of situation, you can safely use_Salve._ To put it into perspective,<em>Ciao</em> is the Italian equivalent of “Hi” while_Salve_ is the equivalent of “Hello”.</p><h3 id="Hi-in-Italian-–-Ciao"><a href="#Hi-in-Italian-–-Ciao" class="headerlink" title="Hi in Italian – Ciao!"></a><strong>Hi in Italian – Ciao!</strong></h3><p> Definitely, your best choice for an informal situation,<em>Ciao,</em> derived from the Venetian phrase_S-ciào vostro_ or_S-ciào su,_ literally meaning “I am your slave”. However, the expression was not to be taken literally. Its real meaning was rather a promise of goodwill among friends (the same “at your service” was used in English).</p><p> The phrase was later shortened to_Ciào_ , lost its servile connotations, and started being used as an informal greeting by all people regardless of their class.</p><p> Moving on to other ways to<strong>say hello in Italian</strong> , if you want to greet a group of friends, you can also say**<em>Ciao a tutti</em>** which means “Hello everybody”. Depending on your relationship with the members of the group you are greeting, you can also say**<em>Salve a tutti</em>** or you can greet each and every one of them differently.</p><p> In Italy, it is also possible to hear children say_Ciao-ciao,_ which is the cuter version of_Ciao_ and it translates to “Bye-bye”.</p><h2 id="2-Italian-greetings-for-certain-moments-of-the-day"><a href="#2-Italian-greetings-for-certain-moments-of-the-day" class="headerlink" title="2. Italian greetings for certain moments of the day"></a>2. Italian greetings for certain moments of the day</h2><p><strong>Good morning in Italian</strong> –<em>Buongiorno!</em> (it can also be used as a goodbye)<br><strong>Good afternoon in Italian</strong> –<em>Buon pomeriggio!</em><br><strong>Good evening in Italian</strong> –<em>Buonasera!</em> (it can also be used as a goodbye)<br><strong>Good night in Italian</strong> –<em>Buonanotte!</em> (it isn’t used only as a bedtime expression. Italians say_Buonanotte_ when they meet someone in the late evening.)<br> All four of these greetings are safe to use in any kind of formal or informal interaction.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135398/19272" target="_top" id="2135398">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135398" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135398/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-How-to-say-“goodbye-”in-Italian"><a href="#3-How-to-say-“goodbye-”in-Italian" class="headerlink" title="3. How to say “goodbye ”in Italian"></a><strong>3. How to say</strong> “<strong>goodbye</strong> ”<strong>in Italian</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Arrivederci</em></strong> is the most common way to say<strong>“goodbye” in Italian.</strong> The same as_Ciao_ , it can be used safely in all kinds of social contexts (formal or informal).<br> However, you should note that, depending on when you say it,<em>Ciao</em> can also mean “Goodbye”. So yeah, it’s now safe to say that_Ciao_ is an all-purpose greeting.<br> On the other hand, if you want to say goodbye, let’s say, to_la nonna della famiglia_ (the grandmother of the family), you’ll want to be a bit more formal than_Arrivederci_ . In that situation,<em>Arrivederla</em> is recommended.</p><p> Want more? Here are other ways to say goodbye in Italian that are suitable for both formal and informal situations:</p><ul><li>See you later. –<em>A dopo.</em></li><li>See you in a bit. –<em>A fra poco.</em></li><li>See you tomorrow. –<em>A domani.</em></li><li>See you soon. –<em>A presto.</em></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983539">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983539.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983539">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983539.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983539%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983539/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Other-basic-Italian-phrases-that-you-should-know"><a href="#4-Other-basic-Italian-phrases-that-you-should-know" class="headerlink" title="4.

Don’t believe us? Well, hear this! If you are familiar enough, the Italians will even give you an_bacio sulla guancia_ (kiss on the cheek). Careful though! Not every social interaction calls for a cheek kiss. So don’t take the first step yet.

According to the Foreign Service Institute of the US Government, a native English speaker would need around 2200 hours or 88 weeks of study to reach fluency in Korean. Now that may seem like a lot, but there are ways to make learning enjoyable.<strong>Let’s see what is the best way to learn Korean online!</strong></p><h2 id="1-Learn-Korean-words-daily-with-Mondly"><a href="#1-Learn-Korean-words-daily-with-Mondly" class="headerlink" title="1.

Especially when it came to languages such as Korean – languages that are not exactly the easiest to learn by a native English speaker.</p><p> But with the rise of language learning apps such as <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-3598&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-3598?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ko&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-3598?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ko" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , everything has changed. <strong>Now you can learn Korean online in just 5 or 10 minutes a day and fit more valuable information in one week with Mondly than in one semester of Korean classes with a teacher.</strong> And you know what? You can get a <a href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-3598&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-3598?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ko&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-3598?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ko"><strong>LIFETIME</strong> Mondly Premium membership</a> at the bargain price of<strong>ONE CLASS</strong> with a Korean teacher.</p><p> Imagine trying to master Korean pronunciation as an English speaker. If you don’t actively live in South Korea, it can be really tricky to master Korean. And choosing the right curriculum… That’s another headache altogether! But with Mondly, the award-winning language learning app, you can become conversational in no time if you practice Korean daily.</p><p> Featuring bite-sized Daily Lessons, practical topics and authentic Korean conversations recorded by fluent voice artists so you can tackle day-to-day situations, Mondly is the main and the best way to learn Korean online.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-3598&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-3598?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ko&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-3598?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ko" >Download the app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , start practicing daily for 5-10 minutes a day and soon enough you’ll find yourself speaking Korean like you never knew you could. How so? Well, Mondly doesn’t waste your time with unnecessary information that won’t get you conversational. Instead, it focuses on getting you fluent in Korean using the inductive method – learn by doing, context and example, and extrapolate to rules.</p><p> So what are you waiting for?‌ Get Mondly right now and start learning Korean words you’ll actually get to use in your day-to-day conversations in Korean.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/korean-lessons-1024x682.jpg"                      alt="korean lessons" title="The Best Way To Learn Korean Online - 6 Brilliant Resources 2"                ></p><p> “Temple in Seoul, South Korea” by Brady Bellini©</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983539">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983539.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983539">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983539.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983539%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983539/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Watch-Korean-Movies"><a href="#2-Watch-Korean-Movies" class="headerlink" title="2. Watch Korean Movies"></a>2. Watch Korean Movies</h2><p> Has it ever happened to you to spend time in a foreign country and then hear people at home speak the language of the country you visited? Strangely enough, your brain is so smart it just accommodates to the sounds you hear. It creates expectations and when these expectations are not met, it “recalibrates” to hear the right sounds. The process happens so fast that some of the times you won’t realize, but it’s always there.</p><p> So why not use the brilliance of your brain into your own advantage? <strong>Why not create a medium where you can hear Korean on a daily or at least weekly basis?</strong> For example, you could watch Korean movies**.** Given the fact that South Korea isn’t short of amazing movies, you’ll surely have a great time getting your brain used to the Korean language. In fact, some of the best movies ever made were Korean.<a class="link"   href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/" >“Oldboy” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0353969/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1" >“Memories of Murder” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2625030/?ref_=nv_sr_4?ref_=nv_sr_4" >“New World” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1" >“Parasite” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are just a few of them.</p><h2 id="3-Learn-Hangul-the-Korean-alphabet"><a href="#3-Learn-Hangul-the-Korean-alphabet" class="headerlink" title="3.

This way, the learning process will make more sense and it will become easier.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://oneplusfr.sjv.io/c/5597632/1622438/14044" target="_top" id="1622438">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14044-1622438" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://oneplusfr.sjv.io/i/5597632/1622438/14044"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Explore-a-Korean-dictionary"><a href="#4-Explore-a-Korean-dictionary" class="headerlink" title="4.

The whole process is indeed more time-consuming than learning a <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >romance language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (for example), but it’s not impossible. Depending on your objective – to learn enough Korean to talk to other people during your trip to South Korea or to master it to perfection because you want to work there – you can adapt the amount of work you’ll need to do in order to reach the corresponding level of Korean you’ll need.</p><p> The bottom line is that you can learn Korean online, at home, without paying someone thousands of dollars to help you. Mondly and a Korean dictionary such as <a class="link"   href="https://endic.naver.com/search.nhn?sLn=en&isOnlyViewEE=N&query=learn" >Naver <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are everything you need to learn Korean online without a teacher.</p><p> Always keep a Korean dictionary at hand – not necessarily Naver, but whichever you like – and search for relevant words throughout the day: “chair”, “office”, “colleagues”, “street”, “coffee” and so on. Maybe you won’t remember it the first time, but you know what they say: third time’s a charm!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123508/26400" target="_top" id="2123508">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123508" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123508/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Use-flashcards-for-those-Korean-words-that-won’t-stick"><a href="#5-Use-flashcards-for-those-Korean-words-that-won’t-stick" class="headerlink" title="5. Use flashcards for those Korean words that won’t stick"></a>5. Use flashcards for those Korean words that won’t stick</h2><p> We all have some stubborn words that just won’t stick. They don’t necessarily need to be in a foreign language. Sometimes we get this kind of “slip of the tongue” moment even in our native tongues.</p><p> Luckily, flashcards can help a great deal in this situation. Identify these “stubborn” Korean words, write them on sticky notes – so they’ll stick both literally and figuratively – and put them by the bed, in the bathroom, in the kitchen or wherever you spend the most time during a day. Next thing you know, the very same words that didn’t seem to stick, will now follow you everywhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/learn-korean-online-1024x683.jpg"                      alt="learn korean online" title="The Best Way To Learn Korean Online - 6 Brilliant Resources 3"                ></p><p> “Nights in South Korea” by Steven Roe©</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983473">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983473.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983473">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983473.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983473%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983473/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-The-best-way-to-learn-Korean-explore-Hallyu"><a href="#6-The-best-way-to-learn-Korean-explore-Hallyu" class="headerlink" title="6.

According to the Foreign Service Institute of the US Government, a native English speaker would need around 2200 hours or 88 weeks of study to reach fluency in Korean. Now that may seem like a lot, but there are ways to make learning enjoyable.<strong>Let’s see what is the best way to learn Korean online!</strong></p><h2 id="1-Learn-Korean-words-daily-with-Mondly"><a href="#1-Learn-Korean-words-daily-with-Mondly" class="headerlink" title="1.

Especially when it came to languages such as Korean – languages that are not exactly the easiest to learn by a native English speaker.</p><p> But with the rise of language learning apps such as <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-3598&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-3598?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ko&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-3598?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ko" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , everything has changed. <strong>Now you can learn Korean online in just 5 or 10 minutes a day and fit more valuable information in one week with Mondly than in one semester of Korean classes with a teacher.</strong> And you know what? You can get a <a href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-3598&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-3598?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ko&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-3598?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ko"><strong>LIFETIME</strong> Mondly Premium membership</a> at the bargain price of<strong>ONE CLASS</strong> with a Korean teacher.</p><p> Imagine trying to master Korean pronunciation as an English speaker. If you don’t actively live in South Korea, it can be really tricky to master Korean. And choosing the right curriculum… That’s another headache altogether! But with Mondly, the award-winning language learning app, you can become conversational in no time if you practice Korean daily.</p><p> Featuring bite-sized Daily Lessons, practical topics and authentic Korean conversations recorded by fluent voice artists so you can tackle day-to-day situations, Mondly is the main and the best way to learn Korean online.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-3598&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-3598?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ko&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-3598?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ko" >Download the app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , start practicing daily for 5-10 minutes a day and soon enough you’ll find yourself speaking Korean like you never knew you could. How so? Well, Mondly doesn’t waste your time with unnecessary information that won’t get you conversational. Instead, it focuses on getting you fluent in Korean using the inductive method – learn by doing, context and example, and extrapolate to rules.</p><p> So what are you waiting for?‌ Get Mondly right now and start learning Korean words you’ll actually get to use in your day-to-day conversations in Korean.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/korean-lessons-1024x682.jpg"                      alt="korean lessons" title="The Best Way To Learn Korean Online - 6 Brilliant Resources 2"                ></p><p> “Temple in Seoul, South Korea” by Brady Bellini©</p><h2 id="2-Watch-Korean-Movies"><a href="#2-Watch-Korean-Movies" class="headerlink" title="2. Watch Korean Movies"></a>2. Watch Korean Movies</h2><p> Has it ever happened to you to spend time in a foreign country and then hear people at home speak the language of the country you visited? Strangely enough, your brain is so smart it just accommodates to the sounds you hear. It creates expectations and when these expectations are not met, it “recalibrates” to hear the right sounds. The process happens so fast that some of the times you won’t realize, but it’s always there.</p><p> So why not use the brilliance of your brain into your own advantage? <strong>Why not create a medium where you can hear Korean on a daily or at least weekly basis?</strong> For example, you could watch Korean movies**.** Given the fact that South Korea isn’t short of amazing movies, you’ll surely have a great time getting your brain used to the Korean language. In fact, some of the best movies ever made were Korean.<a class="link"   href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/" >“Oldboy” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0353969/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1" >“Memories of Murder” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2625030/?ref_=nv_sr_4?ref_=nv_sr_4" >“New World” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1" >“Parasite” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are just a few of them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880960/19272" target="_top" id="1880960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880960/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Learn-Hangul-the-Korean-alphabet"><a href="#3-Learn-Hangul-the-Korean-alphabet" class="headerlink" title="3.

This way, the learning process will make more sense and it will become easier.</p><h2 id="4-Explore-a-Korean-dictionary"><a href="#4-Explore-a-Korean-dictionary" class="headerlink" title="4. Explore a Korean dictionary"></a>4. Explore a Korean dictionary</h2><p> Learning Korean should be considered a personal triumph. Throughout your study, don’t ever forget that. The whole process is indeed more time-consuming than learning a <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >romance language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (for example), but it’s not impossible. Depending on your objective – to learn enough Korean to talk to other people during your trip to South Korea or to master it to perfection because you want to work there – you can adapt the amount of work you’ll need to do in order to reach the corresponding level of Korean you’ll need.</p><p> The bottom line is that you can learn Korean online, at home, without paying someone thousands of dollars to help you. Mondly and a Korean dictionary such as <a class="link"   href="https://endic.naver.com/search.nhn?sLn=en&isOnlyViewEE=N&query=learn" >Naver <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are everything you need to learn Korean online without a teacher.</p><p> Always keep a Korean dictionary at hand – not necessarily Naver, but whichever you like – and search for relevant words throughout the day: “chair”, “office”, “colleagues”, “street”, “coffee” and so on. Maybe you won’t remember it the first time, but you know what they say: third time’s a charm!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144282/7443" target="_top" id="2144282">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144282" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144282/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Use-flashcards-for-those-Korean-words-that-won’t-stick"><a href="#5-Use-flashcards-for-those-Korean-words-that-won’t-stick" class="headerlink" title="5.

Powered by chatbot technology, the virtual teacher takes learning a step further by engaging you in conversations, giving instant feedback on pronunciation.</p><p> To create the experience, we worked in close collaboration with Google for the past 6 months.</p><p>Here’s a video showcasing Mondly AR:</p><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><h2 id="We-take-learning-out-of-the-books-and-bring-it-to-life-into-your-living-room-using-augmented-reality"><a href="#We-take-learning-out-of-the-books-and-bring-it-to-life-into-your-living-room-using-augmented-reality" class="headerlink" title="We take learning out of the books and bring it to life into your living room using augmented reality"></a>We take learning out of the books and bring it to life into your living room using augmented reality</h2><p> The new experience we created helps you develop a strong sense of the language you want to learn through highly realistic visual lessons and purposeful conversations. This approach is aiming to stimulate you to learn languages not because you have to, but because <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >it’s genuinely fun. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ckAvyr8RNxvc0Tbued/giphy.gif"                      alt="AUGMENTED REALITY LION" title="Introducing The First Augmented Reality Language App With Speech Recognition 2"                ></p><p> Mondly, the lifelike language learning assistant uses augmented reality to bring language lessons to life. She has the ability to make planets, animals and musical instruments magically appear into your own environment, creating a scenery where you can walk up and around these virtual creations and even interact with them. This spatial interaction creates a truly immersive experience which was made possible using the latest augmented reality technologies such as ARCore from Google.</p><p> Just as futuristic, the chatbot experience from Mondly aims to be the closest thing to a real interaction. Mondly understands spoken language, replies with a human voice, changes her outfit to match the topic of discussion and uses gestures and facial expressions to create dynamic dialogues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5eF84ByiI55ql9Xyrk/giphy.gif"                      alt="AR Mondly Languages" title="Introducing The First Augmented Reality Language App With Speech Recognition 3"                ></p><p>Alex Iliescu, our CEO, spoke about the launch:</p><blockquote><p><em>We started working on Mondly AR in August 2017 and by the time <a class="link"   href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856101/" >Blade Runner 2049 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was released, we already had a working demo. Watching Blade Runner 2049 made me realize that we were beginning to build the future. To me, Joi (the holographic companion of officer K) looked like a super advanced version of Mondly – the character we were creating. They can both understand speech, reply with a human voice and change outfits. Of course, Mondly is not as smart and realistic as Joi. Yet. But she can teach you 7 languages. And this is just the beginning.</em></p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037338/7443" target="_top" id="2037338">  <img

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Grammar-Gap-Understanding-Por-Que-and-Por-Que"><a href="#The-Grammar-Gap-Understanding-Por-Que-and-Por-Que" class="headerlink" title="The Grammar Gap: Understanding Por Que and Por Qué"></a>The Grammar Gap: Understanding Por Que and Por Qué</h2><p><strong><em>Porque</em></strong> vs**<em>por que</em>** and**<em>porqué</em>** vs <strong><em>por qué</em> :</strong> the real Clash of the Titans, the ultimate mystery of our world. What’s the difference and how do you correctly use all these_p_ <em>orques</em> in Spanish? Well, buckle up because today you are finally going to find out and, most importantly, glue into your brain for eternity, the answers you’ve been looking for.</p><p> Essentially, <strong><em>porque, por que, porqué</em> and_por qué_</strong>  are all<strong>pronounced the same</strong> (with some minor differences related to emphasis), but they mean totally different things. While**<em>porque</em>** translates to<strong>“because”</strong> ,<strong><em>por que</em></strong> translates to<strong>“for which”</strong> , <strong><em>el</em> <em>porqué</em></strong>  to<strong>“the reason”</strong> and**<em>por qué</em>** to<strong>“why”</strong> . It’s obviously incredibly easy to change the whole meaning of a sentence with a single misplaced <strong><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Spanish accent <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</strong></p><p> If you are an English speaker, you know that’s not new. We also have our struggles with “your” and “you’re”, “whose” and “who’s”, “these” and “this”. Even if you know English to perfection, sometimes your brain just goes blank and you don’t know what’s the correct form anymore. But the <a href="https://www.rae.es/espanol-al-dia/porque-porque-por-que-por-que-0"><strong><em>porque, por que, porqué</em> and_por qué_</strong>  problem</a> seems even more complicated than that. So read on to discover rules, eloquent examples in Spanish and the correct<strong>Spanish pronunciation</strong> for each situation.</p><h2 id="1-Por-que-–-how-to-ask“-why-”-in-Spanish"><a href="#1-Por-que-–-how-to-ask“-why-”-in-Spanish" class="headerlink" title="1. Por qué – how to ask“ why?” in Spanish"></a>1. Por qué – how to ask<strong>“</strong> why?” in Spanish</h2><p> Let’s start with the two most common <em>porques:<strong>por qué</strong></em>   <strong>and_porque_ – “why?” and “because”</strong> – the question and the answer.</p><p> Although you may be confused right now with all these versions of – basically – the same word, this**<em>por qué</em>** will always be written in two words and an accent over “e” when you want to ask a question:<strong>“why?”.</strong> Let’s add the distinctive Spanish question marks and see some examples:</p><ul><li><em><strong>¿Por qué</strong> no vienes?</em> –<strong>“Why</strong> aren’t you coming?”</li><li><em><strong>¿Por qué</strong> no comes el pastel?</em> –<strong>“Why</strong> aren’t you eating the cake?”</li><li><em><strong>¿Por qué</strong> no aprendes español con Mondly?</em> –<strong>“Why</strong> don’t you learn Spanish with Mondly?”</li><li><em><strong>¿Por qué</strong> lees libros en español?</em> –<strong>“Why</strong> do you read books in Spanish?”</li></ul><p> Now let’s see some examples where**<em>por qué</em>** is used as a reported or indirect question. Here are some examples to help you understand better:</p><ul><li><em>Me preguntó<strong>por qué</strong> no leo libros en español.</em> – “He asked me<strong>why</strong> I did not read Spanish books.”</li><li><em>No sé<strong>por qué</strong> rechazaste la oferta.</em> – “I don’t know<strong>why</strong> you refused the offer.”</li><li><em>Quiero saber<strong>por qué</strong> está tan feliz.</em> – “I want to know<strong>why</strong> he&#x2F;she is so happy.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/por-que-scaled-960x554.jpg"                      alt="por que" title="Porque Vs Por Que: What&#39;S The Difference? 2"                ></p><p> “Let’s write” by Kelly Sikkema©</p><h2 id="2-Porque-–-“because”-or-how-to-give-reasons-in-Spanish"><a href="#2-Porque-–-“because”-or-how-to-give-reasons-in-Spanish" class="headerlink" title="2. Porque – “because” or how to give reasons in Spanish"></a>2. Porque – “because” or how to give reasons in Spanish</h2><p> As you already know, whenever you ask “why?” in English, the other person will probably begin their answer using “because”. Well, Spanish has the same rules: whenever you ask someone<strong>“por qué”,</strong> they will probably begin their answer with the plain and simple<strong>“porque”</strong> with no spaces and no accents. Let’s see some examples:</p><ul><li><em><strong>¿Por qué</strong> no vienes a la fiesta?<strong>Porque</strong> estoy cansado.</em> – “Why are you not coming to the party?<strong>Because</strong> I’m tired.”</li><li><em><strong>¿Por qué</strong> estás tan feliz?<strong>Porque me</strong> voy de vacaciones mañana.</em> – “Why are you so happy?<strong>Because</strong> I’m going on vacation tomorrow.”</li><li><em><strong>¿Por qué</strong> me llamaste?<strong>Porque</strong> necesitaba tu ayuda.</em>  – “Why did you call me?<strong>Because</strong> I needed your help.”</li><li><em><strong>Porque</strong> quiero mejorar mi español.</em> – “<strong>Because</strong> I want to improve my Spanish.”</li></ul><p> In other cases,<strong>“because”</strong> and<strong>“porque”</strong>  can become the subordinating conjunctions that link two clauses: the reason and the result. Let’s see some examples to help you better understand:</p><ul><li><em>No llegué a tiempo<strong>porque</strong> perdí el tren.</em> – “I didn’t make it on time<strong>because</strong> I missed the train.”</li><li><em>No me uní a la clase<strong>porque</strong> estoy aprendiendo español más rápido con Mondly.</em>  – “I didn’t join the class<strong>because</strong> I’m learning Spanish faster with Mondly.”</li></ul><p> Well, this was the easy part of the great mystery behind <strong>p_orque_ vs_por que_ .</strong> Lucky for those of us who want to<strong>learn Spanish,</strong> the simplest_porques_ are also the most frequently used.</p><p> But it’s always better to be safe and learn all the possible outcomes than learn only half of them and feel sorry afterwars. So let’s move on to the more problematic_porques:_ <strong><em>por que</em> (for which)</strong> and <strong><em>el porqué</em> (the reason)<em>.</em></strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484940/16446" target="_top" id="1484940">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484940" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484940/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Por-que-–-“For-which”"><a href="#3-Por-que-–-“For-which”" class="headerlink" title="3. Por que – “For which”"></a>3. Por que – “For which”</h2><p> The knottiest of the four_porques_ is definitely the**<em>por que</em>** that translates to<strong>“for which”.</strong> Even in English we rarely use this word arrangement in a sentence.</p><p> Let’s look at “this is the jacket for which I was looking”. That doesn’t sound exactly natural, does it? A more logical way to express the same information would be “this is the jacket I was looking for”. But Spanish can’t end a sentence with a preposition. So let’s explore the two situations where you’ll need to use<strong>“por que”.</strong></p><ul><li><em>Esta es la razón<strong>por que</strong> no vine.</em> – “This is the reason<strong>for which</strong> I didn’t come.”</li><li><em>Cual es el motivo<strong>por que</strong> te has ido?</em> – “What is the reason<strong>for which</strong> you left?”</li></ul><p> While in the original Spanish sentence_la razón por que_ can be replaced with_por la que &#x2F; por la cual,_ in the English translation, “the reason why” can always take the place of “the reason for which”. Same goes for the second example:<em>el motivo por que</em> can be replaced with_el motivo por el que &#x2F; por el cual._ In day-to-day conversations in Spanish, people are more likely to use the more natural forms:<strong><em>por la&#x2F;el que, por la&#x2F;el cual.</em></strong></p><p> Another possible situation where you’ll need to use**<em>por que</em>** is when you’ll have phrasal verbs like_abogar por_ (advocate for),<em>preocupar por</em> (worry about)‌ or_luchar por_ (fight for) followed by “que”.</p><ul><li><em>Yo estoy preocupada<strong>por que</strong> el vuelo pueda cancelarse.</em> – “I’m worried that the flight might be cancelled.”</li><li><em>La profesora aboga<strong>por que</strong> los alumnos no lleven deberes a casa.</em> – “The teacher advocates that students should not receive homework.”</li><li><em>Mi abuela se preocupa<strong>por que</strong> comamos bien.</em> – “My grandmother worries about our nutrition.”</li><li>La sociedad luchó<strong>por que</strong> las mujeres pudiesen votar. – “Society fought for women’s suffrage.”</li></ul><p>Well, now it’s all starting to make sense, doesn’t it?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/porque-or-por-que-1024x682.jpg"                      alt="learn Spanish" title="Porque Vs Por Que: What&#39;S The Difference? 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134237/18498" target="_top" id="2134237">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134237" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134237/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> “Studying” by David Iskander©</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983471">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983471.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983471">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983471.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983471%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983471/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-El-porque-–-The-reason"><a href="#4-El-porque-–-The-reason" class="headerlink" title="4. El porqué – The reason"></a>4. El porqué – The reason</h2><p> Bare with me. This is the last<strong>“porqué”</strong> and the easiest<strong>“porqué”.</strong></p><p><strong><em>El porqué</em></strong> usually translates to<strong>“the reason”,</strong> but it can also mean<strong>“why”</strong> – used as a noun. Here’s an example from <a class="link"   href="https://simonsinek.com/find-your-why/" >Simon Sinek <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> : “Everybody has a WHY. Do you know yours?”. In Spanish, that would translate to “Todos tienen un PORQUÉ. ¿Conoces el tuyo?”. Here are a few more examples with <strong><em>el porqué</em> :</strong></p><ul><li><em>El quería saber más sobre<strong>los porqués</strong> de mi partida.</em> – He wanted to know more about<strong>the reasons</strong> for my departure.</li><li><em>Todo tiene<strong>un porqué.</strong></em>  – Everything has a reason.</li><li><em>Este buen clima es<strong>el porqué</strong> de mi felicidad.</em> – This nice weather is<strong>the reason</strong> for my happiness.</li><li><em>¿Cuál es<strong>el porqué</strong> de su elección?</em> – “What is<strong>the reason</strong> of your choice?”</li></ul><p> Officially, <strong>the four_porques_</strong>  are no longer a mystery for you.
