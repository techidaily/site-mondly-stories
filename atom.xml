Everywhere in the neighborhood smells like pumpkin pie, roasted chestnuts and mulled wine. Everyone is wearing warmer clothes and brighter smiles. Kids are carrying their heavy schoolbags back home to a delicious lunch and scary jack-o’-lanterns have begun popping up here and there. It’s glaringly obvious:<strong>Halloween is almost here!</strong> Soon enough houses will be covered in black and orange decorations and children will shout excitedly:<strong>“Trick or treat?! Give me something good to eat!”.</strong></p><h2 id="The-Origins-of-Halloween"><a href="#The-Origins-of-Halloween" class="headerlink" title="The Origins of Halloween"></a>The Origins of Halloween</h2><p> Celebrated yearly on October 31, Halloween, Hallowe’en or All Hallows’ Eve is a world-old holiday whose origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain that took place on the lands that are now Ireland, the United Kingdom, and northern France. For hundreds – or even thousands – of years, people have celebrated this holiday, but it was never as loved and as notorious as it is today.</p><p> Nevertheless, there are many countries around the world that have their own Halloween-like traditions celebrating the afterlife. For example, in some parts of the world, on All Hallows’ Eve, people visit the graveyards of their loved ones to pray and place flowers. But let’s dive in already and look at <strong>four of the most fascinating Halloween-like traditions from different corners of the world.</strong></p><h2 id="Halloween-like-Traditions-Worldwide"><a href="#Halloween-like-Traditions-Worldwide" class="headerlink" title="Halloween-like Traditions Worldwide"></a>Halloween-like Traditions Worldwide</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37701530&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6fe0c81e3f9438db11ebbfba6c5ce460/products/copy_cbLogo_with_text_blue.png"                      border="0"                >CalendarBudget - Monthly subscription membership to CalendarBudget via web browser or mobile app. Support included. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Mexico-Dia-de-Muertos-Day-of-the-Dead"><a href="#Mexico-Dia-de-Muertos-Day-of-the-Dead" class="headerlink" title="Mexico: Día de Muertos (Day of the Dead)"></a>Mexico: Día de Muertos (Day of the Dead)</h3><p> Inscribed in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity,<em>Día de los Muertos</em> is celebrated yearly on October 31, November 1, and November 2 to coincide with the celebration the Allhallowtide: All Saints’ Eve, All Saints’ Day, and All Souls’ Day.</p><p> The same as Halloween,<em>Día de Muertos</em> is a celebration of the afterlife. Friends and family gather to remember and pray for their loved ones who have died. Mexicans view death as a natural part of the human cycle and praying for someone who has died as a way of helping them in their spiritual journey. So Día de Muertos is not a day of sadness, but one of celebration and color!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/dia-de-muertos-960x639.jpg"                      alt="Colorful ofrendas and calaveras during Día de Muertos in Mexico" title="Global Halloween Celebrations: From Día De Muertos To Romania&#39;S St. Andrew&#39;S Day 6"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296855&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/recode/Nero_Recode_Screen_2.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> “Calaveras” by Valeria Almaraz©</p><p> As you probably already know, the main symbols of <a href="https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/indigenous-festivity-dedicated-to-the-dead-00054"><em>Día de Muertos</em></a> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofrenda"><em>ofrendas</em></a> (altars),<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calavera"><em>calaveras</em></a> (representations of a human skull often applied to edible or decorative skulls) and people wearing the colorful_calaveras_ makeup known all over the world.

For example, Italy has_Tutti i Morti,_ a public day celebrated on the 1st and 2nd of November by remembering and praying for the deceased.</p><p> A few days before the celebration, people visit the cemeteries so their loved ones will have fresh flowers on the grave on the day of the actual ceremonies. Then, they continue with all the other preparations involving different rituals depending on the region. For <a class="link"   href="https://www.italyheritage.com/traditions/calendar/november/ognissanti.htm" >example <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , in Puglia, Orsara, it is believed that the souls return from Purgatory, so the Orsaresi decorate the town with_cocce priatorje_ (pumpkins) that symbolize the spirits and lit bonfires to console them. In Sicily, children wake up on the morning of_Giorno dei Morti_ and find small gifts from their deceased relatives, in Abruzzo, children go door to door to ask for gifts for the souls of the dead and in Veneto, the carved pumpkins are called lumère (lanterns) or_suche dei morti_ (deads’ pumpkins) and represent the resurrection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/neonbrand-A59lWOrZVnw-unsplash-1024x682.jpg"                      alt="halloween in different countries" title="Global Halloween Celebrations: From Día De Muertos To Romania&#39;S St. Andrew&#39;S Day 8"                ></p><p> “Halloween party” by NeONBRAND©</p><p> Contrary to what you may believe, pumpkins and asking for candy and gifts are traditions of the past that were popular in many Italian regions before the American Halloween became so notorious.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Romania-Saint-Andrew’s-Day"><a href="#Romania-Saint-Andrew’s-Day" class="headerlink" title="Romania: Saint Andrew’s Day"></a>Romania: Saint Andrew’s Day</h3><p> Thanks to Dracula, Romania is now one of the most well-known Halloween destinations. Everyone dreams of partying at Dracula’s Castle. In reality, both Catholic and Orthodox churches in Romania discourage Halloween celebrations. Instead, they advocate for the celebrations of the Day of the Dead on 1 November, when special religious ceremonies are held for the souls of the deceased.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/draculas-castle-1024x682.jpg"                      alt="dracula&#39;s castle" title="Global Halloween Celebrations: From Día De Muertos To Romania&#39;S St. Andrew&#39;S Day 9"                ></p><p> “Dracula’s Castle in Romania” by Nomadic Julien©</p><p> It is said that on St. Andrew’s Eve, ghosts roam freely between the living and people must protect their homes using garlic, a symbol that is now also related to scaring off vampires. Thus, to this day, especially old people from the countryside, rub the doors and the windows with garlic to keep the bad spirits away.</p><p><strong>Did You Know?</strong></p><p> <em>Saint Andrew, for whom this day is named, is also the patron saint of Romania, Greece, and Russia. Each country has distinct customs and traditions to honor him.</em></p><p> The same as in other cultures, Romanians bring fresh flowers to the graves of their loved ones, go to the church to attend special ceremonies and offer food and drinks as it is believed the deceased can enjoy them in “The Other World”.</p><p> As October comes to an end, it’s evident that the spirit of Halloween, or the remembrance of the departed, resonates across cultures. While the customs might vary, the core sentiment remains consistent: honoring those who’ve passed and celebrating the mysteries of the afterlife</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/halloween-around-the-world/&t=Global+Halloween+Celebrations:+From+D%C3%ADa+de+Muertos+to+Romania%5C&%23039;s+St.+Andrew%5C&%23039;s+Day"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h4 id="Learn-a-new-language-and-celebrate-Halloween-abroad-this-year"><a href="#Learn-a-new-language-and-celebrate-Halloween-abroad-this-year" class="headerlink" title="Learn a new language and celebrate Halloween abroad this year"></a>Learn a new language and celebrate Halloween abroad this year</h4><p> Do you want to experience the magic of Halloween abroad?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Panneaux-Et-Jours-Semaine-en-Francais"><a href="#Panneaux-Et-Jours-Semaine-en-Francais" class="headerlink" title="Panneaux Et Jours: Semaine en Français"></a>Panneaux Et Jours: Semaine en Français</h2><p> Mastering something as essential as the<strong>days of the week in French</strong> may prove more practical than you think. Paris is always a good idea, but what if you miss your_mardi_ reservation at the #1 restaurant in Paris because you show up on_mercredi_ instead? We don’t want that to happen. That’s why it’s always best to dive into <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learning French <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by mastering the essentials first: how to say “<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >hello <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ”, “<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >you’re welcome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ” and the days of the week.</p><p> If “a day” is_un jour_ in French and “a week” is_une semaine_ , it may also be useful to know that “the days of the week” is “<em>les jours de la semaine”</em> . Now let’s see how fast you can learn all seven days of the week_en français_ .</p><h2 id="Days-of-the-week-in-French"><a href="#Days-of-the-week-in-French" class="headerlink" title="Days of the week in French"></a>Days of the week in French</h2><p>The days of the week in French are:</p><p> Show 10 25 50 100  entries</p><p> Search:</p><table><thead><tr><th>French</th><th>English</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>lundi</td><td>Monday</td></tr><tr><td>mardi</td><td>Tuesday</td></tr><tr><td>mercredi</td><td>Wednesday</td></tr><tr><td>jeudi</td><td>Thursday</td></tr><tr><td>vendredi</td><td>Friday</td></tr><tr><td>samedi</td><td>Saturday</td></tr><tr><td>dimanche</td><td>Sunday</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Showing 1 to 7 of 7 entries</p><p> Previous  Next</p><p> Easy enough, aren’t they? If you are not completely sure about the pronunciation, here’s how you’d pronounce them in English:</p><ul><li><em>lundi</em>  – “lun-dee”</li><li><em>mardi</em>  – “mar-dee”</li><li><em>mercredi</em>  – “mare-creu-dee”</li><li><em>jeudi</em>  – “zheu-dee”</li><li><em>vendredi</em>  – “von-dre-dee”</li><li><em>samedi</em>  – “sum-dee”</li><li><em>dimanche</em>  – “dee-monsh”</li></ul><p> Now repeat them a few times to make sure they stick and let’s move on to some context. Here are some useful French expressions related to time and the days of the week:</p><ul><li><em>un jour</em> – a day</li><li><em>aujourd’hui</em> – today</li><li><em>hier</em>  – yesterday</li><li><em>avant-hier</em> – the day before yesterday</li><li><em>demain</em> – tomorrow</li><li><em>après-demain</em> – the day after tomorrow</li><li><em>Quel jour est-ce ?</em> – What day is it?</li><li><em>Quel jour tombe ton anniversaire cette année ?</em> – What day is your birthday this year?</li><li><em>On peut aller au restaurant jeudi.</em> – We could go to the restaurant on Thursday.</li><li><em>Je ne travaille pas le vendredi.</em> – I don’t work on Fridays.</li><li><em>hebdomadaire</em> – weekly</li><li><em>dans trois jours</em> – in three days time</li><li><em>le week-end</em> – the weekend</li><li><em>jours ouvrables</em> – working days (Monday to Friday)</li><li><em>du lundi au vendredi</em> – from Monday to Friday</li><li><em>Le mardi est le deuxième jour de la semaine.</em> – Tuesday is the second day of the week.</li></ul><p> Planning to spend an entire week in France? Dont stop at_les jours de la semaine en français_ . French people are known to be proud of their language and heritage. Surprise them with your French skills and go beyond “Friday” in French with these <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >100+ French travel phrases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . You’ll thank me later.</p><h2 id="Usage-rules"><a href="#Usage-rules" class="headerlink" title="Usage rules"></a>Usage rules</h2><p> One more thing before you go. To make sure you are using your newly acquired French days of the week correctly, don’t forget that:</p><ul><li><p><strong>the days of the week are not capitalized in French</strong> – unless, of course, they appear at the beginning of a sentence;</p></li><li><p><strong>the French week starts on Monday;</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>days of the week are all masculine in French</strong> – this means you’ll always have to use masculine articles <em>(le</em> and <em>un)</em>  and masculine adjectives when talking about the days of the week. For example, if you want to say “the last Friday of the month was rainy” in French, you say <em>“le dernier vendredi du mois était pluvieux”;</em></p></li><li><p>in contrast to <em>le jour</em> , <a href="https://french.kwiziq.com/revision/grammar/when-to-use-an-annee-matin-matinee-jour-journee-soir-soiree-time-unit-vs-duration"><em>la journée</em></a> (which also translates to “day”) is a feminine noun that refers to a longer period of time during which something might happen. <em>Jour,</em> on the other hand, represents a precise moment, a unit of time. For example: “<em>Je te rendrai visite dans la journée”</em> (“I’ll visit you during the day”) is different from <em>“Je t’appelle dans deux jours”</em> (“I’ll call you in two days”).</p></li><li><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/days-of-the-week-in-french/&t=The+Days+of+the+Week+in+French"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></li><li><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></li></ul><hr><h4 id="From-0-to-conversational-in-French"><a href="#From-0-to-conversational-in-French" class="headerlink" title="From 0 to conversational in French"></a>From 0 to conversational in French</h4><p> Do you want to see the<strong>French weekdays</strong> in action?

The language spectrum is wider here, as opposed to Europe for example. The collection of Asian languages includes Sino -Tibetan, Austronesian, Dravidian, Altaic and countless others. By the way, English is also spoken fluently as a second language in many countries in Asia. So, if you’re planning a trip to Asia, or wishing to study there, it’s about time you found out which are the most popular Asian languages!</p><p> The list has been put together by looking at the most common languages spoken in Asia, but also the most popular Asian and Pacific Island languages popular in the US and Europe and the most popular Asian languages for business. How to learn Asian languages? <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-6345&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6345&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6345" >Mondly’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> got your back!</p><p> So, without further ado, let’s discover which are the most popular Asian languages today!</p><h2 id="1-Chinese-Mandarin"><a href="#1-Chinese-Mandarin" class="headerlink" title="1.

Mandarin is the most spoken dialect and China’s official language. It belongs to the Sino-Tibetan language family and is somewhat similar to Cantonese.</p><p> Other known dialects are Cantonese, Hokkien, Xiang, Hakka, Min, Wu, and Yue. You should know that the language has over 100.000 special characters, which are called logograms, and its speakers use four distinct tones to communicate. There is also a neutral tone and each one of the five is used in order to differentiate between words. At least, all the dialects use the same writing system, phew… Don’t worry, we’ll start you off with something easy like <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >“hello” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >“thank you” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Chinese is also the third most common foreign language in the United States, with approximately 3.4 million speakers. By the way, it’s very possible that China will become the strongest economy by 2050, so you’d better <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >start learning Chinese online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  soon. Apparently, Chinese speakers use both sides of the brain, while English speakers only use their left side.</p><h2 id="2-Hindi"><a href="#2-Hindi" class="headerlink" title="2. Hindi"></a>2.

This Indo-Aryan derived language is spoken by approximately 550 million people, including here the residents of Fiji. Written in the Devanagari script, Hindi is also spoken by some 81 million people in the US. If you are a fan of Bollywood, this is the language for you!</p><p> Coming from Sanskrit, Hindi is the fourth most-spoken native language in the world, behind Chinese, Spanish and English, and it’s also incredibly similar to Urdu. The two languages are so similar that two speakers of Urdu and Hindi can understand each other without issues! Even though it is the most popular language in India, it is not in fact the national language. This is due to the fact that the Indian constitution does not specify a national language as such. By the way, Hindi is also one of the easiest languages to learn by English speakers, so you should definitely give it a go!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4559731&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.neowise.com/images/nd-ss-w200.jpg"                      border="0"                >NeoDownloader - Fast and fully automatic image&#x2F;video&#x2F;music downloader. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Indonesian"><a href="#3-Indonesian" class="headerlink" title="3.

To be more precise, Indonesian is actually considered a dialect of Malay, with differences mainly when it comes to accent and vocabulary.</p><p> However, natives can certainly distinguish between the two with ease. Good news for the language enthusiasts, Indonesian uses Latin script, which makes it one of the least challenging Asian languages to learn. Another interesting fact is that Indonesian is the third most used language in WordPress, with an astounding 1.5 million blogs written in this language.</p><p> With 240 million speakers in Asia alone, Indonesian is actually more popular than Korean (sorry <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Squid Game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  fans) or Japanese, even though it’s hard to believe.

We combined<strong>the wizardry of virtual reality</strong> with<strong>language learning</strong> to give you a revolutionary and intuitive approach to learn languages like you never knew you could.</p><h2 id="How-does-it-work"><a href="#How-does-it-work" class="headerlink" title="How does it work?"></a>How does it work?</h2><p> Eager to<strong>practice your French or Spanish</strong> in a <strong><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >REAL‌ conversation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ?</strong> Put your VR headset on, choose an avatar, select your native language and let’s get you talking! You will be automatically assigned to a VR room together with a maximum of 11 other participants where you will socialize and practice the language you want to learn “face to face” as if you were in the same room.</p><p> Using<strong>speech recognition</strong> and<strong>intelligent suggestions</strong> accompanied by<strong>real-time translations,</strong> Mondly VR will make sure you won’t get stuck with words you can’t remember and the conversation will go seamlessly.</p><h2 id="Connect-with-people-from-all-around-the-world"><a href="#Connect-with-people-from-all-around-the-world" class="headerlink" title="Connect with people from all around the world"></a>Connect with people from all around the world</h2><p> One of the things we love most about the Multiplayer module is that it brings people together. Every new session gives you the chance to interact with people just like you: people that want to learn Spanish, French or maybe English and don’t have a conversation partner to practice conversations.</p><p> This is a unique chance to connect and learn languages together in a <strong>singular hands-on VR experience that will shape you into a better and more natural speaker.</strong></p><ul><li><a class="link"

To find out more, please visit our Cookie Policy .</li><li><strong>Indirectly</strong> from specified third parties (such as Facebook and Google) if you choose to register via a social media platform.</li></ol><p><strong>3.</strong>   <strong>What personal data do we collect from the people that visit our website or use our apps?</strong></p><ul><li>When registering on our website or using any of our products and services, including Mondly apps, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, foreign language skills, your interests, and you may provide a profile picture (this might be associated with the photo on your Facebook account if you sign up that way). For some Services, a user may register using an alias name (pseudonym) that is not otherwise associated with personal data provided to Mondly.<strong><em>Note:</em></strong> some of the apps might also include a leadership board noting username, profile pictures and points so an alias name should be provided if you are not comfortable with this being made public to other users.</li><li>We also process any other voluntary details that you can save in your profile, and your communication preferences (including if you raise a complaint and&#x2F;or support query).</li><li>We will process your login details: including username and password and similar credentials.</li><li>You may elect to record your voice practising the language (but this is optional). Further, you may elect to use our virtual reality app to practice languages in realistic dialogues inspired by events (e.g. check-in to a hotel in Paris). This might involve an element of gamification (and multi-player functionality, where your name and the information you have made available in your profile will be available).</li><li>Where you upgrade to premium and&#x2F;or buy a subscription, you will provide financial information i.e. subscription&#x2F;purchase information, card details, billing address.</li><li>We collect lesson progress and analytics, including information about how you use our services, such as the types of content that you view or engage with, the features you use, the actions you take, the other users you interact with and the time, frequency and duration of your activities. As users of the Services, learners may also record responses to interactive exercises, scores, grades or activities completed.</li><li>We also collect cookie information (where we have your permission, if required by law), log data, device information and IP addresses that help us understand which country you are connecting from to provide more personalized content better suited to your needs as a user. Please see ourCookie Policy for more information.</li><li>There is a specific MondlyKIDS app which we recommend is used by children under the age of 15 to ensure they receive an age-appropriate experience as this app can function with minimal data collection (limited to username, email address only).</li></ul><p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>What is the purpose for collecting the information?</strong></p><p> Ultimately, we collect information for the purpose of bringing you the best possible experience when using our products and services. This could include collecting your information for:</p><p> · <strong>registering your account</strong> when you create one;</p><p> ·   <strong>fulfilling the service terms when providing you with our products and services, including honouring your purchase with us and tracking purchases and progress</strong> which includes sending periodic emails about lesson reminders and to otherwise<strong>make Mondly available to you,</strong> for example, we need such information for your account ranking, connecting with other users through social media platforms, adjusting the difficulty level of the app for the user, analysing voice recordings to confirm accuracy of grammar and vocabulary, providing access to content and capturing progress within the application etc;</p><p> · <strong>authorise and authenticate users of our services</strong> (and prevent and detect fraud and&#x2F;or security breaches);</p><p> · <strong>managing leadership boards</strong> where we may publish your username, profile information including language combination, scores, online status and date of registration as well as any additional information voluntarily provided;</p><ul><li><strong>personalizing your experience</strong> and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product and service offerings in which you are most interested;</li><li><strong>marketing to you</strong> via email, in-app advertisements and&#x2F;or online marketing. <em>Please note that we do not intentionally send marketing communications to learners aged under 15 unless consent has been provided on behalf of the learners, in which case such consent may be withdrawn at any time.

We want to build a profile of you so that we can send relevant communications and market to you more effectively based on customer audience segments we create – this profiling is not considered “automated decision making” (<em>the process of making a decision with significant consequences by automated means without any human involvement</em>), but we will let you know if that changes;</p><p> · <strong>market research purposes</strong> e.g. if you respond to a survey or if we conduct data analytics. Participation in surveys and discussion forums is entirely voluntary. You may unsubscribe from being contacted for these purposes at any time;</p><p> · <strong>improving our products and services,</strong> for example through website analytics based on application and system logs data which could include data such as your IP address, internet service provider and browser type, type of computer&#x2F;device, and details of the website, application or email communication you came from before entering the Services. <em>Please note that we may, from time-to-time, supply third parties with aggregated sets of this data for uses in connection with our Services;</em></p><p> · meeting our<strong>legal, regulatory, and tax reporting obligations</strong> , including to comply with requests from local authorities and government bodies and investigating incidents of potential or suspected breaches of our terms of service or applicable laws.

This will be:</p><ul><li>when information is<strong>necessary for us to perform a contract</strong> with you (when you purchase a subscription, upgrade to premium and&#x2F;or accept our terms of use);</li><li>with your<strong>consent</strong> (e.g. we may ask you for specific consent to use your personal data in a particular way);</li><li>to comply with our<strong>legal obligations</strong> (e.g. we might have regulatory obligations to report or share or archive personal data); and&#x2F;or</li><li>for a variety of business purposes which are in our<strong>legitimate interests</strong> as a commercial provider of educational products and services to grow our brand and protect and enhance our products and services.</li></ul><p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>How long will we use your personal data</strong></p><p> We shall be storing your information as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we are processing your personal data, which may be for the entire duration of your use of our products and services or longer if the law permits or requires – unless you exercise your right to delete certain data where applicable.</p><p> In particular, we retain registration, profile, transaction, and other information for as long as a user maintains their account. Users may request deletion of their account at any time. On receipt of a deletion request, we delete data that it is not required to retain for purposes of legal, tax, accounting, reporting, insurance, litigation, or other regulatory requirements which we will retain for 6 years from collection – during which time we may also use it for purposes of security, fraud prevention and detection. We may be unable to delete a user’s account in certain circumstances, particularly if there is an outstanding credit on the account or an unresolved dispute. Upon resolution of the issue, we will delete the account as described above.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>What rights do I have?</strong></p><p>Depending on the country you are in, you may have the right to:</p><ul><li>request<strong>access</strong> to and obtain a copy of your personal data and be<strong>informed</strong> about our processing activities,</li><li><strong>rectify</strong> your personal data if it is no longer accurate,</li><li>request the<strong>erasure</strong> of your personal data if our retention is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected,</li><li><strong>restrict</strong> or<strong>object</strong> to the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances,</li><li><strong>data portability</strong> , and</li><li><strong>lodge a complaint</strong> with your relevant supervisory authority or regulator (but we ask you to contact us in the first instance).</li></ul><p> If you are resident in California, please click thislink to find out more information about your specific rights – in particular, we confirm that we don’t sell your personal data.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> <strong>How do we protect your information?</strong></p><p> At Mondly, we maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures to maintain the safety of your personal data and take steps to prevent unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss, theft, destruction of or damage to personal data.

They may have their own privacy notices for the processing that they conduct as a controller so please make sure you request this and read it).</p><p><strong><em>Other Disclosures</em></strong></p><p> We may disclose personal data or personally-identifiable information in the following circumstances:</p><ul><li>when you give us explicit consent to share your data;</li><li>when we share it with external service providers and data processors such as data centres, web hosts, cloud storage and cloud software providers, customer support providers, payment processors, debt collectors, accountants, and insurers;</li><li>when we share it with prospective sellers or buyers of our business or assets and if we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired (and their professional advisors), or in the event that we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party; and</li><li>when we are required or requested to share it with regulators, law enforcement agencies and other relevant parties for the purpose of enforcement action, legal or contractual compliance and reporting purposes, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Data transfers</em></strong></p><p> Whilst data is predominantly stored in the European Union, we are part of a global organisation and use global service providers.

Scope</strong></p><p> 1.1. The following terms and conditions (“<strong>Terms of Use</strong> “) apply between<strong>ATI STUDIOS A.P.P.S. S.R.L</strong> , with its registered office at 50A Griviței Avenue Building 15, Entrance C, 1st Floor, Apt. 1 Brașov County, Brasov, Romania (“<strong>Mondly</strong> “) and you as a user of the Mondly App with its free basic functions as well as additional paid functions selected by you by way of so-called InApp Purchases (“<strong>Order(s)”)</strong> (collectively<strong>“App”</strong>).</p><p> 1.2. The App can only be used by consumers, i.e. persons who are not acting for predominantly commercial or self-employed purposes (“<strong>users</strong> “,<strong>“you”</strong>).</p><p> 1.3. References in these Terms of Use to the applicability of statutory provisions are for clarification purposes only. As such, the statutory provisions will still apply even if not set out in these Terms of Use, unless these are supplemented or expressly excluded.</p><p><strong>2. Subject matter of performance and conclusion of contract</strong></p><p> 2.1. The Mondly App provides a language learning solution according to the available features that allow users to learn many different languages. Mondly App shall act as a tool to support users to improve language skills but does not promise that the user will reach a specific progress in learning a language.</p><p> 2.2. The user can access the App via the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store and download it to his or her device in accordance with these terms of use here, which are displayed in each case as part of the contract initiation process and must be accepted by the user before starting the download process. By clicking on the download button, the user makes an offer to conclude a contract for the use of the App, including its free basic functions, which Mondly accepts by making the App available for use on the user’s device.</p><p> 2.3. If the user wishes to expand the basic functions of the App with additional functions for which a fee is charged (“premium features”), the user must place an order in the App. Offers by Mondly for paid content are not binding. Orders placed by the user constitute a binding offer to conclude a contract for the respective premium features. By clicking on the button “Order with obligation to pay”, the user makes a binding offer to conclude a contract for the respective premium features. The user’s offer only becomes binding for both parties when Mondly actually provides the premium feature in the App.</p><p> 2.4. The user can use the App and all of its functions, regardless of whether they are paid or free of charge, without having to create a user account in the App. A user account only needs to be created if the user wishes to save their learning progress in the App.</p><p> 2.5. For a limited period of time specified in the app, Mondly may, at its own discretion, make individual additional premium features available to the user free of charge for test purposes.</p><p> 2.6. We will send you the contract, which contains the details of your order, as well as these Terms of Use in text form. For security reasons, the contract text is no longer accessible online after the contract has been concluded. Furthermore, you can access these terms of use in the App in the settings under “Info”.</p><p><strong>3. Prices and terms of payment</strong></p><p> 3.1. The user can use the App with the basic functions specified in the service description free of charge.</p><p> 3.2. For the use of the premium features of the App that go beyond the basic functions of the App, the user must pay the fees shown during the order process.</p><p> 3.3. Depending on the operating system of the user’s device, payment is made via the Apple App Store or Google Play Store account using the means of payment available there. The terms and conditions of the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store will apply in relation to this payment.</p><p> 3.4. An internet connection is required to download the app, which must be provided at the user’s own expense.</p><p><strong>4. Rights of use</strong></p><ul><li>During the term of the respective contract, Mondly grants the user the non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to use the App, including its free basic functions and any premium features, on a single mobile end device, limited to the term of the contract, exclusively for private purposes in accordance with these Terms of Use, i.e. to install it on the respective device, to copy it to the extent technically necessary for use in accordance with the contract, to load it, to display it and to run it.</li><li>Neither the App nor its respective free basic and premium features may be shared with or made available to third parties without Mondly’s prior written consent. In particular, the user may not grant third parties access to the App and its service components, and in particular may not disclose its access data to third parties. If the user creates a user account, the user must protect his user password from access by third parties and keep it secret. The user may not pass on his password to unauthorised third parties.</li></ul><p> 4.3. In particular, the user is prohibited from (i) sublicensing, selling, reselling, transferring, assigning, distributing, sharing, leasing, renting or otherwise generating revenue from the Mondly Services, (ii) reverse engineering, disassembling, deciphering, translating, decompiling or creating derivative versions of the Mondly Software, except as required by law, (iii) enter or generate any data or other content in the App that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, invasive of another’s privacy or publicity rights, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable.</p><p> 4.4. For the term of the respective contract, the user grants Mondly the non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable right to use content entered by the user in the App, in particular to reproduce, store and process it in the App on the user’s mobile device to the extent that this is necessary for the use of the App, including its respective free basic and premium features, for the benefit of the user in accordance with these Terms of Use and the Description of Services.</p><p><strong>5. Term and termination</strong></p><p> 5.1. The use of the App, including its free basic functions, is not subject to a fixed term. Mondly or the user are entitled to terminate the App at any time with immediate effect. Mondly can terminate by deactivating a corresponding free basic function in the App or the App as a whole. The user may terminate the App including its free components by uninstalling the App from their mobile device. Mondly’s must not terminate the App including its free basic functions to the extent that the user has subscribed to premium features which require the use of the free App and&#x2F;or its free basic features as a precondition.</p><p> 5.2. For premium features, depending on the respective additional function, an initial term of 30 calendar days or 12 months applies from the day of activation of the premium feature in the app. The term of the premium feature is indicated in the App its respective description in the app and can be viewed transparently in the app on an ongoing basis. After expiry of the initial term, this is automatically extended for another same period, whereby the user is entitled to terminate the contractual relationship extended in this way at any time with a notice period of one month. Users can terminate by deselecting the respective premium feature in the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store.</p><p> 5.3. The right of either party to terminate the respective contract for good cause shall remain unaffected. Good cause shall be deemed to exist if the terminating party, taking into account the respective circumstances of the individual case and weighing the interests of both parties, can no longer reasonably be expected to continue the contractual relationship until the agreed termination or until the expiry of a notice period. If the good cause consists in the breach of an obligation under the contract, termination is only permissible after the unsuccessful expiry of a period set for remedy or after an unsuccessful warning. Section 323 (2) numbers 1 and 2 German Civil Code shall apply mutatis mutandis to the dispensability of setting a time limit for remedial action and to the dispensability of a warning. The determination of a time limit for remedial action and a warning are also dispensable if there are special circumstances which justify immediate termination after weighing the interests of both parties.</p><p> 5.4. In the event of termination, for whatever reason, all rights of use granted to the user in respect of the terminated contractual service shall come to an end. I.e. in the event of termination of a particular premium feature, the user’s rights of use to this terminated premium feature will come to an end, but the user’s rights to use other premium features or the App and its free basic functions will continue (unless these have also been terminated). If the user terminates due to a breach of a contractual obligation by Mondly and&#x2F;or for good cause and if the Customer has paid usage fees in advance, Mondly will refund the Customer the usage fees paid in advance on a proportionate basis for the period from the date on which the termination takes effect.</p><p><strong>6. Warranty</strong></p><p> 6.1. If the App, including its free basic functions and any premium features selected by the user, contains a defect at the time of provision which renders the App, a free basic function and&#x2F;or a premium feature unsuitable for use in accordance with the contract, or if such a defect arises during the term of the contract, the user will not be charged for the period during which the App was not suitable.</p><p> 6.2. In cases in which the suitability of the app, a free basic function and&#x2F;or a premium feature for use in accordance with the contract is not unavailable but merely reduced, the user shall only pay a reduced usage fee. An non-material defect or interruption shall not give rise to a reduced fee.</p><p> 6.3. Claims for damages by the user shall be subject to the limitations of liability set out in the following clause 7.</p><p><strong>7. Liability</strong></p><p> 7.1. In the event of culpable injury to life, limb or health, the existence of a guarantee, fraudulent intent or in cases of liability under the Product Liability Act, Mondly shall be liable in accordance with the statutory provisions.</p><p> 7.2. Also in accordance with the statutory provisions, Mondly is liable for damage caused by intent or gross negligence, including intent or gross negligence on the part of Mondly’s representatives or vicarious agents.</p><p> 7.3. In the event of a slightly negligent breach of a material contractual obligation, the fulfilment of which is a prerequisite for the proper implementation of the contractual agreement, the breach of which jeopardises the achievement of the contractual purpose and the observance of which the user can regularly rely on, Mondly shall be liable in accordance with the statutory provisions, but limited to compensation for the typically foreseeable damage.</p><p> 7.4. In all other respects, liability on the part of Mondly is excluded, irrespective of the legal grounds. This applies in particular to liability under Section 536a Paragraph 1 Sentence 1, 1st Alt. German Civil Code.</p><p> 7.5. The above provisions also apply in favour of Mondly’s vicarious agents.</p><p><strong>8. Property and commercial property rights</strong></p><p> Mondly is and remains the owner of all property rights and industrial property rights, in particular copyright and exploitation rights, database rights, patents, trade secrets, trademarks and all other intellectual property rights and similar rights, including technical solutions, in and relating to the App and its performance components, in particular the language content and learning methods.</p><p><strong>9. Other</strong></p><p> 9.1. The App and its service components may contain links to certain third-party products, services or software. The Customer acknowledges that any use of such third party service is governed solely by the contractual terms and privacy policies of the relevant third party provider and that Mondly does not recommend, is not liable for, and makes no representations regarding any third party service, its content or the manner in which such third party service uses, stores or processes data.</p><p> 9.2. The interpretation of this contract and all matters relating to this contract, including its formation, shall be governed exclusively by German law. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.</p><ul><li><a class="link"

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Macau’s-Trilinguism-Exposed"><a href="#Macau’s-Trilinguism-Exposed" class="headerlink" title="Macau’s Trilinguism Exposed"></a>Macau’s Trilinguism Exposed</h2><p> <strong>Macau’s language tapestry is a fascinating blend of Cantonese, Portuguese, and Macanese</strong> —a Portuguese-based creole. This intriguing linguistic composition serves as a testament to the region’s rich historical background and cultural amalgamation. Once a Portuguese colony, the city of Macau is now officially known as the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China. As a result, the Macau language, with its harmonious combination of these languages, plays a vital role in shaping this city’s unique cultural personality.</p><p> Nestled in the western Pearl River Delta by the South China Sea, Macau is a vibrant city home to approximately 680,000 inhabitants within a compact area of only 32.9 km2. So it’s no surprise that it is one of<strong>the most densely populated regions in the world.</strong> Though, the most fascinating thing about Macau remains its special blend of Eastern and Western cultures that offer a unique cultural identity that cannot be found anywhere else on the planet.</p><p> Ready to find our more about the rich linguistic mosaic of Macau? Read on to discover the intriguing history behind this captivating blend of languages.</p><h2 id="The-History-of-Macau"><a href="#The-History-of-Macau" class="headerlink" title="The History of Macau"></a>The History of Macau</h2><p> The current linguistic mosaic of Macau began taking shape almost 500 years ago. It all started in 1557, when<strong>the Ming dynasty leased Macau to Portugal</strong> as a trading post. Naturally, this marked the beginning of a significant Portuguese presence in Macau, introducing the Portuguese language and culture to the region.</p><p> The subsequent union of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Portuguese and Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> crowns from 1580 to 1640 further solidified Macau’s prominence as a major trading hub between Europe and the Far East. However, the establishment of a British trading post in nearby Hong Kong in 1750 brought about increased British influence, leading to disputes and a decline in Macau’s prominence as a trading center.</p><p> Portugal continued to administer Macau until 1999, when sovereignty was transferred back to China.</p><p> Today, Macau is a thriving gambling destination – often referred to as the “Las Vegas of the East” – with a degree of autonomy from Beijing and a gambling industry seven times larger than that of Las Vegas. The city is renowned for its high per capita incomes, ranking among the highest globally, and its impressive Human Development Index, which places it fourth worldwide in terms of life expectancy.</p><p> Furthermore, approximately two-thirds of the city’s land area consists of reclaimed land from the sea, making the territory highly urbanized.</p><p> Despite its tumultuous history, Macau is the perfect example of a happy ending.</p><h2 id="Multilingualism-in-Macau"><a href="#Multilingualism-in-Macau" class="headerlink" title="Multilingualism in Macau"></a>Multilingualism in Macau</h2><p> Now that you know the history behind it, the Macau linguistic heritage makes much more sense.</p><p><strong>The official languages of Macau are Chinese and Portuguese.</strong> Given Macau’s history as a Portuguese colony, you’d think many people in Macau speak Portuguese. However, in reality, things are different and Portuguese is spoken by only 2.3% of the people.</p><p><strong>The most widely spoken language in Macau is Cantonese,</strong> which is used in everyday life by over 85% of the population. It is the de facto Chinese dialect in Macau, with strong cultural assimilation and usage in personal interactions.</p><p> <strong>Other languages spoken in Macau include Mandarin, Macanese Portuguese, English and other Chinese variants.</strong> English is usually spoken by those who are engaged in trade, commerce and tourism, while Mandarin is taught and used for official purposes and business dealings with mainland China.</p><p> Interestingly enough, English and Mandarin speakers are more prevalent in Macau compared to Portuguese speakers. While Portuguese is the official of Macau, the British and Chinese cultures exercise a much greater influence on a global scale.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cantonese.jpg"                      alt="Cantonese in Macau" title="Exploring Macau’s Linguistic Mosaic: Cantonese, Macanese, And Portuguese Languages 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Macanese-A-Distinctive-Creole-Language-of-Macau"><a href="#Macanese-A-Distinctive-Creole-Language-of-Macau" class="headerlink" title="Macanese: A Distinctive Creole Language of Macau"></a>Macanese: A Distinctive Creole Language of Macau</h2><p><strong>Macanese Patois or the Macanese creole language, known as Patuá</strong> to its speakers, is a mixture of Cantonese, Malay, Sinhalese, and – most importantly – Portuguese. Developed as a lingua franca for communication among the multicultural community of traders, sailors, and settlers, Macanse emerged as a unique language reflecting the melting pot of cultures that Macau represented.</p><p> Known as the<strong>“sunset creole of Macau”</strong> , Macanese is mostly spoken by those of mixed heritage but is fading out among the younger generation. As a matter of fact, UNESCO’s <a class="link"   href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000187026" >Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> even classifies Patuá as a “critically endangered” language.</p><p> The development of Macau’s signature language initially occurred primarily among the descendants of Portuguese settlers in Macau. Instead of marrying locals from neighboring China, they often married women from Portuguese Malacca, Portuguese India, and Portuguese Ceylon. This led to the language adopting notable influences from Malay and Sinhala. In the 17th century, Macanese underwent a further transformation when immigrants from other Portuguese colonies in Asia arrived.</p><p> Even during the time when Macau was Portuguese territory, the usage of Macanese was already declining, and this trend is unlikely to change now that the territory is under Chinese administration. However, speakers of Macanese still hold a deep sense of pride in the fact that Macau has its unique local language.</p><h2 id="Portuguese-in-Macau-A-Journey-of-11-000-km"><a href="#Portuguese-in-Macau-A-Journey-of-11-000-km" class="headerlink" title="Portuguese in Macau: A Journey of 11,000 km"></a>Portuguese in Macau: A Journey of 11,000 km</h2><p> The story of how Portuguese came to Macau and established its presence is truly captivating. While the number of Portuguese speakers in Macau may be small today, the Portuguese influence remains evident in various aspects of Macau’s culture. This influence is particularly noticeable in the legal and administrative sectors, as well as in place names, cuisine, and other cultural elements.</p><p> Additionally, Macau boasts a vibrant Portuguese media presence, which encompasses three daily newspapers, one radio station, and a television channel.</p><p> The linguistic connection between Macau and Portugal also results in significant movement between the two regions. According to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.dsec.gov.mo/Censos2021/en-US/" >2021 Macau Census <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , individuals born in Portugal make up around 0.3% of Macau’s total population, indicating a notable presence of Portuguese-born residents in Macau.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22889392&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://webstatic.nero.com/nero2015-com-wAssets/img/affiliate/media/banner728-90eng.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Official-Portuguese-Usage-in-Macau"><a href="#Official-Portuguese-Usage-in-Macau" class="headerlink" title="Official Portuguese Usage in Macau"></a>Official Portuguese Usage in Macau</h3><p> Despite the relatively small number of Portuguese speakers in Macau, the local government remains committed to promoting the Portuguese language. In public schools, students are taught Chinese, English, and Portuguese, reflecting the importance of these languages in the education system. Additionally, the government offers free programs to facilitate the learning of Portuguese among the general population.</p><p> In official government documents, both written Portuguese and written Chinese (traditional) are used. This dual-language approach demonstrates the recognition and value given to both languages in administrative matters. In daily life, it is common to come across signs and displays in Macau that feature written Chinese and written Portuguese. This parallel use of languages is similar to the coexistence of written Chinese and British English in Hong Kong.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://vapordna.pxf.io/c/5597632/1494880/17238" target="_top" id="1494880"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17238-1494880"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1494880/17238"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Cantonese-The-Dominant-Language-of-Macau"><a href="#Cantonese-The-Dominant-Language-of-Macau" class="headerlink" title="Cantonese: The Dominant Language of Macau"></a>Cantonese: The Dominant Language of Macau</h2><p> Cantonese, a variant of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Chinese language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , is spoken in Macau, Hong Kong, Southern China, as well as by Chinese communities in North America and Southeast Asian countries.

Their survival in Macau depends on preservation efforts and demographic shifts.</p><p> In May 2012, the Public Administration and Civil Service Bureau of the Macau Special Administrative Region issued a circular emphasizing the equal importance of Chinese and Portuguese as the official languages of Macau. They urged public administrations to use both languages when releasing information to the public and requested that any existing information available in only one language be supplemented in the other language. Therefore, Portuguese in Macau seems to be safe for now as it is protected by law.</p><p> As China’s influence continues to grow, there has also been a rise in the use of Mandarin. Still, Cantonese remains dominant. On the other hand, Macanese (Patuá), with its small number of speakers, is in danger of extinction. In order to safeguard this distinctive aspect of Macau’s cultural heritage, concerted efforts are said to be made to preserve and promote Macanese through various cultural events and initiatives.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35504869&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/1_FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro Annually -  Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Is-English-widely-spoken-in-Macau"><a href="#Is-English-widely-spoken-in-Macau" class="headerlink" title="Is English widely spoken in Macau?"></a>Is English widely spoken in Macau?</h3><p> English is not as widely spoken in Macau compared to Cantonese.

To make sure you are using your newly acquired French days of the week correctly, don’t forget that:</p><ul><li><p><strong>the days of the week are not capitalized in French</strong> – unless, of course, they appear at the beginning of a sentence;</p></li><li><p><strong>the French week starts on Monday;</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>days of the week are all masculine in French</strong> – this means you’ll always have to use masculine articles <em>(le</em> and <em>un)</em>  and masculine adjectives when talking about the days of the week. For example, if you want to say “the last Friday of the month was rainy” in French, you say <em>“le dernier vendredi du mois était pluvieux”;</em></p></li><li><p>in contrast to <em>le jour</em> , <a href="https://french.kwiziq.com/revision/grammar/when-to-use-an-annee-matin-matinee-jour-journee-soir-soiree-time-unit-vs-duration"><em>la journée</em></a> (which also translates to “day”) is a feminine noun that refers to a longer period of time during which something might happen. <em>Jour,</em> on the other hand, represents a precise moment, a unit of time.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Mastering-German-A-Guide-To-16-Thank-You-Variations"><a href="#Mastering-German-A-Guide-To-16-Thank-You-Variations" class="headerlink" title="Mastering German: A Guide To 16 Thank You Variations"></a>Mastering German: A Guide To 16 Thank You Variations</h2><p> Today we are discussing <a class="link"   href="https://www.deutschland.de/en/topic/life/a-guide-to-german-etiquette" >German etiquette <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . More precisely,<strong>how do you say thank you in German</strong> depending on the social context, degree of familiarity, or the subject of discussion? We all know that just a simple<strong>“thank you” in German (Danke!)</strong> can work wonders when the context asks for it. Expressing gratitude in a foreign language is more than just a matter of being polite; it’s a sign of respect towards the culture and the country you are visiting.</p><p> Saying “thank you” to someone is one of the first things we learned when we were little – “say thank you for the chocolate to the kind gentleman!”. We all remember that <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875"                      alt="Learning German"                > – or any other language – is just slightly different from learning to speak. You start with the basics – like<strong>thank you</strong> and<strong>you’re welcome</strong> – and you continue with more advanced vocabulary like variations of the same expressions you already mastered. In English, we have multiple variations for expressing gratitude. “Thanks”, “thank you”, “thanks a bunch” or even “I’m eternally grateful to you” are just a few of them. Naturally, the German language makes no exception. Let’s discover<strong>the absolute best ways to say thank you in German.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/how-to-say-thank-you-in-german-1024x682.png"                      alt="woman receiving a flower" title="The 16 Best Ways To Say Thank You In German 2"                ></p><p> “Thank you!” by Dayne Topkin©</p><h2 id="1-Danke-—-The-universal-“Thank-you”-in-German"><a href="#1-Danke-—-The-universal-“Thank-you”-in-German" class="headerlink" title="1.Danke! — The universal “Thank you” in German"></a><strong>1.<em>Danke!</em> — The universal “Thank you” in German</strong></h2><p><em><strong>Danke</strong></em> translates to “thank you” or “thanks” and it is probably the best and certainly<strong>most common way to say thank you in German.</strong> If you already interacted with the German language, you probably heard “Danke!” before. It’s sweet, short, easy to remember, and suitable for both formal and informal contexts.</p><p> However, if you feel like more formal parlance is required, you can use the expression<strong>“Ich danke Ihnen!”.</strong></p><h2 id="2-Danke-schon-—-Thank-you-kindly"><a href="#2-Danke-schon-—-Thank-you-kindly" class="headerlink" title="2.Danke schön! — Thank you kindly!"></a><strong>2.<em>Danke schön!</em> — Thank you kindly!</strong></h2><p> Moving on and adding a little more formality to our “Danke!”, we discover_<strong>Danke schön!</strong>_ which is just as short and sweet, but maybe a little bit more formal. Although it is often used in the business environment, <strong><em>Danke schön!</em> seems suitable for all kinds of formal and informal situations.</strong> My advice would be to trust your gut.</p><h2 id="3-Danke-Sehr-–-Thank-you-very-much"><a href="#3-Danke-Sehr-–-Thank-you-very-much" class="headerlink" title="3.Danke Sehr! – Thank you very much!"></a><strong>3.<em>Danke Sehr!</em> – Thank you very much!</strong></h2><p> This is a more formal variation of_Danke schön_ , but both expressions can be used interchangeably. Like I said: trust your gut. It’s very important to take into consideration your way to talk to other people and your personality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Vielen-Dank-—-Many-thanks"><a href="#4-Vielen-Dank-—-Many-thanks" class="headerlink" title="4.Vielen Dank! — Many thanks!"></a><strong>4.<em>Vielen Dank!</em> — Many thanks!</strong></h2><p> Do you know that moment when you are really grateful to someone because they helped you a lot? Well, that’s the perfect moment to thank them in German using “Vielen Dank!”.</p><h2 id="5-Tausend-Dank-—-Thousand-thanks"><a href="#5-Tausend-Dank-—-Thousand-thanks" class="headerlink" title="5.Tausend Dank! — Thousand thanks!"></a><strong>5.<em>Tausend Dank!</em> — Thousand thanks!</strong></h2><p><em>Tausend Dank!</em> is<strong>the</strong> <strong>German equivalent of our</strong> <strong>“Thanks a million!”</strong> and it is generally used in informal situations like talking to friends or relatives.</p><h2 id="6-Danke-vielmals-–-Many-thanks"><a href="#6-Danke-vielmals-–-Many-thanks" class="headerlink" title="6.Danke vielmals! – Many thanks!"></a><strong>6.<em>Danke vielmals!</em> – Many thanks!</strong></h2><p> This is a variation of_<strong>Vielen Dank!</strong>_ and it can also translate to “thanks very much!”.

That is very kind of you.</strong></h2><p> We all have moments in our lives when we need to thank the extraordinary people that helped when we were in trouble.

Depending on whom you are talking to, use “dir” and “euch” for friends and colleagues or “Ihnen” for those who you don’t know too well.

The same, but different. But how different after all? Bernard Shaw, Irish playwright and political activist, famously said that The United States and Great Britain are<strong>“two countries divided by a common language”</strong> . Still, Brits and Americans always had this ongoing “fight” about “which English is best?” or “who speaks proper English?”. This is, of course, a joke_(or is it? hehe)_ .

Over the next 400 years, the English used in the region we now know as the United States welcomed some changes. However, these were not standardized until 1828, when Noah Webster published <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster%27s%5FDictionary" >the first American dictionary <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

For example, as already mentioned, what Americans call a “sweater” is known as “jumper” or “pullover” in the United Kingdom. In the same fashion, what is known as football across the European continent Americans call soccer.</p><p> And that’s not everything.

Although<strong>the term “soccer” was born in Britain some 200 years ago</strong> , Americans began using it to distinguish European football from American football. Then, in the ‘80, Brits began using “soccer” less and less because it had become too “American”.</p><p> Here are the most important vocabulary differences between British and American English:</p><p> Show 10 25 50 100  entries</p><p> Search:</p><table><thead><tr><th>British English</th><th>American English</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>trainers</td><td>sneakers</td></tr><tr><td>trousers</td><td>pants</td></tr><tr><td>flat</td><td>apartment</td></tr><tr><td>jumper&#x2F;pullover</td><td>sweater</td></tr><tr><td>braces</td><td>suspenders</td></tr><tr><td>bonnet</td><td>hood</td></tr><tr><td>boot</td><td>trunk</td></tr><tr><td>waistcoat</td><td>vest</td></tr><tr><td>university</td><td>college</td></tr><tr><td>holiday</td><td>vacation</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Showing 1 to 10 of 40 entries</p><p> Previous  Next</p><h2 id="Spellings-differences-is-it-“colour”-or-“color”"><a href="#Spellings-differences-is-it-“colour”-or-“color”" class="headerlink" title="Spellings differences: is it “colour” or “color”?"></a>Spellings differences: is it “colour” or “color”?</h2><p> That’s simple! “Colour” is the British spelling and “color” is the American spelling. Always remember that, when it comes to spelling, American English uses a simplified version. The explanation goes back to 1828 when Noah Webster wrote the first American dictionary –<em>An American Dictionary of the English Language.</em> Webster said he chose alternative spellings that were already in use in the United States “on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology”.</p><p> Here are the most common spelling differences between American and British English:</p><p> Show 10 25 50 100  entries</p><p> Search:</p><table><thead><tr><th>British English</th><th>American English</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>-ise</strong> (familiarise, recognise)</td><td><strong>-ize</strong> (familiarize, recognize)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>-ou</strong> (colour, humour)</td><td><strong>-o</strong> (color, humor)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>-re</strong> (metre, theatre)</td><td><strong>-re</strong> (meter, theater)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>-l-</strong> (skilful, fulfil)</td><td><strong>-ll-</strong> (skillfull, fulfill)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>-oe-&#x2F;-ae-</strong> (oestrogen, encyclopaedia)</td><td><strong>-e-</strong> (estrogen, encyclopedia)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>-ence</strong> (offence, pretence)</td><td><strong>-ense</strong> (offense, pretense)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>-ogue</strong> (analogue, catalogue)</td><td><strong>-og</strong> (analog, catalog)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>-ell-</strong> (cancelled, marvellous)</td><td><strong>-el-</strong> (canceled, marvelous)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>-y-</strong> (tyre)</td><td><strong>-i-</strong> (tire)</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Showing 1 to 9 of 9 entries</p><p> Previous  Next</p><p> If you speak English as a second language and you are not sure which is the correct spelling for the type of English you use, install a spell checker and let it do the job for you.

The usual response to this is صباح النور_(Sabah an-noor)_ which means “morning of light”. Isn’t that just beautiful?</p><p> Other morning greetings in Arabic include يسعد صباحكم_(_ <em>Yaseed sabahkom)</em> which translates to “may you have a nice morning”, صباح الياسمين_(_ <em>Sabah al Yasmine)</em> meaning “a morning full of jasmine”, and صباح أل عشت_(_ <em>Sabah al ishta)</em> which is “a morning full of cream”.</p><p> Careful though! As beautiful as they sound, these last examples can only be used with friends or people who are very close to your heart.</p><h2 id="10-Good-morning-in-Hindi-सुप्रभात"><a href="#10-Good-morning-in-Hindi-सुप्रभात" class="headerlink" title="10.

This is a common and polite way to greet someone in the morning and it is appropriate for both formal and informal settings.</p><p> If you want to ask about the person’s well-being after greeting them, you can add क्या हाल है?<em>(kya haal hai?)</em> which means “how are you?”.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Good-morning-in-Romanian-buna-dimineata"><a href="#Bonus-Good-morning-in-Romanian-buna-dimineata" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: Good morning in Romanian:bună dimineața!"></a>Bonus: Good morning in Romanian:<em>bună dimineața!</em></h2><p> Easy enough! The most straightforward way to say “good morning” in Romanian is “bună dimineața”. While the diacritics may look weird, they are quite easy to pronounce. You will pronounce “ă” like “uh” or the last sound in the word “the”. “Ț”, on the other hand, is similar to the sound you make when you say “ts”.</p><p> If you’re meeting a close friend and want to sound more like a native, you can just say “neața”.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/good-morning-in-different-languages/&t=How+to+Say+Good+Morning+in+10+Different+Languages"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="From-“good-morning”-to-conversational-fast"><a href="#From-“good-morning”-to-conversational-fast" class="headerlink" title="From “good morning” to conversational fast"></a>From “good morning” to conversational fast</h2><p> Do you want to learn languages fast?

Or any other language for that matter. Although, at some point in our lives, we feel like we were born knowing our mother tongue, the situation is far from being so. But guess what! This is actually_great_ news. This means you have real chances at learning a new language. The only question remains:<strong>what’s the best way to learn a new language?</strong> Is the best way the fastest way?</p><p> Many people struggle with this. Always trying to learn a new language but never succeeding. Until they discover that learning a new language fast is the same as losing weight: it takes ambition to make it happen. There’s no magic method, just some real tips and tricks.</p><p> So is there a shortcut to language learning after all? If you hoped you could steal Dexter’s tactic to learn French, I have news for you: it’s possible! Didn’t see that coming, did you? Yes, scientists have discovered that <a class="link"   href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/yes-you-can-learn-a-foreign-language-in-your-sleep-say-swiss-psychologists-9574112.html" >stimulus in our sleep helps consolidate memories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . But I, for one, wouldn’t risk getting stuck with just three words for the rest of my_omelette du fromage._</p><p>No, really. If you want to learn a new language, you shouldn’t rely on learning in your sleep. That’s a thing of the future. Let’s discuss what you could do_now_instead. Here are the best <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >tips on how to learn a language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> fast.</p><h2 id="The-10-best-tips-to-learn-a-language-fast"><a href="#The-10-best-tips-to-learn-a-language-fast" class="headerlink" title="The 10 best tips to learn a language fast"></a>The 10 best tips to learn a language fast</h2><p> When it comes to learning a new language, the best way to do it is by your own rules. Knowing and implementing what works for you is a highly effective method for learning a new language fast. Many polyglots will take your money and share their experience, but learning a new language is a personalized experience. What works for others doesn’t necessarily work for you.</p><p> The best way to learn a language is to find_your_ perfect mix. Once you have it, it’s also important to establish a regular study routine and use a variety of resources. Textbooks, online courses, language learning apps – you name it. Choose what works and start learning.</p><p> Let’s explore the best tips to learn a language fast that could work for you.</p><h3 id="1-Focus-on-the-basics"><a href="#1-Focus-on-the-basics" class="headerlink" title="1. Focus on the basics"></a>1. Focus on the basics</h3><p> Start by being realistic. Don’t expect to become conversational from day one. The secret is to approach your goal step by step. Start with the first<strong>100 most common words</strong> and create sentences until you feel comfortable with all of them. Then move to the next 1000. You will be surprised at how fluently you can speak after just 1000 mastered basic words.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/learn-a-new-language-960x761.png"                      alt="learn a new language" title="Tips And Techniques For Fast And Effective Language Learning 6"                ></p><p> The reason behind this “trick” is that the<strong>most common 1000 words account for 75% of all spoken communication</strong> , while the<strong>most common 3000 words account for 85% of it</strong> . If this doesn’t feel real, just ask yourself if you know and use all the words in your mother tongue. You will soon realize that the answer is “no”.</p><h3 id="2-Use-mnemonics"><a href="#2-Use-mnemonics" class="headerlink" title="2. Use mnemonics"></a>2. Use mnemonics</h3><p> I know this sounds complicated, but you may have used this learning tactic before when repetition alone wasn’t enough.</p><p> <strong>A mnemonic device is any learning technique that helps glue stubborn words or expressions to your memory.</strong> There are many types of mnemonics you can create: music, name, expression&#x2F;word, model, rhyme, note organization, image, connection or spelling mnemonics. The secret is to come up with it yourself so you’ll be more likely to remember it.</p><p> For example, when I was in college and I had to memorize a long list of words, I always tried to come up with funny sentences or songs using them. I strongly recommend trying this or other types of mnemonics to improve your learning rhythm.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698827&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/dex3REpage-newmainscreenshot.png"                      border="0"                >DEX 3 RE is Easy-To-Use DJ Mixing Software for MAC and Windows Designed for Today’s Versatile DJ. </p><p> Mix from your own library of music, iTunes or use the Pulselocker subsciprtion service for in-app access to over 44 million songs.

Identify your learning style"></a>3. Identify your learning style</h3><p> Identifying your dominant learning style can accelerate the learning process. Many people struggle to learn <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >languages because teachers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> often use the same teaching tactics for everyone, forgetting that we all have unique learning styles. How do_you_ prefer to learn? Here are the main individualized learning styles:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Learning style</th><th>You learn…</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>visual</strong> (spatial)</td><td>using pictures, images, and spatial understanding</td></tr><tr><td><strong>aural</strong> (auditory-musical)</td><td>using sound and music</td></tr><tr><td><strong>verbal</strong> (linguistic)</td><td>using words, both in speech and writing</td></tr><tr><td><strong>physical</strong> (kinesthetic)</td><td>using your body, hands and sense of touch</td></tr><tr><td><strong>logical</strong> (mathematical)</td><td>using logic, reasoning and systems</td></tr><tr><td><strong>social</strong> (interpersonal)</td><td>better in groups or with other people</td></tr><tr><td><strong>solitary</strong> (intrapersonal)</td><td>you prefer to work alone and use self-study.</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Use this information in your own best interest and<strong>learning a new language</strong> can happen a lot faster than you think.</p><h3 id="4-Train-your-ears-and-muscles-for-the-new-language"><a href="#4-Train-your-ears-and-muscles-for-the-new-language" class="headerlink" title="4. Train your ears and muscles for the new language"></a>4. Train your ears and muscles for the new language</h3><p> When one of my friends moved to Denmark to study computer science, her biggest problem was learning Danish. Classes didn’t help much. Four months later and she still didn’t have a clue about the Danish language and its mysterious ways. So, she started learning by herself using language learning apps – like <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-1322&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-1322&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-1322" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – and other learning strategies that I have shared with her.</p><p> The first step was to train her speech muscles in order to master pronunciation. You won’t believe it, but that was exactly like going to the gym. My friend’s mother tongue is Romanian. Naturally, the Danish language uses different speech muscles that begin to hurt when you first start practicing. In other words, we call this muscle soreness, but who would have thought that you could get it from<strong>speaking another language</strong> ? It’s funny but also true for my friend!</p><p> Therefore, it’s always necessary to train your speech muscles and ears. Any foreign language may sound weird in the beginning. The secret is to hold on to it and exercise with common sounds until it becomes familiar.</p><h3 id="5-Study-pronunciation-rules-and-practice"><a href="#5-Study-pronunciation-rules-and-practice" class="headerlink" title="5. Study pronunciation rules and practice"></a>5. Study pronunciation rules and practice</h3><p> Everyone knows grammar can be overwhelming in any language. When learning a new language, we become so obsessed with grammar that we forget to study what matters most: pronunciation rules.</p><p> Every language has its own pronunciation rules.

This means that you can practice by expressing your inner thoughts in the language you want to learn.</p><p> People often claim that speaking in another language changes your personality. The process resembles the idea of having an alter ego. If this works the same for you, let your foreign language alter ego speak.

Today, my brain associates Danish lessons with something that I enjoy doing and information retention is much easier. Our brain opens just like a flower when we like what we are learning.</p><p> Just as effective,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >music will give a new perspective on the language you’re learning <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Read only what matters"></a>8. Read only what matters</h3><p> Probably the best way to learn a language is through reading. Once you have mastered the basics of the language you’re learning, reading can take you to the next level. Even though you don’t know all the foreign words, context can help you extract their meaning.</p><p> For example, if you’re <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learning Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , start the process by reading your favorite book in Spanish. Having already read it in your native language will make it easier to subtract meaning and discover new words.</p><p> And it doesn’t necessarily have to be books. You can also read articles, poetry or whatever interests you more. Are you a Harry Potter fan? Great, read that. Considering its reading level (middle grade), Harry Potter is a good choice. Sure, it contains a lot of made-up terms as it’s a book about wizards, but that shouldn’t stop you from learning new and useful words. It’s not all magic and spells, after all.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2067133&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/gcb/banScrn.jpg"                      border="0"                >Greeting Card Builder</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="9-Try-comprehensible-input"><a href="#9-Try-comprehensible-input" class="headerlink" title="9. Try comprehensible input"></a>9. Try comprehensible input</h3><p> Comprehensible input is highly connected to what we mentioned earlier about consuming content in the language you want to learn. Basically, comprehensible input refers to language material that is at or slightly above your current proficiency level, allowing you to understand and learn from it.</p><p> This method involves consuming content such as reading material, podcasts, videos, and conversations in your target language that you can comprehend with some effort but which still challenges you to learn new vocabulary and grammar concepts. This approach helps you learn a language quickly and more naturally, similar to how you learned your first language. Just remember to choose materials that interest you and keep you engaged, so you can learn at your own pace and make progress.</p><h3 id="10-Immerse-yourself-in-the-language"><a href="#10-Immerse-yourself-in-the-language" class="headerlink" title="10. Immerse yourself in the language"></a>10. Immerse yourself in the language</h3><p> Immersion is praised as one of the best ways to learn a language. Once you become able to speak your new language fluently or even at a satisfactory level, it’s time to go out into the world. Your objective is to communicate with real people as much as possible.</p><p> Unfortunately, immersion isn’t always cheap. You’ll need both time and money to travel to another country and spend enough time there to experience immersion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/learning-a-new-language-960x620.jpg"                      alt="&#39;Learning a new language&#39; by Sam Lion©" title="Tips And Techniques For Fast And Effective Language Learning 9"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/336__280a.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> So what’s to be done? The cheapest way is to create an immersion environment at home. Basically, apply all the above-mentioned tips at once. Surround yourself with books in the language you want to learn, listen to music, learn the lyrics and sing along, read books and articles in your target language – everything all at once.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Languages-of-Unity-and-Diversity-in-Belgium"><a href="#Languages-of-Unity-and-Diversity-in-Belgium" class="headerlink" title="Languages of Unity and Diversity in Belgium"></a>Languages of Unity and Diversity in Belgium</h2><p> Ok, let’s make it clear right from the start: there’s nfluento ‘Belgian’ language. Neither is there_a_ “Belgium language”. Why? Because<strong>Belgium has not one, but three official languages:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Dutch (Flemish);</strong></li><li><strong>French;</strong></li><li><strong>German.</strong></li></ol><p> Most people already know that Dutch and French are spoken in Belgium, but German is not as popular. While Dutch and French are spoken by almost 100% of Belgians,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >German only counts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for roughly 1% of the entire population. However, in addition to these three official languages, some Belgians also speak Luxembourgish, Limburgish, Walloon and many others. The language locals speak depends a lot on the region you’re in. Let’s take a closer look at the distribution of languages in Belgium.</p><h2 id="Which-languages-are-spoken-in-Belgium"><a href="#Which-languages-are-spoken-in-Belgium" class="headerlink" title="Which languages are spoken in Belgium?"></a>Which languages are spoken in Belgium?</h2><p> Belgium, officially “the Kingdom of Belgium”, is a country in Northwestern Europe bordered by <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >the Netherlands <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Germany, Luxembourg, France, and the North Sea. Now one thing we know for sure: Belgium certainly has many neighbors and most of them influenced which languages are spoken here.</p><p> Article 4 of the <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution%5Fof%5FBelgium" >Belgian constitution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> divides the country into three communities&#x2F;regions that are based on four language areas. These linguistic areas are: the French-speaking area, the Dutch-speaking area, the bilingual (French and Dutch) area of Brussels Capital, and the German-speaking area.</p><h3 id="1-Dutch-Flemish"><a href="#1-Dutch-Flemish" class="headerlink" title="1. Dutch (Flemish)"></a>1. Dutch (Flemish)</h3><p> The Dutch-speaking region of Belgium, known as Flanders, is located in the northern part of the country. Flanders includes the cities of Antwerp, Bruges, and Ghent.</p><p> Though the standard form of Dutch used here is almost identical to that spoken in the Netherlands, it is often called “Belgian-Dutch” or, colloquially, “Flemish”.<strong>About 60% of the population of Belgium speaks Flemish.</strong> That’s roughly 6.5 million people.</p><p> If you already know how to speak Dutch, then you’ll have no problem communicating with people in Belgium. If not, don’t worry! There’s always French or even German.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851655&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-French"><a href="#2-French" class="headerlink" title="2.

This area includes the cities of Brussels, Liege, and Namur.</p><p><strong>Spoken by about 40% of the population,</strong> Belgian-French is not very different from the “standard French” in France. Thus, if you want to mash two potatoes with one fork, learning French can come in handy in both neighboring countries.</p><p> Even if you don’t <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >speak French <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> fluently, being able to say a few phrases will go a long way in making locals feel more comfortable around you. Plus, it shows that you’re interested in their culture and willing to make a little effort to truly connect with them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657397/16446" target="_top" id="1657397"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657397"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657397/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-German"><a href="#3-German" class="headerlink" title="3.

This region is known as <strong>the German-speaking community of Belgium and includes about 73,000 people.</strong> That’s roughly 1% of the entire population of Belgium.</p><p> Considering this territory only joined Belgium after World War I, the German spoken here is not very different from “standard German”. Therefore, if you already <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >speak German <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you should have no problem communicating with the locals.</p><p><strong>Learn the languages of Belgium with Mondly</strong> 👇</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-7110&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-7110&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-7110" >Learn with Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701"                      border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Luxembourgish-Limburgish-and-other-minority-languages"><a href="#4-Luxembourgish-Limburgish-and-other-minority-languages" class="headerlink" title="4.

Luxembourgish, Limburgish and other minority languages</h3><p> If you thought Flemish, French and German were the only languages spoken in Belgium, you’re in for a treat. In the Belgian province of Luxembourg, which – unsurprisingly – borders the country of Luxembourg, you can also hear<strong>a fourth language: Luxembourgish.</strong></p><p> Spoken in the Arelerland district, Luxembourgish is not recognized at a national level, but the French Community of Belgium acknowledges it as a minority language.</p><p> In addition to this, Belgium is also home to several other Germanic and Romance dialects or varieties:</p><ul><li><strong>Germanic dialects or varieties:</strong> Brabantian and East Flemish (both regarded as varieties of Dutch rather than separate Flemish languages), Limburgish, West Flemish, Low Dietsch;</li><li><strong>Romance dialects or varieties:</strong> Walloon, Picard, Champenois, and Lorrain (these are all varieties related to French that have been recognized by the French Community as separate languages).</li></ul><p> As you can see, the Kingdom of Belgium is a melting pot of different languages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/belgium-languages-960x600.jpg"                      alt="&quot;Belgium languages&quot; by Elijah G©" title="What Languages Do They Speak In Belgium? 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BScreen%2BRecorder%2Bbox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/f026b149-fc7c-fd54-5f3e-1460bbb19b6b.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Can-you-get-by-with-English-in-Belgium"><a href="#Can-you-get-by-with-English-in-Belgium" class="headerlink" title="Can you get by with English in Belgium?"></a>Can you get by with English in Belgium?</h2><p> Yes and no. It all depends on which region you are visiting. <strong>People working in hospitality and other such “social” jobs will normally speak English – especially in the more touristy areas.</strong></p><p> However, it seems that, similar to Parisians, locals in Belgium are reluctant to talk to tourists in English. Especially if the visitors don’t attempt to talk in French, Dutch or German before resorting to English.</p><p> It’s true that all locals appreciate the extra effort you put into learning a few words in their native language. But Belgians tend to appreciate this gesture more than most. So, if you want to make friends, learning the basics of at least Dutch and French before your trip to Belgium can go a long way.</p><p> One last thing: be careful not to mix things up. If you’re in Wallonia, go with French, but if you’re in Flanders, go with Dutch. It is not uncommon for <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >French-speaking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Belgians to have a limited understanding of Flemish, so speaking Flemish in a French-speaking region may not help.</p><p> Besides, you may be met with silence if you do so. Both the Walloons and the Flemish are protective of their respective mother tongues and may not appreciate being spoken to in a language other than their own.</p><h2 id="A-brief-history-of-Belgium"><a href="#A-brief-history-of-Belgium" class="headerlink" title="A brief history of Belgium"></a>A brief history of Belgium</h2><p> The linguistic diversity of Belgium can be traced back to political and cultural conflicts that started centuries ago and continue to influence the country even today. The region that is now Belgium has been inhabited by various groups of people over the centuries, including the Celts, the Romans, the Franks, and the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Vikings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Besides, having important port cities like Antwerp, Bruges and Ghent made the region open to tradesmen, merchants, bankers and artists from all over the world. Naturally, these different groups brought their own languages and cultural traditions to the area.</p><p> To put it very briefly, in the Middle Ages, Belgium was a part of the Holy Roman Empire and was heavily influenced by its culture. However, after the fall of the empire, the region came under the control of the Burgundians, who spoke Old Dutch (the ancestor of the Dutch language). When the Burgundian Empire was divided, the southern part of Belgium became a part of the Habsburg Empire, which was dominated by the Spanish and the Austrians. Then, as a result of the French Revolutionary Wars campaigns in 1794, the Low Countries (which included today’s Belgium) were annexed by the French First Republic, bringing an end to Austrian rule in the region. As a result, the region came under the influence of the French language.</p><p> Over time, the linguistic divide between the northern and southern parts of Belgium became more pronounced – with the north-speaking Dutch (known as Flemish) and the south-speaking French.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Timeless-Lines-Everyday-Words-From-the-Bard’s-Vocabulary"><a href="#Timeless-Lines-Everyday-Words-From-the-Bard’s-Vocabulary" class="headerlink" title="Timeless Lines: Everyday Words From the Bard’s Vocabulary"></a>Timeless Lines: Everyday Words From the Bard’s Vocabulary</h2><p> We, as speakers of the English language, owe a great debt to William Shakespeare. He wasn’t just one of the greatest playwrights of all time, but also a prolific inventor of words. Many of the<strong>words Shakespeare invented</strong> or coined are still in common use today. The masterful storyteller had so much to express that he needed to push the boundaries of the English vocabulary as he knew it.<strong>Some of the most surprisingly common words Shakespeare invented are:</strong></p><ul><li>bedroom</li><li>embrace</li><li>employer</li><li>excitement</li><li>fashionable</li><li>generous</li><li>informal</li><li>invitation</li><li>lonely</li><li>manager</li><li>satisfying</li><li>useful</li></ul><p> And these are just a few of the words Shakespeare introduced to the world during his life in the Elizabethan England. Whether you’re a fan of Shakespeare or simply enjoy learning about the evolution of the English language, this article is sure to captivate and entertain you. So stick around and read on to discover some more of the words Shakespeare invented.</p><h2 id="How-many-words-did-Shakespeare-invent"><a href="#How-many-words-did-Shakespeare-invent" class="headerlink" title="How many words did Shakespeare invent?"></a>How many words did Shakespeare invent?</h2><p><strong>Most sources agree that Shakespeare invented around 1700 words.</strong> However, it seems there’s more to this story. While the playwright was indeed very productive in this field, some say that not all these words were created by him. Instead, he was just the first one to document these words in writing. And that’s entirely possible.</p><p> Let’s look at this way. <strong>There is a good likelihood that some of the words attributed to Shakespeare were used in Elizabethan England on a daily basis. Only not in writing.</strong> And what did Shakespeare do? He naturally introduced them in his work after having heard them in conversations with peers or other people. In these instances, Shakespeare is recorded as the first individual to have written documentation of these words.</p><p> As a matter of fact, occasional <a class="link"   href="https://blogs.loc.gov/folklife/2020/04/proverbs-myths-and-the-bard-are-we-really-quoting-shakespeare/" >new research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> reveals that Shakespeare was actually not the originator of some of these terms. The Oxford English Dictionary holds a vast amount of words for which it lists Shakespeare as the first recorded usage, leading to the widespread assertion that Shakespeare was a prodigious coiner of words. But as it turns out, most of the OED editors at that time chose Shakespeare as a source simply because he was the earliest author they looked at.</p><p> According to the <a class="link"   href="https://public.oed.com/history/oed-editions/" >OED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the most frequently quoted single author in the Second Edition of the Dictionary (published in 1989) is William Shakespeare with approximately 33,300 quotations.</p><p> Be that as it may, we’re not suggesting Shakespeare was not a genius of words. We’re simply stating we should take numbers with a grain of salt.</p><h3 id="How-did-Shakespeare-invent-words"><a href="#How-did-Shakespeare-invent-words" class="headerlink" title="How did Shakespeare invent words?"></a>How did Shakespeare invent words?</h3><p> The master storyteller famously invented new words pretty much the same way we do today: through prefixes, suffixes, conversion and compounds. Simply put, Shakespeare’s words were created by:</p><ul><li>turning nouns into verbs;</li><li>using verbs as adjectives;</li><li>connecting words that have never before been used together before;</li><li>adding prefixes or suffixes;</li><li>concocting entirely original terms.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shakespeare-words.jpg"                      alt="Shakespeare words" title="Shakespeare’s Words: 36 Words Shakespeare Invented That We Still Use Today 2"                ></p><h2 id="Cool-words-Shakespeare-invented"><a href="#Cool-words-Shakespeare-invented" class="headerlink" title="Cool words Shakespeare invented"></a>Cool words Shakespeare invented</h2><p><em>To invent new words, or not to invent new words?</em> Clearly, William Shakespeare did not ask himself that. He just went with it and invented new words so he could properly tell his stories. In the end, he was so good at both storytelling and coining words that today it is impossible to have an English curriculum without Shakespeare. But enough tittle-tattle.<strong>Let’s see what other words Shakespeare invented:</strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997817/17059" target="_top" id="1997817"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-1997817"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997817/17059"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Addiction"><a href="#1-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="1.

Before delivering your pick up line in French, take a moment to assess the situation. Is it the right moment for an icebreaker? What do you know about this person? If you notice something relevant that catches your eye, don’t hesitate to tailor one of the previously mentioned pick-up lines to make it more personal.</p><p> For instance, if you spotted a Formula 1-themed keychain or caught a bit of their conversation about a favorite action movie, use that information to your advantage.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254762&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/11_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png"                      border="0"                > PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Pick-Up-Lines-for-Girls-in-France"><a href="#Best-Pick-Up-Lines-for-Girls-in-France" class="headerlink" title="Best Pick Up Lines for Girls in France"></a>Best Pick Up Lines for Girls in France</h2><ul><li><em>Tu dois être un chef-d’œuvre, parce que chaque fois que je te vois, je me sens au Louvre.</em>  (“You must be a masterpiece, because every time I see you, I feel like I’m in the Louvre.”)</li><li><em>Es-tu un artiste ?

Delivering your French pick-up line too zealously may backfire. Instead of breaking the ice, it might make you come across as overbearing. That’s the last thing we want! Ensure you smile and clearly convey that your French pick-up line is meant as a lighthearted joke and an icebreaker.</p><p> In conclusion, pick up lines in French offer a unique charm and effectiveness in flirting, especially when you’re drawn to someone who appreciates the language of love. The key to success lies in their playful delivery and the personal touch you bring. Remember, the true art of using these lines is to spark joy and intrigue, creating memorable moments that resonate with the spirit of French allure. With a balanced approach and a light-hearted attitude, you’re set to make an impression that’s as captivating as the French language itself.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/french-pick-up-lines/&t=Whispering+Sweet+Nothings+in+French:+Irresistible+Pick-Up+Lines"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.zonealarm.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=36245101&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sc1.checkpoint.com/sc1/za/images/boxes/zang_box_trust.png"                      border="0"                >ZoneAlarm Extreme Security NextGen</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Learn-French-for-the-one-you-love"><a href="#Learn-French-for-the-one-you-love" class="headerlink" title="Learn French for the one you love"></a>Learn French for the one you love</h3><p> Did you use one of these pick up lines in French and successfully broke the ice?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Initiating-Your-Adventure-with-Hanzi"><a href="#Initiating-Your-Adventure-with-Hanzi" class="headerlink" title="Initiating Your Adventure with Hanzi"></a>Initiating Your Adventure with Hanzi</h2><p> Chinese is a very fascinating language, not only because it is one of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >hardest languages <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to learn but also because it is one of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >oldest languages <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the world. Mastering Chinese, even at a basic level, should be considered a personal triumph, considering the high number of Chinese characters you need to know to simply read a newspaper. However, unlike what we are used to when it comes to learning a new language, these characters are not organized into an alphabet because there is no Chinese alphabet_per se_ .</p><p> Although most languages use alphabets, Chinese doesn’t. Chinese is all about Chinese characters – thousands of them. If you are familiar with the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Japanese writing system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you will know that each character represents a syllable or even an entire word, but we’ll get to that later.</p><p> Now, written Chinese may be a bit overwhelming in the beginning, but if you are really passionate and dedicated, uncovering the beauty of the Chinese alphabet and its characters will give you a great sense of accomplishment.</p><p> Here’s a quick example of how ingenious Chinese characters can be. While <strong>电_diàn_</strong>  translates to<strong>“electric”</strong> ,<strong>“brain”</strong> is <strong>脑_nǎo_</strong>  and if you put these two characters together, you get<strong>电脑</strong> <em><strong>diànnǎo</strong></em> which means<strong>“computer”</strong> . Electric brain &#x3D; computer! See what they did there? Absolutely fascinating! Let’s find out what exactly you should expect if you want to learn Chinese.</p><h2 id="The-Chinese-language-in-a-nutshell"><a href="#The-Chinese-language-in-a-nutshell" class="headerlink" title="The Chinese language in a nutshell"></a>The Chinese language in a nutshell</h2><p> As you probably already know,<a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese%5Flanguage" >Chinese <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (汉语 or_Hànyǔ_) is not necessarily a single language – Mandarin, but more of a macrolanguage or a family of East Asian languages spoken by 1.3 billion people all around the world. Can you imagine? <strong>Roughly 17% of the world’s population speak some variety of Chinese as their native language.</strong></p><h3 id="Varieties-of-Chinese"><a href="#Varieties-of-Chinese" class="headerlink" title="Varieties of Chinese"></a>Varieties of Chinese</h3><p> Before getting into a little history, you should know that the varieties of Chinese are united by a common written language or a common writing system. While some people consider these varieties of Chinese dialects, others regard them as distinct languages because more often than not they are unintelligible.</p><p> Standard Chinese, generally referred to as Mandarin, is the official language of the People’s Republic of China, The Republic of China (also known as Taiwan) and one of the four official languages of Singapore.</p><p> So how many varieties of Chinese are there? That depends on how you choose to count and categorize them, but many sources seem to agree that there are over<strong>200 distinct varieties of Chinese in 13 dialect groups.</strong></p><p> Out of these 13 groups of dialects, there are 7 that are considered major: Mandarin, Yue (Cantonese), Xiang, Min, Gan, Wu and Hakka.</p><h3 id="The-history-of-the-Chinese-language-and-its-alphabet"><a href="#The-history-of-the-Chinese-language-and-its-alphabet" class="headerlink" title="The history of the Chinese language and its alphabet"></a>The history of the Chinese language and its alphabet</h3><p> Chinese is not what we’d call a new language. Chinese is a language with a long tradition that has touched the lips of many great emperors from many great dynasties before becoming the language we all know (or wished we’d known) today. If we also count in <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old%5FChinese" >Old Chinese <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is the oldest attested stage of Chinese and the ancestor of all modern varieties of Chinese, we could say that Chinese is around 3200 years old. No less than three millennia of tradition!</p><p> The form of written Chinese that developed from Old Chinese between 220 CE and the end of the Han dynasty, in the 3rd century CE, is known as Classical Chinese or literary Chinese. This formal written language continued to be used until the beginning of the 20th century. At the same time, written vernacular Chinese also developed alongside it.</p><p> Meanwhile, spoken Chinese continued to evolve into Middle Chinese, the ancestor of almost all modern Chinese varieties. However, Middle Chinese was most a single unified language, but a family of mutually intelligible dialects that began diverging into different directions around the 10th century CE.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/chinese-characters-600x402.jpg"                      alt="chinese characters" title="Quick Introduction To The Chinese Alphabet, Chinese Characters And Pinyin 2"                ></p><p> Chinese antique calligraphic text</p><p> Then, in the early 20th century, written vernacular Chinese based on the Beijing dialect was introduced as the new official written language instead of Classical Chinese. People often refer to this standard language as Mandarin because it is based on the Mandarin dialect of Beijing. Thus, Standard Chinese or Mandarin now fulfills the role that Classical Chinese used to fulfill as the official written language that’s used by speakers of all varieties of Chinese.</p><h2 id="The-Chinese-writing-system-and-the-Chinese-alphabet-–-an-overview"><a href="#The-Chinese-writing-system-and-the-Chinese-alphabet-–-an-overview" class="headerlink" title="The Chinese writing system and the Chinese alphabet – an overview"></a>The Chinese writing system and the Chinese alphabet – an overview</h2><p> The Chinese language is written using <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese%5Fcharacters" >Chinese characters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or 漢字_(hànzì) _ . As already mentioned, there is no such thing as a Chinese alphabet, so we’ll continue by talking about the Chinse characters. These are logograms or single characters that represent entire syllables, entire words or entire units of meaning. For example, <strong>漢_(hàn) _</strong>  means<strong>“China”</strong> and <strong>字_(zì) _</strong>  means<strong>“character”</strong> . Together they translate to<strong>“Chinese character” (</strong> <em><strong>hànzì)</strong> .</em></p><p> Chinese characters need to be learned one by one because, unfortunately for us, western speakers, knowing the pronunciation of a word doesn’t give you any clue on how to write it.</p><p> Don’t worry though. There is also good news for us, Chinese beginners! Speakers of all varieties of Chinese typically write in <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard%5FChinese" >Standard Chinese <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> even though their spoken language is different. Of course, they’ll pronounce each character in their local variety of Chinese but use the Standard Chinese characters. Nevertheless, you should also note that Chinese languages are often different in terms of grammar and vocabulary. So whatever variety of Chinese you choose to learn, it’s best to stick to it until the end so you won’t get confused.</p><h3 id="Two-different-systems-for-writing-Chinese-characters"><a href="#Two-different-systems-for-writing-Chinese-characters" class="headerlink" title="Two different systems for writing Chinese characters"></a>Two different systems for writing Chinese characters</h3><p> And when you thought it gets easier… it gets complicated again. Luckily, you were born in the right century and there are smart language learning apps such as <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5327&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5327?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=zh&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5327?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=zh" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that can help you learn Chinese easier.</p><p> So yes, there are two different systems for writing Chinese characters. There are the<strong>traditional characters</strong> from Classical Chinese, and the<strong>simplified characters</strong> , which were created in the 1950s and 1960s to increase literacy.</p><p> Simplified characters are used in the People’s Republic of China and Singapore and traditional characters are used in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau because they were not under Chinese rule when the simplified characters were introduced.</p><p> Despite the obvious differences between the two systems, literate native speakers generally have no problem reading either of them.</p><h3 id="Don’t-forget-about-pronunciation"><a href="#Don’t-forget-about-pronunciation" class="headerlink" title="Don’t forget about pronunciation"></a>Don’t forget about pronunciation</h3><p> All Chinese varieties or languages – however you want to refer to them – are tonal languages. In other terms, the meaning of a word depends on the tone or the tones that you say it with. Unfortunately for us, those not used to tonal languages, if you change the tone, the meaning of the word can change entirely. That’s why it is always important to give some context.</p><p> Let’s take the example of Mandarin, the most widely spoken Chinese dialect. Mandarin has four tones plus one neutral tone: a high flat tone, a rising tone, a falling-rising tone, a falling tone and, of course, a neutral tone (where the syllable is not distinguished by tone at all). Here’s a very eloquent case: <strong>狮_(shī),_ 十_(shí)_</strong>  and   <strong>是_(shì)_</strong>  all sound almost the same for us, westerners, but they actually mean completely different things:<strong>“lion”, “ten”</strong> and<strong>“to be”</strong> . The only difference is the tone:<strong>a neutral tone, a rising tone</strong> and<strong>a falling tone.</strong></p><p> Do we see why it is so crucial for you to pay attention to tones and pronunciation from your very first <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Chinese lesson <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=30901369&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/1_copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix 4K - Software based live production. vMix 4K includes everything in vMix HD plus 4K support, PTZ control, External&#x2F;Fullscreen output, 4 Virtual Outputs, 1 Replay, 4 vMix Call, and 2 Recorders.<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-many-Chinese-Characters-does-the-Chinese-alphabet-have"><a href="#How-many-Chinese-Characters-does-the-Chinese-alphabet-have" class="headerlink" title="How many Chinese Characters does the Chinese alphabet have?"></a>How many Chinese Characters does the Chinese alphabet have?</h2><p> Many people ask this question because they want an overview of how much will they have to study or simply out of curiosity. However, since there is no Chinese alphabet, there is no definite answer. But there are some statistics that will probably give you an idea.</p><p><strong>A modern Chinese dictionary has around 20,000 characters.</strong> So how many Chinese characters should you learn to be comfortable with day-to-day Chinese? Some say more, some say less, but around<strong>2,000 characters are enough for you so socialize</strong> taking into consideration the fact that you need to know 2,633 Chinese characters and 5,000 <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Chinese words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to pass the HSK6 exam.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/written-chinese-600x450.jpg"                      alt="written Chinese" title="Quick Introduction To The Chinese Alphabet, Chinese Characters And Pinyin 3"                ></p><p> “Written Chinese” by Cherry Lin</p><p> But how many Chinese characters really are there? Well, this is a whole other story. The Great Compendium of Chinese Characters or the_Hànyǔ dà zìdiǎn_ (汉语大字典) has<strong>54,678 characters</strong> . Absolutely incredible number. But wait because The Dictionary of Chinese Variant Form or the_Zhōnghuá zì hǎi_ (中华字海) has no less than…<strong>106,230 characters!</strong></p><p> Don’t let those numbers scare you though. If you really want to do this and you are passionate enough, learning Chinese won’t be about numbers, but about how accomplished you’ll feel when you’ll learn something new.</p><h2 id="What-is-Pinyin"><a href="#What-is-Pinyin" class="headerlink" title="What is Pinyin?"></a>What is Pinyin?</h2><p> Pinyin or <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin" >Hanyu Pinyin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (汉语拼音) is for Chinese what <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >rōmaji is for Japanese <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Meaning –<strong>the official romanization system for Standard Chinese.</strong> In other words, Pinyin uses the Latin alphabet to tell you exactly how to pronounce Chinese characters. It even includes diacritics to indicate tones, so if you don’t necessarily need to learn written Chinese and its many characters, Pinyin is a great way to get going.</p><p> All you’ll need to do when working with Pinyin is get English out of your mind. As tempted as you’ll be to pronounce the sounds you already know in a way you are familiar with, don’t forget you are learning Chinese. And Chinese has little to nothing in common to English when it comes to pronunciation.</p><h2 id="How-do-you-learn-the-Chinese-alphabet"><a href="#How-do-you-learn-the-Chinese-alphabet" class="headerlink" title="How do you learn the Chinese alphabet?"></a>How do you learn the Chinese alphabet?</h2><p> If you do not wish to settle to Pinyin, how do you learn the Chinese alphabet or, better said, the Chinese characters? After all, we can all agree that there is a huge amount of information you need to remember. How do people learn Chinese?</p><p> Well, first of all, the Chinese language in its entirety is fairly logical because it makes lots and lots of intelligent connections like the one you learned at the beginning of this article with “electric”_(_ 电_diàn)_ + “brain”_(_ 脑_nǎo)_ = “computer”_(_ 电脑_diànnǎo)_ . This will definitely help you expand your vocabulary fairly fast.</p><p> Then there are<strong>Chinese radicals.</strong> A Chinese radical (部首 bùshǒu) is a graphical component of a Chinese character under which the character is traditionally listed in the dictionary. In not so complicated words, a Chinese radical is <strong>a section of a character that can appear in multiple other Chinese characters as a way of showing they are connected.</strong></p><p> For example, if we look at “liquid”_(_ 液_– yè)_ , “river”_(_ 河_– hé)_ and “foam” or “bubble”_(_ 泡_– pào)_ , you’ll see that all three characters begin with the same three strokes. That’s not random at all! That is the radical which shows that all three words are connected to “water” (which is the radical in this situation). Pretty interesting, huh?</p><p> Learning Chinese is definitely unlike learning other languages. It’s a unique process. Some may even call it art. And maybe it really is. You decide what you want it to be for you. Depending on your learning style, you’ll find the tips and tricks that will best suit you.

In line with this commitment, we are taking a major step forward by aligning our educational philosophy with the <a class="link"   href="https://www.pearson.com/languages/why-pearson/the-global-scale-of-english/the-global-scale-of-languages.html" >Global Scale of Languages (GSL) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> principles.</p><p> This alignment marks a pivotal advancement in offering a structured framework that will greatly benefit not only English learners but also those studying other languages. We will first focus on the Spanish, French, and Italian courses, with more languages to follow.</p><p> The Global Scale of Languages (GSL) helps educators and language learners know where they are, where they need to go and how they can get there.</p><h2 id="Starting-with-the-Global-Scale-of-English-GSE"><a href="#Starting-with-the-Global-Scale-of-English-GSE" class="headerlink" title="Starting with the Global Scale of English (GSE)"></a><strong>Starting with the Global Scale of English (GSE)</strong></h2><p> Before we delve deeper into the GSL, it’s crucial to understand its roots: the GSE.</p><p> The Global Scale of English (GSE) is not just another language framework; it’s an evolution in understanding linguistic proficiency.</p><p> Unlike other frameworks that describe language proficiency in broad bands, the GSE offers a finely-grained scale. It identifies what a learner can accomplish at each point across speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills. This unique approach motivates learners by offering a more detailed view of their progression.</p><h2 id="Introducing-the-Global-Scale-of-Languages-GSL"><a href="#Introducing-the-Global-Scale-of-Languages-GSL" class="headerlink" title="Introducing the Global Scale of Languages (GSL)"></a><strong>Introducing the Global Scale of Languages (GSL)</strong></h2><p>Building on this solid foundation, <strong>Pearson has now introduced the Global Scale of Languages (GSL).</strong></p><p> The GSL is an extension and expansion of the principles laid down by the GSE. While the GSE enjoys international recognition and remains crucial to numerous Pearson offerings, the GSL builds upon its legacy by incorporating a broader range of languages.</p><p> By placing languages on a common scale, underpinned by a common set of Learning Objectives, the GSL can ensure comparability across languages to bring greater clarity and simplicity to language learning.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4596923&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_468X60.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-Pearson-created-the-GSL"><a href="#How-Pearson-created-the-GSL" class="headerlink" title="How Pearson created the GSL"></a><strong>How Pearson created the GSL</strong></h3><p> Building on the GSE, our research team at Pearson decided to prove that this scale could also be transferable to other languages. The study’s results were not only encouraging but groundbreaking. The research confirmed that the GSE is directly transferable to other languages, making it possible for Pearson to develop the new GSL framework.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2086436/19576" target="_top" id="2086436"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2086436"                      border="0" alt="" width="1500" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2086436/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Why-the-GSL-stands-out"><a href="#Why-the-GSL-stands-out" class="headerlink" title="Why the GSL stands out"></a><strong>Why the GSL stands out</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Unparalleled insights:</strong>  Going a step beyond traditional language measurement tools like the CEFR, the GSL provides a more detailed understanding of a learner’s skills through extensive global research.</li><li><strong>Confidence in clarity:</strong>  The GSL enables learners to pinpoint their strengths in reading, writing, listening, and speaking with a straightforward 10-90 scale. This level of clarity fosters motivation and boosts learners’ confidence.</li><li><strong>Personalized learning pathways:</strong>  With clear objectives at each scale point, the GSL ensures a learning journey tailored to individual goals, making progression more efficient.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-start-with-French-Spanish-and-Italian"><a href="#Why-start-with-French-Spanish-and-Italian" class="headerlink" title="Why start with French, Spanish, and Italian?"></a><strong>Why start with French, Spanish, and Italian?</strong></h2><p> These three languages, rich in history and culture, have always been popular choices among our learners. We believe that by integrating GSL with these languages first, we can enhance the learning experience for a larger number of our users.</p><p> Moreover, the Romance languages, with their shared Latin roots and interconnected nuances, offer a fascinating study when approached with the precision of the GSL.</p><p> As a Mondly user immersing in these languages, you can expect a fresh content approach, and a progressively structured layout.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1300375&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-15_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Language-learning-backed-by-unparalleled-global-research"><a href="#Language-learning-backed-by-unparalleled-global-research" class="headerlink" title="Language learning backed by unparalleled global research"></a><strong>Language learning backed by unparalleled global research</strong></h2><p> Our integration with the GSL reaffirms our commitment to providing an unmatched learning experience.</p><p> As we blend Mondly’s interactive platform with Pearson’s expertise, we promise “language learning backed by unparalleled global research”.
