Regardless of age. That we already discussed. Now, if you <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >looked into it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you saw that there are studies that show how <strong>bilingual children outperform monolingual children in math, social studies, reading, memory tests, and many other areas.</strong> The bottom line is that learning a second language at an early age is not bad – as many would think. On the contrary! But the question we ask ourselves today is: how and why do <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >children learn <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> foreign languages so easily?</p><p> Well, scientists claim that everything is about the brain and the stimulation it receives.<strong>Biologically, a child’s brain is prepared for learning.</strong> It is literally built to absorb information. You probably already noticed that if you lived with a small child for more than a month. But science also discovered that <strong>there’s a <a class="link"   href="https://www.forbes.com/2005/10/19/chomsky-noam-language-learning-comm05-cx%5Fde%5F1024chomsky.html#6f9b7f1f11e2" >‘critical period’ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for learning languages</strong> that happens roughly from birth to around puberty.</p><p>Fascinating, isn’t it? Let’s find out more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kids-cognitive-advantages-1024x682.jpg"                      alt="kids congnitive advantages" title="How Do Children Learn Foreign Languages So Easily? 2"                ></p><p> “Little girl reading” by Jonathan Borba©</p><h2 id="How-do-toddlers-learn-languages"><a href="#How-do-toddlers-learn-languages" class="headerlink" title="How do toddlers learn languages?"></a>How do toddlers learn languages?</h2><p> Babies aren’t born British, American, Portuguese, French, Spanish, or Turkish. I mean… they practically are, but, in fact, they aren’t. Being born in Germany doesn’t make you <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >fluent in German <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . But thanks to your brain’s architecture, <strong>you gradually familiarize yourself with the language you were born into.</strong> You may not remember this process, but you learned your native language. You were not born knowing in.</p><p> Now, did it ever happen to you to live for a few days in a foreign country and then come back home and still hear the language that was spoken there? Even though people around you spoke your native language? Well, your brain got used to that language and kept hearing it. Isn’t that fascinating? That’s how important it is to get used to hearing a language. It is almost the same for babies.</p><p> But then, around one year of age, the brain’s capacity for change starts to decrease. As the baby gets used to the sound of the language his parents are speaking, the brain is slowly starting to lose the ability to recognize sounds from other languages.</p><p> Basically, as a baby, you start off with an impeccable slate. You are open to learning everything new – especially languages – because now<strong>your brain is more open than ever to new sounds.</strong> In the first few months, you listen – this is a crucial period during which the brain grows accustomed to the language – and then you slowly start to imitate the sounds you heard or still hear.</p><p> All these incredible processes are possible thanks to the brain and the amazing changes that happen inside it. To give you a glimpse of how important it is, hear this: during the first few years of your life, more than 1 million new neural connections are formed in the brain every single second.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/critical-period-learning-kids-1024x819.jpg"                      alt="critical period learning kids" title="How Do Children Learn Foreign Languages So Easily? 3"                ></p><p> “Discovering the world” by Colin Maynard©</p><h2 id="Understanding-the-process-the-cognitive-advantages-of-kids"><a href="#Understanding-the-process-the-cognitive-advantages-of-kids" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the process: the cognitive advantages of kids"></a>Understanding the process: the cognitive advantages of kids</h2><p> All around this whole wide world, there are many kids who learn two languages at the same time starting from the first or second year of their life. Studies have shown that they can distinguish between the two languages they learn even before they speak the first word namely because they begin life with a tendency for <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology" >phonology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> acquisition. That’s incredible!</p><p> Then there’s <a class="link"   href="https://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash-english.html" >Stephen Krashen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ‘s theory that states that <strong>while adults <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn languages <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , children acquire them.</strong> In other words, adults consciously learn about a language using vocabulary lessons, grammar rules and so on; and children gradually know the language better and better through speaking. How is that possible? Well, there’s a major difference between how these two generations assimilate language information. Let’s see.</p><p> Let’s think of listening to a song that you like, but you really, really like (pun intended). If you really, really like it, you will listen to this song more than a few times and soon enough you’ll know the rhythm and the lyrics by heart with no effort whatsoever. That’s what’s called unconscious learning – a process similar to how children learn languages.</p><p> On the other hand, when you study for a test, retaining information is not nearly as easy. And that happens because <strong>you make a conscious effort to learn – a process that makes it more difficult for your brain to gather information.</strong></p><p> If you want to dive into it and find some scientific research to back this up, you’ll probably discover Dr. Paul Thompson’s <a class="link"   href="http://users.loni.usc.edu/~thompson/MEDIA/press%5Frelease.html" >study <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at UCLA. With this study, researchers observed that to acquire languages, <strong>children use a part of their brain called the “deep motor area”,</strong> an area that also controls unconscious actions like signing your name or riding a bike. This is why they pick up words and phrases without much effort – the same we do with songs. The conclusion of the study was, unsurprisingly, that language acquisition is second nature to children.</p><p> Furthermore, as we already discussed, <strong>the brain’s plasticity and structure change completely by the time we reach puberty.</strong> We become more skilled at complex thought and intellectual learning and we begin to process information differently. Our brain doesn’t focus on language learning as much as it did a few years back. Instead, it developed in other ways and language learning is now processed through mechanisms intended for general learning.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/brain-stimulation-in-children-1024x684.jpg"                      alt="brain stimulation in children" title="How Do Children Learn Foreign Languages So Easily? 4"                ></p><p> “Reading with dad” by Picsea©</p><h2 id="Stimulation-and-environment"><a href="#Stimulation-and-environment" class="headerlink" title="Stimulation and environment"></a>Stimulation and environment</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Learning a new language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> may seem like a piece of cake for children, but there are also other factors – like stimulation and environment – that influence their success in speaking a second language like fluent speakers.</p><p> Speaking about the importance of stimulation in a child’s life, the Harvard University <a class="link"   href="https://developingchild.harvard.edu/resources/inbrief-science-of-ecd/" >Center on the Developing Child <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> claims that <strong>when babies reach out for interaction through gestures, facial expressions, or babbling and get no answer in response – “or if the responses are unreliable or inappropriate” – the brain’s structure does not form as expected and this can lead to disparities in learning and behavior.</strong></p><p> On the other hand, the environment is just as important. It is true that children have cognitive advantages over adults, but they also have a lot of time on their hands and no worries on their minds. Besides, they are not afraid to make mistakes. As you probably know, it is much easier to learn a language if you’re comfortable sounding foolish or making mistakes. Most adults feel anxious when they need to talk in a foreign language, but children just go at it! They make mistakes, they invent new words, they laugh and then try again. So, if you want your children to learn a second language, try to keep it that way. Don’t laugh at them when they make a mistake, and keep their environment stress-free.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/how-do-children-learn-foreign-languages-so-easily/&t=How+Do+Children+Learn+Foreign+Languages+so+Easily?"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="You-can-now-learn-a-new-language-as-fast-as-a-toddler"><a href="#You-can-now-learn-a-new-language-as-fast-as-a-toddler" class="headerlink" title="You can now learn a new language as fast as a toddler"></a>You can now learn a new language as fast as a toddler</h3><p> It can be really tricky to learn a new language in your adult years.

Let’s be serious. ‘Obsessed’ is a light word. If BTS made me think about learning Korean, Squid Game outright bought my subscription to <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-6194&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6194?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ko&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6194?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ko" >learn Korean <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> It’s Netflix’s biggest ever series launch and it’s bloody… splendid. The world loves it. In fact, people love it so much that more and more of them want to learn Korean. It’s not just me or just you. It’s the whole world. Squid Game literally took the world by storm.</p><p> The only problem is that the meaning of some scenes in Squid Game seems to have been changed by subtitles. Ever since the show’s official release in September, Korean-speaking fans have been sharing Squid Game mistranslations all over Twitter and TikTok.</p><p>So what’s there to be done?</p><p> Easy. What everybody else has been doing:<strong>learn Korean and never get lost in translation ever again.</strong></p><h2 id="There’s-an-entire-‘Korean-wave’-behind-Squid-Game-Parasite-and-BTS"><a href="#There’s-an-entire-‘Korean-wave’-behind-Squid-Game-Parasite-and-BTS" class="headerlink" title="There’s an entire ‘Korean wave’ behind Squid Game, Parasite and BTS"></a>There’s an entire ‘Korean wave’ behind Squid Game, Parasite and BTS</h2><p> This is not the first time Korean culture blew our minds. If you haven’t lived under a rock, you already know that there’s so much more to it. Just two years ago, we marveled at the brilliance of Parasite, the Korean masterpiece that won four Oscars.</p><p> Then there’s also BTS, the South Korean boy band also known as the Bangtan Boys. When I wrote about the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Korean alphabet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , many people commented on how much they loved their music. Dubbed ‘Princes of Pop’, the BTS members are the youngest ever to receive the Order of Cultural Merit from the South Korean President due to their contributions in spreading the Korean language and culture.</p><p> The list could go on and on with the <strong>fascinating craze around Korean skincare products, the K-dramas, the K-pop songs and the Korean comics also known as manhwa.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/squid-game-korean-960x539.jpg"                      alt="squid game korean netflix" title="Obsessed With Squid Game, But Lost In Translation? Learn Korean 5"                ></p><p> ‘Squid Game on Netflix’ by Jonas Augustin©</p><p> So with Squid Game, all that the Korean culture did was to prove once again its hypnotic power over us. If you think about it, this is a whole new world beyond our own. Beyond the pop culture we already know. A whole new world we’re all eager to explore. For me, it’s all about the movies. My passion for cinema has never been the same again after watching the Korean film Oldboy. And this is just an example. Korean cinema is more than rich in masterpieces.</p><p> Now, this global phenomenon even has its own name. <strong>The cultural boom coming from South Korea since the 1990s is known today as the Korean wave or <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean%5Fwave" >hallyu <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</strong> Basically, everything we love about Korean pop culture is embedded in hallyu.</p><h2 id="Why-Squid-Game-got-lost-in-translation"><a href="#Why-Squid-Game-got-lost-in-translation" class="headerlink" title="Why Squid Game got lost in translation"></a>Why Squid Game got lost in translation</h2><p> Not everyone will get this, but can you imagine how sad it is to be lost in translation without Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray?</p><p> Jokes aside, we all know translation has its risks. If you’re not in the know with the <a class="link"   href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58787264" >news <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Korean-speaking fans of Squid Game claim that the closed-caption subtitles in English are ‘so bad’ that the original meaning is often lost.</p><p> So something amazing happened. The English subtitles were mistranslated here and there, but the world still loves Squid Game. Now imagine how even more awesome the hit show could have been with the right subtitles. Or if people knew Korean themselves and didn’t need subtitles at all. Fascinating thought.</p><p> The question remains: if not even Netflix, the billion-dollar streaming service, could offer viewers a top-notch translation from Korean, then who can?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/learn-korean-960x640.jpg"                      alt="korean culture" title="Obsessed With Squid Game, But Lost In Translation? Learn Korean 6"                ></p><p> ‘Korean women’ by zero take©</p><p> To be completely honest, some things are culturally difficult to explain and understand when it comes to translation. The Squid Game situation became notorious due to the show’s popularity, but this is not an isolated case. You may not be aware, but many other foreign-language movies and series are facing the same problem. Because of length and cultural particularities, subtitles can never be 100% accurate.</p><p>So there’s only one conclusion we can draw from this…</p><p><strong>Like Thanos, getting lost in translation is inevitable.</strong></p><h2 id="Learn-Korean-and-overcome-the-one-inch-tall-barrier-of-subtitles"><a href="#Learn-Korean-and-overcome-the-one-inch-tall-barrier-of-subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Learn Korean and overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles"></a>Learn Korean and overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles</h2><p> It’s amazing how people learn languages for love. There’s no greater drive than love. And I’m not talking just about romantic love. The fact that so many people are learning Korean after they watched Squid Game, it’s an act of love. All these people learn Korean out of love for this show. Others have been learning the language out of love for BTS. You could even go so far as to say that love makes us smarter. Or better.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/USVF7ZnGqVuoABCBUr/giphy.gif"                      alt="squid game love" title="Obsessed With Squid Game, But Lost In Translation?

Everywhere from the majestic lands of Siberia to the bustling streets of Moscow, people deeply value manners. This profound reverence for courtesy is most evident when exploring the world of<strong>Russian greetings.</strong> Keep reading to understand why.</p><p> Here, just as everywhere else, greetings set the tone for interactions. A mere gesture of using the local Russian language can elevate a simple interaction to a heartfelt connection. Even without mastering the entire language, familiarizing yourself with basic Russian phrases such as “hello”, “good morning”, “please”, “thank you”, or simply “yes” can create welcoming moments and forge bonds.</p><p> In this guide, we will delve into both common and unique Russian greetings. So if you’ve ever wondered how to<strong>greet in Russian</strong> and witness its transformative power, you’re in the right place. Welcome to the heart of Russia, one greeting at a time.</p><h2 id="1-Most-common-Russian-greetings"><a href="#1-Most-common-Russian-greetings" class="headerlink" title="1. Most common Russian greetings"></a>1. Most common Russian greetings</h2><p> Whether you’re planning an expedition, immersing in classic Russian literature, meeting with Russian-speaking friends, or even looking to impress with your language skills, using<strong>Russian greetings</strong> will surely be appreciated. Here are some of the most common ways to say “hello” in Russian:</p><h3 id="Здравствуйте-Zdravstvuyte-Hello-in-Russian"><a href="#Здравствуйте-Zdravstvuyte-Hello-in-Russian" class="headerlink" title="Здравствуйте (Zdravstvuyte): Hello in Russian"></a>Здравствуйте (Zdravstvuyte): Hello in Russian</h3><p><strong>здравствуйте</strong> is the most common Russian greeting. Being slightly formal, yet friendly makes it perfect for greeting people in a professional setting or people you don’t know. Besides, you can also use it to address a group of people as the verb form is meant for formal settings or addressing multiple people.</p><p> Rooted in the phrase “to be healthy and well”, it’s not just a greeting, but a wish for good health.</p><h3 id="Привет-Privyet-Hi-in-Russian"><a href="#Привет-Privyet-Hi-in-Russian" class="headerlink" title="Привет (Privyet): Hi in Russian"></a>Привет (Privyet): Hi in Russian</h3><p><strong>Привет</strong> is the most popular informal Russian greeting. It’s what you would use with your friends – the same way we use “hi” in English. Short, sweet and easy to say!</p><p> If we’re being honest,<strong>здравствуйте</strong> and <strong>Привет</strong> are everything you need when it comes to Russian greetings. If you don’t want to overcrowd your mind, you can stop right here and come back later when you’re ready for more. If you want the full picture of Russian greetings now, let’s continue to discover how Russians say hello to each other.</p><h2 id="2-Time-specific-Russian-greetings"><a href="#2-Time-specific-Russian-greetings" class="headerlink" title="2. Time-specific Russian greetings"></a>2. Time-specific Russian greetings</h2><p> Advanced Russian greetings knowledge means you’re ready to greet people depending on the time of day. Like this:</p><ul><li>Доброе утро_(Dobroye utro)_ : Good morning</li><li>Добрый день_(Dobryy den)_ : Good afternoon</li><li>Добрый вечер_(Dobryy vecher)_ : Good evening</li><li>спокойной ночи_(Spokoynoy nochi)_ : Good night</li></ul><p>Good job, you!</p><p> These phrases are universal and can be used in both formal and informal situations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/themes/mondly/img/mondly-banner-icon.png"                      alt="mondly banner icon" title="Russian Greetings: Common Phrases And Basic Words 2"                ></p><h5 id="Learn-Russian-today"><a href="#Learn-Russian-today" class="headerlink" title="Learn Russian today"></a>Learn Russian today</h5><p> Build practical Russian skills for real life with Mondly.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-2406&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-2406&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-2406&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-2406&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-2406&mt=8" >Start Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="3-Additional-Russian-greetings-Russians-use"><a href="#3-Additional-Russian-greetings-Russians-use" class="headerlink" title="3. Additional Russian greetings Russians use"></a>3. Additional Russian greetings Russians use</h2><p> Now onto less popular greetings. Or let’s call them “specialized”. Sounds better, right? These are the kind of “bonus” Russian greetings you use once you feel more comfortable with the language. Because – let’s be honest: not all words are equally important. You have to focus on the most frequently used ones first.</p><ul><li><strong>Здравствуй (Zdrastvui):</strong> This is an informal variation of Здравствуйте (Zdravstvuyte) (which was the first Russian greeting we presented in this article). It’s best if you use it to address only one person at a time.</li><li><strong>здрасьте (Zdras’te):</strong> Another colloquial and shorter version for Здравствуйте (Zdravstvuyte). It’s what you’d use if you want to sound friendly in an interaction with someone of the same age who you don’t know – the cashier at the store for instance.</li><li><strong>Приветик (Privetik):</strong> This is a very informal and sweet way to say “hi” in Russian. Reserved mostly for female speakers, Приветик (Privetik) is basically the diminutive form of Привет (Privyet).</li><li><strong>Здорово (Zdorovo):</strong> If the previous greeting is reserved for female speakers, this one is more suitable for male speakers. It’s similar to saying “great” or “cool” but can be used as “hi”, “hey” or even “yo” among young friends.</li><li><strong>Приветствую (Privetstvuyu):</strong> This is a Russian word that means “I greet” or “I welcome”. Being more formal makes it perfect for official settings. For instance, you can use it when interacting with business associates or when the degree of formality is unclear. This greeting works for both formal and informal situations, setting it apart from all the other greetings we listed here.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hi-in-russian.jpg"                      alt="hi in russian" title="Russian Greetings: Common Phrases And Basic Words 3"                ></p><h2 id="4-Russian-farewells"><a href="#4-Russian-farewells" class="headerlink" title="4. Russian farewells"></a>4. Russian farewells</h2><p> Goodbyes are just as important as greetings. When you’re taking your leave, you can bid adieu with<strong>До свидания (Do svidaniya)</strong> in Russian, which means “until we see each other again”. Some of the most common Russian farewells include:</p><ul><li><strong>До свидания (Do svidaniya) – Goodbye:</strong> This is applicable to any scenario, either formal or informal. It’s the Здравствуйте (Zdravstvuyte) of Russian goodbyes.</li><li><strong>Пока (Poka)</strong> – Bye: This is the equivalent of Привет (Privyet) for goodbyes, so it’s the perfect choice for informal settings and saying a friendly “bye” to your friends or peers.</li><li><strong>До встречи (Do vstrechi)</strong> – See you soon: This is a bit more formal than Пока (Poka) and technically very similar to До свидания (Do svidaniya). The only difference is that it implies that you actually intend to meet later with the person you’re addressing it to.</li><li><strong>Увидимся (Uvidimsya)</strong> – See you: It’s relatively informal and akin to the English “see you later”. You can tell your friends Увидимся (Uvidimsya) if you expect to meet them again in the near future.</li><li><strong>До скорого (Do skorogo)</strong> – See you soon: It’s a warm farewell, yet rather polite. In practice, it aligns more with “see you” than “see you soon”.</li></ul><h2 id="5-Helpful-phrases-for-greetings"><a href="#5-Helpful-phrases-for-greetings" class="headerlink" title="5. Helpful phrases for greetings"></a>5. Helpful phrases for greetings</h2><p> Now that you said “hello” in Russian, how will the conversation continue? It’s true that locals, including babushkas (grandmothers), will still shower you with hospitality regardless if you speak Russian or not. However, the following basic phrases will further help you to converse in Russian.</p><ul><li><strong>Как дела (Kak dela) – How are you:</strong> This is often used as a greeting in itself. Not just in Russian or English, but in many languages across the globe.</li><li><strong>Как вы поживаете (Kak vy pozhivayete)</strong> – How are you doing: This is the formal version of Как дела (Kak dela) and is best used in formal settings or when addressing multiple people at once.</li><li><strong>Как ты поживаешь (Kak ty pozhivayesh) – How are you doing:</strong> Very similar to the previous one, but rather informal, as it’s best used to address your friends or people you know very well.</li><li><strong>Давно не виделись (Davno ne videlis’)</strong> – Long time no see: This is a great phrase to be used when reuniting with friends.</li><li><strong>Рад тебя видеть (Rad tebya videt’)</strong> – Nice to see you: Perfect as a follow-up to the greetings you just learned, right?</li><li><strong>Как тебя зовут (Kak tebya zovut)</strong> – What is your name: A very useful phrase for first-time encounters.</li><li><strong>Рада познакомиться (Radа poznakomitsya)</strong> – Nice to meet you: Greeting someone for the first time? This is what you should say next.</li><li><strong>Пожалуйста (Pozhaluysta)</strong> – Please</li><li><strong>Спасибо (Spasibo)</strong> – Thank you: Manners matter in every language, so it’s good to add “thank you” in Russian to your repertoire of <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Russian words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li><strong>Прошу прощения (Proshu proshcheniya)</strong> – I’m sorry</li><li><strong>Не за что (Ne za chto)</strong> – You’re welcome</li><li><strong>Извините (Izvinite)</strong> – Excuse me</li><li><strong>Без проблем (Bez problem)</strong> – No problem</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hello-in-russian-960x640.jpg"                      alt="hello in russian" title="Russian Greetings: Common Phrases And Basic Words 4"                ></p><p> Found this interesting?

Here’s what you should keep in mind if you’re meeting with Russian-speaking friends:</p><ul><li><strong>Cheek-kissing:</strong> In many parts of Russia, it’s common to greet close friends and relatives (especially women) with a trio of kisses on alternating cheeks. This might surprise foreigners, but it’s a warm and welcoming gesture.</li><li><strong>Handshakes:</strong> Handshakes are also common, especially among men. When doing so, make sure you make direct eye contact as it reflects respect.</li><li><strong>Using patronymics:</strong> If you know someone’s first name and patronymic (a middle name derived from the father’s first name), it’s polite to use both. For example, if you’re addressing a woman named Maria whose father’s name is Ivan, you’d call her Maria Ivanovna. For men, the ending is usually “ovich” or “evich” – so Ivanovich in this case.</li><li><strong>Genders:</strong> Russian is a gendered language, so adjectives (including those in greetings) will change depending on the gender of the person you’re talking to.</li></ul><p> Whether you are traveling to Russia or engaging in business there, a firm grasp of Russian greetings will always serve you well. As the saying goes, “The first hello can lead to a million things”. So, why not start that journey with a genuine Russian greeting?</p><p> If you feel like you need more information on Russian greetings, here are some frequently asked questions.

Although they don’t make a lot of sense, tongue twisters are very helpful in speech therapy due to their repeated sounds. For this reason, they are used by actors, politicians and even news anchors before going live. Essentially, a tongue twister works like a physical exercise: the more you practice, the better your pronunciation will be.</p><p> According to the <a class="link"   href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/tongue-twister" >Cambridge Dictionary <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a tongue twister is <strong>“a sentence or phrase that is intended to be difficult to say, especially when repeated quickly and often”</strong> .

Did you know that he raps with a whopping speed of 11.4 syllables per second in his song “Rap God”? We don’t know much about rap, but that sure sounds like something only the God of Rap could do.</p><p> But Eminem’s songs and long tongue twisters are challenging for those who are not ready for long runs. Are you? Can you defeat Eminem? Let’s find out. Take a deep breath and try saying the following tongue twister without stopping.</p><ol><li>All I want is a proper cup of coffee.<br> Made in a proper copper coffee pot.<br> You can believe it or not.<br> But I want a cup of coffee from a proper copper pot.<br> Tin coffee pots or iron coffee pots, they’re not good to me.<br> If I can’t have a proper cup of coffee from a proper copper coffee pot, I’ll just have tea.<br> All I want is a proper cup of coffee.<br> Made in a proper copper coffee pot.<br> You can believe it or not.<br> But I want a cup of coffee from a proper copper pot.</li><li>To sit in solemn silence in a dull, dark dock,<br> In a pestilential prison, with a life-long lock,<br> Awaiting the sensation of a short, sharp shock,<br> From a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block!<br> To sit in solemn silence in a dull, dark dock,<br> In a pestilential prison, with a life-long lock,<br> Awaiting the sensation of a short, sharp shock,<br> From a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block!<br> A dull, dark dock, a life-long lock,<br> A short, sharp shock, a big black block!<br> To sit in solemn silence in a pestilential prison,<br> And awaiting the sensation<br> From a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block!</li><li>Betty Botter bought some butter but, said she, the butter’s bitter.<br> If I put it in my batter, it will make my batter bitter.<br> But a bit of better butter will make my bitter batter better.<br> So she bought some better butter, better than the bitter butter,<br> put it in her bitter batter, made her bitter batter better.<br> So ‘t was better Betty Botter bought some better butter.</li><li>I’m a mother pheasant plucker, I pluck mother pheasants.<br> I’m the most pleasant mother pheasant plucker to ever pluck a mother pheasant.<br> I’m not the pheasant plucker I’m the pheasant plucker’s wife, I’ve been plucking Mother pheasants my whole pheasant plucking life.<br> I’m not the pheasant plucker I’m the pheasant plucker’s mate, I’m only plucking Pheasants ’cause the pheasant plucker’s late.</li><li>A tree-toad loved a she-toad<br> Who lived up in a tree.<br> He was a two-toed tree-toad,<br> But a three-toed toad was she.<br> The two-toed tree-toad tried to win<br> The three-toed she-toad’s heart,<br> For the two-toed tree-toad loved the ground<br> That the three-toed tree-toad trod.<br> But the two-toed tree-toad tried in vain;<br> He couldn’t please her whim.<br> From her tree-toad bower,<br> With her three-toed power,<br> The she-toad vetoed him.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/long-tongue-twisters-960x640.jpg"                      alt="&#39;Long tongue twisters&#39; by Mona Eendra©" title="100 Tongue Twisters To Perfect Pronunciation In English 3"                ></p><ol><li>Mr. See owned a saw.<br> And Mr. Soar owned a seesaw.<br> Now, See’s saw sawed Soar’s seesaw<br> Before Soar saw See,<br> Which made Soar sore.<br> Had Soar seen See’s saw<br> Before See sawed Soar’s seesaw,<br> See’s saw would not have sawed<br> Soar’s seesaw.<br> So See’s saw sawed Soar’s seesaw.<br> But it was sad to see Soar so sore<br> just because See’s saw sawed<br> Soar’s seesaw.</li><li>Ned Nott was shot and Sam Shott was not.<br> So it is better to be Shott than Nott.<br> Some say Nott was not shot.<br> But Shott says he shot Nott.<br> Either the shot Shott shot at Nott was not shot,<br> Or Nott was shot.<br> If the shot Shott shot shot Nott, Nott was shot.<br> But if the shot Shott shot shot Shott,<br> Then Shott was shot, not Nott.<br> However, the shot Shott shot shot not Shott, but Nott.</li><li>Theophilus Thistle, the Thistle Sifter,<br> Sifted a sieve of unsifted thistles.<br> If Theophilus Thistle, the Thistle Sifter,<br> Sifted a sieve of unsifted thistles,<br> Where is the sieve of un-sifted thistles<br> Theophilus Thistle, the Thistle Sifter, sifted?</li><li>A flea and a fly in a flue<br> Said the fly “Oh what should we do”<br> Said the flea” Let us fly<br> Said the fly “Let us flee”<br> So they flew through a flaw in the flue.</li><li>Of all the felt I ever felt,<br> I never felt a piece of felt<br> which felt as fine as that felt felt,<br> when first I felt that felt hat’s felt.</li></ol><h2 id="Hard-tongue-twisters"><a href="#Hard-tongue-twisters" class="headerlink" title="Hard tongue twisters"></a><strong>Hard tongue twisters</strong></h2><p> While we’re at it, we can help but wonder what the<strong>hardest tongue twister</strong> in existence is. Contrary to popular belief, it’s not supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.</p><p> At one point, <strong>“the sixth sick sheikh’s sixth sheep’s sick” held the Guinness World Record for the hardest twister,</strong> but since the category no longer exists, the title was probably revoked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hard-tongue-twisters-960x640.jpg"                      alt="&#39;Hard tongue twisters&#39; by Daniel Sandoval©" title="100 Tongue Twisters To Perfect Pronunciation In English 4"                ></p><p> Don’t worry though!

In 2013, MIT‌ researchers concluded that <strong>“pad kid poured curd pulled cod” is the hardest tongue twister in the world.</strong> In fact, Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, an MIT psychologist, says you will get a prize if you manage to say that 10 times quickly.

Because nothing is as genuine as a traveling experience where you’re talking to the locals in their mother tongue. Therefore, let’s help you get ready for your Italian trip with these 100+<strong>Italian phrases</strong> every traveler needs to know.

We always associate visiting new places with pleasant feelings. However, emergencies do happen sometimes whether we like it or not.

Make sure you learn these key<strong>Italian phases</strong> by heart because you know what they say: it’s always better to be safe than sorry.</p><ul><li>Help! –<em>Aiuto!</em></li><li>I feel very sick. –<em>Mi sento molto male.</em></li><li>I need a doctor. –<em>Ho bisogno di un medico.</em></li><li>Where is the hospital? –<em>Dov’è l’ospedale?</em></li><li>Can you help me? –<em>Può aiutarmi?</em></li><li>Where can I find a taxi? –<em>Dove posso trovare un taxi?</em></li><li>Where is the toilet? –<em>Dov’è la toilette?</em></li><li>Where is the bus station, please? –<em>Dov’è la stazione degli autobus, per favore?</em></li><li>Where can I buy tickets? –<em>Dove posso comprare i biglietti?</em></li><li>Where is a pharmacy? –<em>Dov’è una farmacia?</em></li><li>Where is a supermarket? –<em>Dov’è un supermercato?</em></li><li>Where is a good restaurant? –<em>Dov’è un buon ristorante?</em></li><li>Drive me to this address. –<em>Mi porti a questo indirizzo.</em></li><li>Please stop here. –<em>Si fermi qui, per favore.</em></li><li>Please wait a moment. –<em>Aspetti un momento, per favore.</em></li><li>I’ll be back immediately. –<em>Ritorno subito.</em></li></ul><h2 id="3-Italian-phrases-for-food-lovers"><a href="#3-Italian-phrases-for-food-lovers" class="headerlink" title="3.

The same places you visited during the day may reveal themselves differently during the night. Take_<strong>Fontana di Trevi</strong>_ for example. Nothing is as majestic as this world-famous Baroque fountain at night.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/common-italian-phrases-1024x682.jpg"                      alt="common italian phases" title="100+ Essential Italian Travel Phrases For Your Trip 4"                ></p><p> “Fontana di Trevi” by Ivan Bertona©</p><ul><li>Is there a pub here? –<em>C’è un pub qui vicino?</em></li><li>Would you like to dance? –<em>Vorresti ballare?</em></li><li>Are tickets for the theatre still available? –<em>Ci sono ancora biglietti per il teatro?</em></li><li>Are tickets for the football game still available? –<em>Ci sono ancora biglietti per la partita di calcio?</em></li><li>Can you get me a ticket? –<em>Può procurarmi un biglietto?</em></li><li>How much does a ticket cost? –<em>Quanto costa un biglietto?</em></li><li>One ticket, please. –<em>Un biglietto, per favore.</em></li><li>Are there seats available? –<em>Ci sono posti disponibili?</em></li></ul><h2 id="6-Italian-phrases-about-love"><a href="#6-Italian-phrases-about-love" class="headerlink" title="6.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Be-Bilingual-Today-Learn-German-From-Popular-Show-Dark"><a href="#Be-Bilingual-Today-Learn-German-From-Popular-Show-Dark" class="headerlink" title="Be Bilingual Today! Learn German From Popular Show, Dark"></a>Be Bilingual Today! Learn German From Popular Show, Dark</h2><p> I guess we can all agree on the fact Netflix is awesome. It personally makes me a bit antisocial because I often prefer to zombie-watch a series rather than go out, but let’s face it: if I would really – but REALLY – want to go out, I just would. But I don’t. I’m Netflix’s slave and I enjoy it.</p><p> As a matter of fact, watching carefully selected movies and TV shows has its perks. If you are a <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >movie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> geek (like me), then you know that you can sometimes fool people into thinking you are quite smart using only facts that you’ve learned from movies. Just add a bit of emotional intelligence and you’ve got yourself a little alter ego genius.</p><p> For instance, a foreign language is the kind of thing you can learn by watching certain TV shows or movies. That’s no fiction or lie. Because I was born in Europe, I can assure you that many of us learned English by watching cartoons in the early ’90s and that was some fun language training.</p><p> Back to our point of interest, Netflix has done it again with its first German-language original series called <a class="link"   href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5753856/?ref_=ttep_ep_tt" >Dark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . As <a class="link"   href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/1/16724852/netflix-dark-review-first-german-streaming-series" >The Verge <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> beautifully said: “Dark is hard to watch and impossible to stop watching”. That is why this show is guaranteed to make you crave more: more Dark and more German. The first season saw the thirst of Netflix’s subscribers in December 2017 and the next one began production a few weeks ago, on June 25. We will hopefully be able to watch the second season of this dark beauty – got that? – in early 2019.</p><p>Here’s the official trailer for the first season:</p><h2 id="The-Upside-Down-has-nothing-on-Winden"><a href="#The-Upside-Down-has-nothing-on-Winden" class="headerlink" title="The Upside Down has nothing on Winden"></a>The Upside Down has nothing on Winden</h2><p> Dark resembles Stranger Things a LOT. But it’s definitely better. If you are one of those people that would always prefer a European indie instead of a Hollywood blockbuster, Dark it’s just what you need. Filled with gorgeous shots, intense storytelling, and the perfect music, the German TV series sends shivers down your spine if you watch it at night when you are home alone.</p><p>While being indeed very similar to Stranger Things, Dark is at the same time very different in its complexity. If Stranger Things offers a visualization of the evil forces that rule Hawkins, Dark keeps you – and Winden (the city where the action takes place) – in total darkness for a long time. Using sound, rain, and a specific color palette, this series manages to achieve a sense of claustrophobia in the viewer. The screen is not a barrier anymore. It basically makes you fear the unknown. Baran bo Odar – the creator – uses the expectations people built watching these genres (thriller or horror) to induce a sense of anticipation every time a certain type of music can be heard in the background and that’s pretty amazing.</p><h2 id="What-is-Dark-all-about"><a href="#What-is-Dark-all-about" class="headerlink" title="What is Dark all about?"></a>What is Dark all about?</h2><p> The disappearance of two children in a Dark German town where some guy committed suicide seems to expose everything about the relationships among four families. The best part? Temporal loops. Maybe the best question the series offers is “when” and not “where”. And I’m gonna stop right there because I don’t want to ruin it for you.</p><p> Oh! Almost forgot! There’s also some young romantic tension involved. So far, so good. I mean… it has everything, doesn’t it?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xUOxfhJk0NqRxEiCOY/giphy.gif"                      alt="NETFLIX DARK GERMAN LANGUAGE" title="Learn German With Dark On Netflix 2"                ></p><h2 id="Why-am-I-going-to-love-the-German-language-after-watching-Dark"><a href="#Why-am-I-going-to-love-the-German-language-after-watching-Dark" class="headerlink" title="Why am I going to love the German language after watching Dark?"></a>Why am I going to love the German language after watching Dark?</h2><p> It’s a bit complicated and I’m going to shed some light on that in a minute. I don’t know how it is for you, but society and entertainment always seem to maintain and even solidify our preconceptions about the German language. Hitler spoke German. World War II started when Germany did what it did. We get it. But why do we keep putting a tag on Germany and Germans for that? Why do we live in the past? I’ve met a lot of people who associated the sound of the German language with the war. Is it the same for you? We have a lot of preconceptions, but this one is particularly hard to break.</p><p> The only way we will change the preconception we created is by getting in contact with Germany and the German language. And I’ve got to tell you: watching Dark is a great way to do that. It will blow your mind and you will become an instant fan of German cinema.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xUOxf8OrAxtKl1zlT2/giphy.gif"                      alt="JONAS DARK NETFLIX" title="Learn German With Dark On Netflix 3"                ></p><p> I personally wanted to learn German for a long time, but I would always give up on the second day.

It’s the same as falling in love. You have to click. Just imagine my enthusiasm when I understood the first German word while watching Dark! A few months after finishing the series I’m still <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-1866&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-1866?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=de&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-1866?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=de" >learning German with Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Like it did for me. As I said, a good selection of movies and series can change you completely. You can never be the same after watching Cloud Atlas, Vanilla Sky, or Prisoners. Check it for yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohs80N543Ccmt68x2/giphy.gif"                      alt="DARK GERMAN LANGUAGE" title="Learn German With Dark On Netflix 4"                ></p><p> But what are the best online language courses?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Communicating-in-Silent-Italy-Hand-Gesture-Basics"><a href="#Communicating-in-Silent-Italy-Hand-Gesture-Basics" class="headerlink" title="Communicating in Silent Italy: Hand Gesture Basics"></a>Communicating in Silent Italy: Hand Gesture Basics</h2><p> The Italian hand gestures are considered the essence of the Italian language. You don’t really speak Italian if you don’t use your hands too. That’s why anyone who wishes to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >speak Italian <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like_un italiano vero_ needs to go beyond the famous ‘finger purse’ sign. Italians and gestures go together like mozzarella and pizza and you should too.</p><p> For example, did you know that Italians use about 250 hand gestures on a daily basis? And no, that’s not a typo. Italians’ hands don’t like to keep still. However, only a handful_(wink)_ of these are <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >essential to most Italian <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> conversations. And even though it’s not entirely correct, many online charts combine together both popular and obscure gestures. For this reason, I took it upon myself to make<strong>the real top 10 most popular Italian gestures</strong> – a top that includes only signs or gestures that Italians use regularly.</p><h2 id="Italian-hand-gestures-meaning-and-usage"><a href="#Italian-hand-gestures-meaning-and-usage" class="headerlink" title="Italian hand gestures meaning and usage"></a>Italian hand gestures meaning and usage</h2><p> The following Italian gestures are the key to a better understanding of colloquial Italian. To help you fully comprehend their meaning, I also included their origin and the proper context in which they should be used. Let’s start with the least popular gesture and build our way up to the most popular one.</p><h3 id="10-The-“Are-you-afraid-”-gesture"><a href="#10-The-“Are-you-afraid-”-gesture" class="headerlink" title="10. The “Are you afraid?” gesture"></a>10. The “Are you afraid?” gesture</h3><p> This one is similar to the more popular ‘finger purse’ gesture, but all five fingers should open and close repeatedly.</p><p><strong>How to do it:</strong> stretch your fingertips and gather them in order to form a pinecone. Then, keep your hand steady while repeatedly opening and closing your fingers in the pinecone position.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/are-you-afraid-italian-gesture-960x833.jpg"                      alt="are you afraid italian gesture" title="Top 10 Italian Hand Gestures Italians Use All The Time 12"                ></p><p> The ‘Are you afraid?’ gesture</p><p><strong>When to do it:</strong> when you challenge someone to do something dangerous or when someone is afraid to do something and you want to tease them.</p><p><strong>What to say:</strong> <em>Paura, eh?</em> (“You are scared, aren’t you?”);<em>Hai paura?&#x2F;Hai strizza?</em> (“Are you afraid?”)</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> funnily enough, the most common theory could be considered inappropriate and I shall not disclose it here. Google is a big place, though. I’m sure you’ll manage 🤭.</p><h3 id="9-The-“stealing”-gesture"><a href="#9-The-“stealing”-gesture" class="headerlink" title="9. The “stealing” gesture"></a>9. The “stealing” gesture</h3><p><strong>How to do it:</strong> lower the palm and move all your fingers towards the palm, starting with the little finger and finishing with the index while also slowly moving the wrist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/stealing-sign-960x831.jpg"                      alt="stealing sign" title="Top 10 Italian Hand Gestures Italians Use All The Time 13"                ></p><p> The ‘stealing’ gesture</p><p><strong>When to do it:</strong> when you want to tell a friend you want to steal something (not literally, might just be a cookie from the jar!) or you want to point out that someone stole or took something.</p><p><strong>What to say:</strong> actually nothing. You don’t want to get caught! This is probably the only Italian hand gesture that doesn’t need to be accompanied by an <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >expression <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> this gesture symbolizes something ‘magically’ disappearing.</p><h3 id="8-The-“I-can’t-stand-you”-gesture"><a href="#8-The-“I-can’t-stand-you”-gesture" class="headerlink" title="8. The “I can’t stand you” gesture"></a>8. The “I can’t stand you” gesture</h3><p><strong>How to do it:</strong> put your flat hand and forearm horizontally against your stomach.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/i-cant-stand-you-italian-gesture-960x766.jpg"                      alt="i can&#39;t stand you italian gesture" title="Top 10 Italian Hand Gestures Italians Use All The Time 14"                ></p><p> The ‘I can’t stand you’ gesture</p><p><strong>When to do it:</strong> when you can’t stand the person you’re talking to or a third person you’re talking about. It’s actually pretty funny and not necessarily a rude sign.</p><p><strong>What to say:</strong> <em>Mi stai qui</em> (literally “You are here”, figuratively “I can’t stand you”)</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> the gesture indicates a very specific part of your body that’s just above your stomach and it’s usually accompanied by the phrase “you&#x2F;he&#x2F;she is here”. It means that you cannot “digest” that person, just like you cannot digest the food that your body rejects or you don’t like.</p><h3 id="7-The-“Oh-please-”-gesture-the-‘prayer-clasp’"><a href="#7-The-“Oh-please-”-gesture-the-‘prayer-clasp’" class="headerlink" title="7. The “Oh, please!” gesture (the ‘prayer clasp’)"></a>7. The “Oh, please!” gesture (the ‘prayer clasp’)</h3><p> Italy is a very religious country and a common gesture is to join both your hands like you are praying. This can communicate both a wish for something to happen or your desire for something to do or to stop doing something.</p><p><strong>How to do it:</strong> join hands. If your hands and arms are still, it means that you hope something good is going to happen or you’re asking something of someone (begging). If you move your arms while keeping your hands joined in this position, the meaning is still “please” but in the ironic sense of “oh, please&#x2F;come on&#x2F;stop it”. This expresses disagreement or disappointment in the situation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/prayer-clasp-960x729.jpg"                      alt="prayer clasp" title="Top 10 Italian Hand Gestures Italians Use All The Time 15"                ></p><p> The ‘prayer clasp’</p><p><strong>What to say:</strong> <em>Ti prego!</em> (“Oh, please!”),<em>Ma dai!</em> (“Come on!”),<em>Ma fammi il piacere!</em> (“Be serious!”)</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> you are basically praying or hoping for something to happen or someone to stop doing something. It’s a very common gesture. The word ‘please’ in Italian is translated with_(ti) prego_ which literally means “I pray”.</p><h3 id="6-The-“I-don’t-know”-hands"><a href="#6-The-“I-don’t-know”-hands" class="headerlink" title="6. The “I don’t know” hands"></a>6. The “I don’t know” hands</h3><p><strong>How to do it:</strong> open your arms and show both palms usually while also raising your shoulders.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/i-dont-know-italian-gesture-960x785.jpg"                      alt="i don&#39;t know italian gesture" title="Top 10 Italian Hand Gestures Italians Use All The Time 16"                ></p><p> The ‘I don’t know’ gesture</p><p><strong>When to do it:</strong> when you want to say that whatever happened is not your fault, it’s not up to you, or simply you know nothing about it.</p><p><strong>What to say:</strong> <em>Io non c’entro (niente), boh!</em> (“I got nothing to do with it!”),<em>Io non ne so niente!</em> (“I know nothing!”),<em>Non lo so</em> (“I know nothing”),<em>E che ne so io?</em> (“what do I know?”)</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> showing the palms of both hands symbolizes a person who has nothing to hide.</p><h3 id="5-The-outstretched-arm"><a href="#5-The-outstretched-arm" class="headerlink" title="5. The outstretched arm"></a>5. The outstretched arm</h3><p>This is a pretty common gesture among angry drivers and football players.</p><p><strong>How to do it:</strong> stretch your arm in front of you (and a little to the side) with your palm facing up and fingers aligned vertically. You can leave it steady or (and that’s a more common variant) quickly move it in a 45 to 90-degree clockwise rotation until the hand is almost over your head.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/outstretched-arm-960x867.jpg"                      alt="outstretched arm" title="Top 10 Italian Hand Gestures Italians Use All The Time 17"                ></p><p> The ‘angry football player’ gesture</p><p><strong>When to do it:</strong> this gesture basically means “get lost!” or “get bent!”. Although it can also be used in a rude way depending on what you are saying, it’s not necessarily an offensive gesture.

The “get out” gesture</h3><p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Flatten all fingers but the thumb, keep your wrist steady and move your other hand up and down at least 3 times (it should be a 90-degree movement). Be careful, though: if done very energetically and accompanied by an angry face, this gesture could be considered rude.</p><p> Additionally, you can also use the other hand to tap the one with the four flattened fingers, or you can raise the entire arm while keeping the four fingers flattened.

Several peoples (Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Normans, French, Spaniards, and Austrians, to name a few) that spoke no common language came to the peninsula and the Italians needed to improvise in order to communicate. That’s how the iconic Italian hand gestures began to appear.</p><p>The rest is history.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/italian-hand-gestures/&t=Top+10+Italian+Hand+Gestures+Italians+Use+All+the+Time"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="From-0-to-conversational-in-Italian"><a href="#From-0-to-conversational-in-Italian" class="headerlink" title="From 0 to conversational in Italian"></a>From 0 to conversational in Italian</h2><p> Now that you are fluent in Italian hand gestures, you can level up to words and phrases.<em>Va bene?</em></p><p> Get the award-winning language learning app Mondly and you’ll start speaking Italian from day 1.</p><p> It can be really tricky to speak Italian fluently if you don’t actively live in Italy.

Some of them would even want to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn German <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> but don’t do it because they find it too intimidating. And we can’t blame them. The internet is loaded with videos of people exaggerating the German pronunciation.</p><p> However, German pronunciation being difficult is just a myth.<em>Oh ja,</em> you read that right. German is actually one of the few languages where pronunciation makes sense. Once you know the rules, all you have to do is flex those pronunciation muscles and speak like a true German. It’s really not as hard as you think. Let’s break the myth together.</p><h2 id="The-basics-of-the-German-alphabet"><a href="#The-basics-of-the-German-alphabet" class="headerlink" title="The basics of the German alphabet"></a>The basics of the German alphabet</h2><p> We’ll naturally start with the basics. Much like English, the German alphabet consists of 26 standard letters. In addition to that, it also features the letter ß – known as the German ligature – and umlauted forms of three vowels: ä, ö and ü. In total,<em>das Alphabet</em> has 8 vowels and 22 consonants.</p><p> Considering you’re already familiar with all the other letters, let’s continue by taking a closer look at these four special letters: ß, ä, ö and ü.</p><h3 id="s-also-known-as-‘sharp-S’-‘eszett’-or-‘scharfes-S’"><a href="#s-also-known-as-‘sharp-S’-‘eszett’-or-‘scharfes-S’" class="headerlink" title="ß also known as ‘sharp S’, ‘eszett’ or ‘scharfes S’"></a>ß also known as ‘sharp S’, ‘eszett’ or ‘scharfes S’</h3><p> Although it looks different from everything you’ve ever seen in English, ß shouldn’t intimidate you. Vaguely resembling a capital ‘B’,<strong>the letter ß is pronounced like a sharp S</strong> (like the ‘s’ in ‘see’) – hence its name ‘eszett’ or ‘scharfes S’.</p><p> German is the only language that uses ß and if the character is unavailable, it can be replaced with ⟨ss⟩. In fact, in Swiss Standard German (used in Switzerland and Liechtenstein), the letter was completed replaced by ⟨ss⟩ sometime in the 20th century.</p><p> Eszett not having a capitalized version sparked debates for a long time, so the Council for German Orthography <a class="link"   href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/bildung/rechtschreibung-das-alphabet-bekommt-einen-neuen-buchstaben-1.3566309" >officially adopted <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> a capital in 2017. The capital of ß is ẞ.</p><h3 id="German-umlauts-a-o-u"><a href="#German-umlauts-a-o-u" class="headerlink" title="German umlauts: ä, ö, ü"></a>German umlauts: ä, ö, ü</h3><p> While highly representative for the German language, the German umlauts are ‘guilty’ of making the most uncommon sounds to English speakers.</p><p> To put it simply, the umlaut – represented by the two dots over a, o and u – indicates that an ‘hidden e’ will follow the vowel in pronunciation:</p><ul><li><strong>ä</strong> will be pronounced as <strong>‘ae’</strong> ;</li><li><strong>ö</strong> will be pronounced as <strong>‘oe’</strong> ;</li><li><strong>ü</strong> will be pronounced as <strong>‘ue’</strong> .</li></ul><p> To give you a better idea of the pronunciation, remember that ä somehow resembles the ‘ai’ sound in ‘air’ and ö is similar to the ‘e’ in ‘her’ or the famous French ‘eu’. With ü things are a little bit easier, because thanks to Müller, you probably already know how to pronounce ü.</p><p>Now round off your lips and start practicing!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/german-alphabet-960x640.jpg"                      alt="german alphabet" title="A Beginner’s Guide To The German Pronunciation &Amp; Alphabet 2"                ></p><h2 id="German-pronunciation-guide-for-single-letters"><a href="#German-pronunciation-guide-for-single-letters" class="headerlink" title="German pronunciation guide for single letters"></a>German pronunciation guide for single letters</h2><p> Now that we’ve settled the matters with ß, ä, ö and ü, it’s time to move on to more familiar letters and see how their pronunciation differs from English.</p><p> Because this is a beginner’s guide on German pronunciation, we won’t overwhelm you with diphthongs or other such ‘scary’ things that might steal your focus. We’ll continue by just simply explaining how to pronounce single letters or certain letter combinations.</p><p> Sounds good? Let’s dive right in. Here’s how to pronounce the German letters that sound different from English:</p><ol><li><strong>R</strong> – Much like the notorious French <em>r</em> , the German <em>r</em> is one of the most distinctive sounds of the language. Many people describe its pronunciation like a gurgling sound. However, this is applicable only for the <em>R</em> s placed at the beginning of a word. Anywhere else, the <em>r</em>  sounds more like an ‘ah’ or ‘uh’. Now try to say <em>Radio</em> like a German.</li><li><strong>W</strong> – The German <em>w</em> sounds like the English ‘v’. Now you know <em>vy some Germans vill talk like zis.</em>  Try it yourself by saying <em>was?</em> (‘what?’).</li><li><strong>V</strong> – Sounds like the English ‘f’. This is why <em>Vater</em> sounds a lot like ‘father’.</li><li><strong>J</strong> – <em>Oh ja,</em> you already know this one! The German <em>j</em> is pronounced like the English ‘y’.</li><li><strong>E</strong> – If you see an <em>e</em> at the end of a German word, make sure to pronounce it like this: ‘eh’. Come on! Loud and clear: <em>Katze</em> (‘cat’)!</li></ol><h2 id="German-pronunciation-guide-for-letter-combinations"><a href="#German-pronunciation-guide-for-letter-combinations" class="headerlink" title="German pronunciation guide for letter combinations"></a>German pronunciation guide for letter combinations</h2><p> Just a few more examples and you’ll soon be ready to speak like a German! Let’s see how you should pronounce certain letter combinations in German:</p><ol><li><strong>CH</strong> – Don’t laugh, but this is best described as a cat-hissing sound. Now try saying <em>Ich</em> (‘I’) or <em>mich</em> (‘my’). However, don’t forget that the sound is usually softer after a consonant.</li><li><strong>EI</strong> – Sounds a lot like the English ‘eye’. Try it by saying <em>einladen</em> (‘to invite’).</li><li><strong>IE</strong>  – You should pronounce this one like a long ‘e’: <em>lieben</em> (‘to love’).</li><li><strong>PF</strong> – Make sure to quickly pronounce both letters as close together as possible. For example: <em>Pfeffer</em> (‘pepper’).</li><li><strong>SP&#x2F;ST</strong> – In both cases you should say <em>sh</em>  (exactly like the English ‘sh’) followed by <em>p</em> or <em>t</em> . Thus, <em>sp</em> will be pronounced <em>shp</em> and <em>st</em> will be pronounced <em>sht</em> . For example:<em>sprechen</em> (‘speak’) or Strauss as in musician Johann Strauss.</li><li><strong>KN</strong> – Although it may sound weird to you as an English speaker, make sure to pronounce both letters: <em>Knabe</em> (‘boy’ or ‘lad’).</li><li><strong>TH</strong> – Sounds like ‘t’. Practice by saying <em>Theorie</em> like this: TAY-oh-ree.</li><li><strong>TSCH</strong> – You already know this one because… <em>Deutsch</em> . As you can see, it is similar to the ‘ch’ in ‘couch’ or ‘check’.</li><li><strong>EU</strong> – Sounds like ‘oy’ in English.</li><li><strong>Z</strong> – Don’t pronounce this like the English ‘z’. Go instead for the ‘ts’ sound in ‘cats’. Try it: <em>Zeitung</em> (‘newspaper’).</li></ol><p> Did you recognize_ze rules_ in this example?</p><h2 id="How-to-pronounce-long-German-words"><a href="#How-to-pronounce-long-German-words" class="headerlink" title="How to pronounce long German words"></a>How to pronounce long German words</h2><p><em>Ja,</em> the German language is famous for its very long words, but once again – this shouldn’t intimidate you. Most <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >German words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are, in fact, compounds.</p><p> So what exactly is a ‘compound’? When two words (or sometimes even more) are used together to create a new meaning, a compound is formed. In English, we use hyphens to make everything easier to read, but German just puts everything tight together.<em>Gute Arbeit, Deutsch!</em> (‘Nice work, German!’) For example,<em>unabhängigkeitserklärungen</em> translates to ‘declarations of independence’ and_nahrungsmittelunverträglichkeit_ may look impossible to remember or pronounce, but it actually means ‘food intolerance’.</p><p> Now, everything you have to do to successfully pronounce these long words is to mentally separate the compound word. Break up the very long word into shorter words and pronounce them using the rules you already know.

This is why we pledged ourselves to give those who need it most the opportunity to learn languages with Mondly Premium for free.</p><p> <strong>One of the causes dearest to our heart is <a class="link"   href="http://www.fundaciondanny.org/" >Fundación Danny <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from Colombia to whom we donated 150 Premium subscriptions in an effort to help them make language learning accessible for Colombian children.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fundacion-danny-mondly-600x450.jpg"                      alt="fundacion danny mondly" title="Helping Those Who Need It Most: Fundación Danny From Colombia 2"                ></p><p> Colombian children attending the Danny Foundation courses.</p><p> Fundación Danny or Danny Foundation has been active since 2011 and its goal is to help children and young people from different places in Colombia to develop skills that can ensure a better future for them and their families. The foundation provides multiple courses from language learning to programming and even playing an instrument.</p><p> Danny Foundation is projected as an Educational Institution that targets children and adolescents from vulnerable strata to give them access to excellent learning standards. Its long term objective is to help these children face the challenges of the working world thus reducing poverty and social inequality.</p><p> <strong>DANNY stands for Developing Aptitudes for a New Nation and Youth.</strong></p><h2 id="Unlocking-the-power-of-social-good"><a href="#Unlocking-the-power-of-social-good" class="headerlink" title="Unlocking the power of social good"></a>Unlocking the power of social good</h2><p> When Andrés Rodríguez, the director of Danny Foundation, first came for our help, we knew right away we had to do it. For the children and adolescents that attend the foundations’ courses, language learning is not just a hobby, but the key to success. This is why we wanted to give them the opportunity to experience the transformational power of learning English with Mondly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/danny-foundation-mondly-468x600.jpg"                      alt="danny foundation mondly" title="Helping Those Who Need It Most: Fundación Danny From Colombia 3"                ></p><p> Graduation at the Danny Foundation.</p><blockquote><p><em>Learning English in Colombia is not an easy task. Schools do teach English but just once or twice per week and sometimes the teachers themselves are not as competent as they should be. So Mondly is a great opportunity for our students to practice English every day.</em></p><p><em>One of our favorite features in the app is the Chatbot because it recreates real situations and allows students to speak English the same way they would do in real life</em> , says Andrés Rodríguez, director of Danny Foundation.</p></blockquote><p> For the time being, there are 200 students aged 8 to 16 years old taking courses at the foundation, but Andrés wants to reach even more places in Colombia. So we want to thank the Danny Foundation for what they are doing on behalf of the youth of Columbia.</p><p> <strong>Whatever the goal, Mondly will always support the Danny Foundation in its endeavor to expand learning for every child in Colombia.</strong></p><ul><li><a class="link"

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Borrowing-Beyond-Borders-Enriched-English-Lexicon"><a href="#Borrowing-Beyond-Borders-Enriched-English-Lexicon" class="headerlink" title="Borrowing Beyond Borders: Enriched English Lexicon"></a>Borrowing Beyond Borders: Enriched English Lexicon</h2><p>&#96;&#96;</p><p>&#96;&#96;</p><p><code>__ Listen</code></p><p>&#96;&#96;</p><p> When the English language started to expand its vocabulary, the process seemed like a wedding ceremony. Do you know how they say brides need something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue? Well, English had all of that except the blue. Anglo-Saxon words were old,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Shakespeare’s words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> were new and all the loanwords from other languages were borrowed. If you can’t put your finger on the <strong>English words borrowed from other languages, think_café, ballet, fiancé, spaghetti, espresso, pretzel._</strong>  You got the point.</p><p> Of course, this story is far from true, but that doesn’t mean it won’t help you remember how the modern English vocabulary came to be. Unexpected connections are a good strategy for remembering new things. Anyway, enough storytelling for now. Let’s see what common words English “took” from other languages.</p><h2 id="Where-did-English-Come-From"><a href="#Where-did-English-Come-From" class="headerlink" title="Where did English Come From?"></a>Where did English Come From?</h2><p> The earliest forms of English, collectively known as Old English or Anglo-Saxon, developed from the North Sea Germanic languages that came to Britain between the mid-5th and 7th centuries AD. This linguistic influence made its way to Britain through the migration of the Anglo-Saxons from what is now northwest Germany, southern Denmark, and the Netherlands.</p><p> Not long after that, in the 8th and 9th centuries, Old English began to borrow foreign words from the Old-<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Norse-speaking Viking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> invaders and settlers. Subsequently, in the late 11th century, Middle English emerged, marked by a new influx of borrowed words from Old French following the Norman Conquest of England.</p><p> Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the Renaissance trend of borrowing Latin and Greek words and roots, which also coincided with the Great Vowel Shift. The era culminated in the King James Bible and the works of William Shakespeare.</p><p> While the question may sound funny (“where did English come from?”), it is a popular inquiry among Google users for obvious reasons. After all, 1.3 billion people worldwide speak English either natively or as a second language.

For example, words like “guacamole”, “salsa” and “piñata” have been borrowed into English from Spanish due to the popularity of the Mexican culture in the United States.</p><h2 id="Italian-loanwords-English-words-that-are-actually-Italian"><a href="#Italian-loanwords-English-words-that-are-actually-Italian" class="headerlink" title="Italian loanwords: English words that are actually Italian"></a>Italian loanwords: English words that are actually Italian</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Zucchini</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Spaghetti</td></tr><tr><td>Espresso</td></tr><tr><td>Graffiti</td></tr><tr><td>Fiasco</td></tr><tr><td>Maestro</td></tr><tr><td>Paparazzi</td></tr><tr><td>Volcano</td></tr><tr><td>Scenario</td></tr><tr><td>Finale</td></tr><tr><td>Piano</td></tr><tr><td>Concerto</td></tr><tr><td>Soprono</td></tr><tr><td>Fresco</td></tr><tr><td>Gelato</td></tr><tr><td>Falsetto</td></tr><tr><td>Latte</td></tr><tr><td>Barista</td></tr><tr><td>Broccoli</td></tr><tr><td>Panini</td></tr><tr><td>Crescendo</td></tr><tr><td>Balcony</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Thanks to Italy’s cultural influence throughout history, especially during the Renaissance period, many languages borrowed its words.

Many sources agree that<strong>the English language consists of roughly 470,000 words.</strong> However, most linguists advise to take that with a pinch of salt. While some words have become obsolete, new additions are always making their way into the English vocabulary, so it’s difficult to put our finger on an exact number. Then, there’s also the question of different variations of a single word like “go”, “went”, “gone”. Do we count that as a single word or as three separate ones?</p><p> One thing is certain: the English vocabulary is still expanding. As you know, English does not only borrow words from other languages, but it also constantly coins new words to reflect advances in technology.</p><p>Loading poll …</p><p>Coming Soon</p><p> Do you believe the claim that ~80% of the English vocabulary is borrowed from other languages?</p><p> Yes, English is a linguistic melting pot.

Sure, it does help you sound more like a native. But first, you should focus on expanding your vocabulary in order to build your confidence while <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learning Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Go with practical and popular notions such as <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Spanish sayings, expressions, or idioms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that the natives use all the time. This way, you’ll add substance and humor to your discourse and sound more believable, authentic, and surely – more like a Spanish native. After all, this is your main goal when <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5924&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5924?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=es&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5924?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=es" >learning Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/" >Oxford Languages <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> defines “saying” as a short, pithy, and commonly known expression that offers wisdom or a piece of advice. Hence, Spanish sayings will not just make you sound like a native, but will also provide insight into Spanish history and culture. This is why learning the most popular sayings is definitely a win-win situation. So let’s dive in and see what Spanish sayings and expressions you can use to sound as if you were Spanish-born.</p><h2 id="Spanish-sayings-with-English-equivalents"><a href="#Spanish-sayings-with-English-equivalents" class="headerlink" title="Spanish sayings with English equivalents"></a>Spanish sayings with English equivalents</h2><p> Spanish sayings are like salt and pepper to your discourse. And like the margarita, the Spanish language is better with a pinch of salt on the rim of the glass. Don’t be too overzealous though. As the English saying goes:<em>one can have too much of a good thing.</em> If you use too many <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >sayings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in your discourse, you could come off as… peculiar.</p><p> Speaking of English sayings, let’s begin with a list of the most popular Spanish sayings that have a clear English correspondent or equivalent. This way, you’ll easily understand how sayings work in Spanish and know right away what is the proper context to use each of them.</p><h3 id="1-Dime-con-quien-andas-y-te-dire-quien-eres"><a href="#1-Dime-con-quien-andas-y-te-dire-quien-eres" class="headerlink" title="1. Dime con quién andas, y te diré quién eres"></a>1. Dime con quién andas, y te diré quién eres</h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> Tell me who you hang out with, and I’ll tell you who you are.</p><p><strong>English equivalent:</strong> Although in English we often use the literal translation too, we are more familiar with the ‘official’ version of this saying:<strong>“tell me who your friends are and I’ll tell you who you are”.</strong> In addition,<strong>“birds of a feather flock together”</strong> has a similar meaning and can be used as an alternative.</p><h3 id="2-No-hay-mal-que-por-bien-no-venga"><a href="#2-No-hay-mal-que-por-bien-no-venga" class="headerlink" title="2. No hay mal que por bien no venga"></a>2. No hay mal que por bien no venga</h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> There’s no bad from which something good doesn’t come.</p><p><strong>English equivalent:</strong> “Every cloud has a silver lining.”</p><p> Absolutely the best Spanish saying you can use to encourage someone to be hopeful even when things are not great.</p><h3 id="3-Mas-vale-tarde-que-nunca"><a href="#3-Mas-vale-tarde-que-nunca" class="headerlink" title="3. Más vale tarde que nunca"></a>3. Más vale tarde que nunca</h3><p><strong>English equivalent:</strong> “Better late than never.”</p><p> This one is pretty straightforward as the literal translation is the same as the English equivalent.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/spanish-expressions-960x638.jpg"                      alt="spanish expressions" title="17 Spanish Sayings That Will Make You Sound Like A Native 2"                ></p><p> “Valldemossa, Spain” by Patrick Baum©</p><h3 id="4-Cuando-el-rio-suena-agua-lleva"><a href="#4-Cuando-el-rio-suena-agua-lleva" class="headerlink" title="4.

Cuando el río suena, agua lleva</h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> When the river makes noise, it’s carrying water.</p><p><strong>English equivalent:</strong> “There’s no smoke without fire.”</p><p> Did you know this one? It means that if there are unpleasant rumors about someone or something, there is probably a good reason for it. Meaning that the rumors are almost always partly true.</p><h3 id="5-Del-tal-palo-tal-astilla"><a href="#5-Del-tal-palo-tal-astilla" class="headerlink" title="5. Del tal palo, tal astilla"></a>5.

El hábito no hace al monje"></a>7. El hábito no hace al monje</h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> The habit doesn’t make the monk.</p><p><strong>English equivalent:</strong> “Clothes do not make the man.” &#x2F; “You can’t judge a book by its cover.”</p><p> Don’t ever judge a person solely by appearances because this is not a reliable indication of the true character of that person. No matter if it’s a positive or a negative bias. You might be surprised.</p><h3 id="8-Mucho-ruido-y-pocas-nueces"><a href="#8-Mucho-ruido-y-pocas-nueces" class="headerlink" title="8. Mucho ruido y pocas nueces"></a>8. Mucho ruido y pocas nueces</h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> Lots of noise and few nuts.</p><p><strong>English equivalent:</strong> “Much ado about nothing.”</p><p> That’s… interesting, Spanish. We bet <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Shakespeare <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would find this funny.</p><p> But it’s not entirely absurd though. Think about the moment you break in a nutshell.

A quien madruga, Dios le ayuda"></a>3. A quien madruga, Dios le ayuda</h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> God helps those who get up early.</p><p><strong>Meaning:</strong> The importance of being diligent and responsible in what we do.</p><p> This Spanish saying has also been found in literary texts such as ‘The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha’. Slightly changed but keeping the same meaning, the phrase appears in the second chapter: “He who does not get up early with the sun does not enjoy the day”.</p><p><strong>How to use it</strong></p><p> <em>– Estoy un poco nervioso para mañana, pero espero que todo salga bien con el nuevo proyecto.</em> (“I’m a little nervous for tomorrow, but I hope all will be well with the new project.”)</p><p><em>– ¡Buena suerte!

Como Pedro por su casa"></a>4. Como Pedro por su casa</h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> Like Pedro in his house.</p><p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Someone who behaves comfortably in a house that is not his own.</p><p> The phrase has a ‘pejorative’ or negative tinge when applied to a person with a haughty and arrogant attitude. The origin of this popular Spanish saying is the conquest of Huesca by King Pedro I of Aragon in the Battle of Alcoraz. It is said that the monarch conquered the city with little resistance from the Muslim troops who had already killed king Sancho Ramírez, Pedro’s father.</p><p> It was an unbelievable victory considering the siege had begun some two years earlier, which is why they praised the ease with which Pedro won this battle. Thus, the Spanish saying ‘<em>entróse como Pedro en Huesca’</em> (“enter like Pedro through Huesca”) was born and, consequently, the expression ‘<em>como Pedro por su casa’.</em></p><p><strong>How to use it</strong></p><p><em>– Tu suegra lleva aquí un tiempo. Supongo que se siente cómoda aquí.</em> (“Your mother-in-law has been here for a while now. I’m guessing she feels comfortable here.”)</p><p><em>– Si, como Pedro por su casa.</em> (“Yes, like Peter in his house.”)</p><h2 id="Spanish-sayings-about-animals"><a href="#Spanish-sayings-about-animals" class="headerlink" title="Spanish sayings about animals"></a>Spanish sayings about animals</h2><p> Sayings about <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >animals are common in any language and Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> makes no exception.

Back in the day, when horses were the most reliable form of transport for everyone, selling and buying a horse was a tough job. Since horses’ teeth change over time, buyers would check the horse in the mouth to make sure the seller is not lying about the age. Naturally, such practice was considered a sign of mistrust towards the seller.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/spanish-idioms-960x720.jpg"                      alt="spanish idioms" title="17 Spanish Sayings That Will Make You Sound Like A Native 5"                ></p><p> “A man and his dog in San Sebastián, Spain” by Lucian Alexe©</p><h3 id="2-Mas-vale-pajaro-en-mano-que-ciento-volando"><a href="#2-Mas-vale-pajaro-en-mano-que-ciento-volando" class="headerlink" title="2.

You don’t have to visit Japan to know that. We all heard about the famously polite<strong>Japanese bow</strong> and about the big emphasis Japanese people place on the respect of hierarchy in the family and etiquette in general. It’s in their DNA. And the same as its culture, the<strong>Japanese language</strong> is one of the most polite languages in the world. It’s true that, as a tourist, you don’t have to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn Japanese <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to perfection, but you know what they say: when in Rome, do as the Romans do and you will certainly increase the enjoyment of your adventure.</p><p> Learning as much as a simple <strong><em>Konnichiwa</em> (“hello” in Japanese)</strong> or <strong><em>Arigato</em> (“thank you” in Japanese)</strong> can work wonders. So here’s a guide to all the<strong>Japanese greetings</strong> you’ll need in your Japanese adventure: from<strong>“hello” in Japanese</strong> to**<em>Moshi Moshi</em>** (used to say “hello” on the phone), goodbye and other<strong>common Japanese greetings.</strong></p><h2 id="1-“Hello”-in-Japanese"><a href="#1-“Hello”-in-Japanese" class="headerlink" title="1. “Hello” in Japanese"></a>1. “Hello” in Japanese</h2><p> If you ever watched at least one anime series, you probably already know this: <strong>“hello” in Japanese is_Konnichiwa_ .</strong> Rings any bell? It most probably does since**<em>Konnichiwa</em>** is undeniably the most<strong>common Japanese greeting.</strong> Thanks to some of the most influential anime of all time such as Dragon Ball Z, Death Note, and Naruto, a lot of people living outside Japan know at least a few <a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875"><strong>words in Japanese</strong></a> and_Konnichiwa_ is definitely one of them.</p><p> But back in the day, when Japanese people met, they would address each other with_konnichi wa gokiken ikaga desu ka?_ (“wow are you feeling today?”),<em>konnichi wa ii hi desu ne</em> (“today is a nice day”) or_kon’nichi wa ikaga desu ka_ (“how is today?”). Over time, these expressions became shorter and shorter until they ultimately transformed to the**<em>Konnichiwa</em>** we all use today to greet each other in Japanese.</p><p> Also, keep in mind that it’s usually only used during the daytime, between morning and evening.</p><p> When it comes to using it in various social contexts, you should know that**<em>Konnichiwa</em>** can be used safely in all kinds of situations (only between morning and evening; never early in the morning or late at night) except for those involving very close friends. It could be a little awkward to use**<em>Konnichiwa</em>** (こんにちは) when meeting your Japanese friends. In this situation, it’s better to use something a lot more informal than that, like:</p><ul><li><em>ossu</em> – used exclusively between male friends and relatives around the same age. It’s similar to “hey dude” or “hey man” in English</li><li><em>yaho</em> – extremely informal, typically used by girls (boys more often say_yo_) but suitable for all the young people</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/honnichiwa-1024x683.jpg"                      alt="honnichiwa" title="Hello In Japanese - All The Japanese Greetings You Need To Know 2"                ></p><p> “Kyoto, Japan” by Sorasak©</p><p> If you have to write<strong>“hello” in Japanese,</strong> there are two ways to do it (three if you also count in Romaji – the romanization of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Japanese writing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> system):</p><p> -using<strong>Kanji symbols:</strong> 今日は</p><p> – using<strong>Hiragana symbols:</strong> こんにちは</p><p> Curious about why there are multiple types of characters in Japanese?

Good morning in Japanese and other relevant greetings"></a>2. Good morning in Japanese and other relevant greetings</h2><p><strong>Good morning in Japanese</strong>   <strong>– O_hayō gozaimasu_</strong>  (おはよう ございます) is the best choice for greeting someone in the early morning hours (before 10:00 a.m.). Unlike_Konnichiwa_ ,   <strong>O_hayō gozaimasu_</strong>  a little more formal, so it’s safe to use it with people you don’t know or when you are meeting people in a position of authority (such as your boss or your teacher).</p><p>This greeting is used both as a “hello” and as a “goodbye”.</p><p><strong>Good evening in Japanese</strong>   <strong>– K_onbanwa_</strong>  (こんばんは) – is how you should greet people in the late afternoon or evening hours. The same as_Ohayō gozaimasu_ , <strong>K_onbanwa_</strong>  can be used both as a “hello” and as a “goodbye”.</p><p> If you are leaving, you can also say_Oyasumi nasai_ (おやすみなさい) to say “goodbye” in Japanese at night. But only when you leave as this Japanese phrase is not typically used as a greeting.</p><p><strong>Good night in Japanese</strong>   <strong>–<em>Oyasuminasai</em></strong>  (おやすみなさい) – is how you greet someone in Japanese if you are leaving at night. This Japanese phrase is not typically used as a greeting, so don’t forget you can’t use it when you meet someone.</p><p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Morning and evening are more carefully delimited in the Japanese culture than in the West. So it’s important to know your**<em>Konnichiwa</em>** and never use it instead of**<em>Konbanwa</em>** or**<em>Oyasuminasai.</em>**</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hi-in-japanese-960x639.jpg"                      alt="hi in Japanese" title="Hello In Japanese - All The Japanese Greetings You Need To Know 3"                ></p><p> “Meguro River, Matsuno, Japan” by Sora Sagano©</p><h2 id="3-“Goodbye”-in-Japanese"><a href="#3-“Goodbye”-in-Japanese" class="headerlink" title="3.“Goodbye” in Japanese"></a>3.“Goodbye” in Japanese</h2><p> Another greeting we borrowed from the Japanese and sometimes use in our day-to-day conversations in English is**<em>Sayōnara</em>** (さよなら), a greeting that carries the connotation of farewell and translates to “goodbye”.</p><p><strong><em>Sayōnara</em></strong> derived from_Sayō naraba_ (“If that’s the way it is”), a phrase that was originally used by people before leaving in a way that would sum up a conversation. Nowadays,<em>Sayōnara</em>  is a semi-formal way to say<strong>“goodbye” in Japanese.</strong></p><p> Although notorious abroad, Japanese people don’t really use_<strong>Sayonara.</strong>_ For informal situations that involve close friends, they prefer using**<em>bai bai</em>** (ばいばい), which translates to – you guessed it – “bye bye” in English,<em>jaa ne</em> (じゃあね) which translates to “see you” or_saraba da_ (さらばだ) which is the equivalent of “adios!”.</p><p> Want more? Here are other ways to say goodbye in Japanese that are suitable for both formal and informal situations:</p><ul><li>I’ll see you later. – <em>Mata aimashou.</em>  (また会いましょう。)</li><li>Take care! – <em>Ki wo tsukete!</em>  (きをつけて！)</li><li>See you tomorrow! – M_ata ashita!_  (またあした！)</li><li>See you soon! – <em>Mata ne!</em>  (またね！)</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/goodbye-in-japanese-1024x683.jpg"                      alt="goodbye in Japanese" title="Hello In Japanese - All The Japanese Greetings You Need To Know 4"                ></p><p> “See you soon, human” by Alain Pham©</p><h2 id="4-“Thank-you”-in-Japanese-and-other-polite-phrases-that-you-should-know"><a href="#4-“Thank-you”-in-Japanese-and-other-polite-phrases-that-you-should-know" class="headerlink" title="4. “Thank you” in Japanese and other polite phrases that you should know"></a>4. “Thank you” in Japanese and other polite phrases that you should know</h2><p> We already settled that the Japanese culture is a culture of respect and politeness. Thus, learning to say<strong>“thank you” in Japanese</strong> is probably one of your most important tasks to complete before visiting Japan. Lucky for you, there’s nothing difficult about that.</p><p> The most casual and common way to say<strong>“thank you” in Japanese</strong> to your family and friends is**<em>Arigatou</em>** (ありがとう). Not “Arigato”. That’s actually a very common misconception about how to write “thank you” in Romaji.</p><p> Japanese people use**<em>Arigatou</em>** the same way we use<strong>“thanks”</strong> , but they also have an even shorter way to express their gratitude within a group of friends:<em>Domo</em> (どうも).<em>Domo</em> translates to “very much”.</p><p> Moving to a slightly formal form,<strong><em>Domo arigatou</em></strong> (どうもありがとう) is the equivalent of<strong>“thank you”.</strong> Careful though! This is not formal enough to be used with someone who is in a position of authority over you.</p><p> If you need a more formal way of<strong>thanking someone in Japanese,</strong> you should use one of these expressions:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Arigatou gozaimasu</em></strong> (ありがとうございます) – thank you very much</li><li><strong><em>Domo arigatou gozaimasu</em></strong> (どうもございまずいます) – an even more polite form for “thank you very much”</li><li><strong><em>Arigatou gozaimashita</em></strong> – suitable for when you want to thank someone for something that he or she did in the recent past</li><li><strong><em>Gochisou sama deshita</em></strong> – use this phrase if you want to thank for your meal. Furthermore, if you want to say that the meal is delicious, you say_Sore wa oishī desu_ (それはおいしいです) – “that’s delicious”.</li></ul><p> If you want to continue the conversation and reply to someone thanking you, you can use these <strong><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Japanese phrases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> :</strong></p><ul><li><em>Dou itashi mashite</em> (どういたしまして) – translates to “you’re welcome”</li><li><em>Iie</em> (いいえ) – instead of_Dou itashi mashite,_ you can say_Iie,_ which means “no” as in “it was nothing”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/arigato-1024x706.jpg"                      alt="arigato" title="Hello In Japanese - All The Japanese Greetings You Need To Know 5"                ></p><p> “Kyoto, Japan” by Andre Benz©</p><h2 id="Don’t-forget-about-the-Japanese-bow"><a href="#Don’t-forget-about-the-Japanese-bow" class="headerlink" title="Don’t forget about the Japanese bow"></a>Don’t forget about the Japanese bow</h2><p> Every<strong>“hello” in Japanese</strong> is usually accompanied by a bow, the Western world equivalent of a handshake. Our advice would be to not skip the bow if you really want to feel like you belong.</p><p><strong>The Japanese bow</strong> is an essential part of the culture of respect and <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette%5Fin%5FJapan" >etiquette <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in Japan. When you meet someone, you say**<em>Konnichiwa</em>** and you bow as a sign of respect. If you receive a bow, you immediately bow back. A simple but powerful gesture that perfectly embodies the beauty of the Japanese culture.</p><p> So here are the main things you should know about the<strong>Japanese bow:</strong></p><p> – bowing lower is a sign of respect. Thus, you should always bow lower to people you don’t know or to people in a position of authority;</p><p>– 15-degree bows are for people that you are familiar with;</p><p> – 30-degree bows are for people you just met or are of a higher social status than you;</p><p> – 45-degree bows are used for greetings only if you meet a very important person like the Emperor or the Prime Minister.</p><h2 id="Bonus-basic-conversation-in-Japanese"><a href="#Bonus-basic-conversation-in-Japanese" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: basic conversation in Japanese"></a>Bonus: basic conversation in Japanese</h2><p> If you don’t want to stop at just<strong>“thank you” or “hello” in Japanese,</strong> here are a few more<strong>Japanese phrases</strong> that are fairly easy to remember and will definitely make all the difference for your trip to Japan:</p><ul><li>Hello!

Fluency is required to kick-start a conversation and it takes years of practice to achieve it. Myths like these prevent people from even trying to learn a new language. And, as many have seen before, these myths are nothing more than just… myths.</p><p> Here are the most common myths and the way in which reality comes to the rescue:</p><h2 id="1-Not-everyone-can-learn-a-foreign-language"><a href="#1-Not-everyone-can-learn-a-foreign-language" class="headerlink" title="1. Not everyone can learn a foreign language"></a>1. Not everyone can learn a foreign language</h2><p> False! Everyone with the right motivation can learn a foreign language. The amount of effort and time invested is different for experienced learners and beginners, but the fact remains that anyone can do it. Once you ‘learn how to learn’, certain patterns become visible, especially with grammar, and this makes learning much faster.</p><h2 id="2-Language-learning-requires-a-high-IQ"><a href="#2-Language-learning-requires-a-high-IQ" class="headerlink" title="2. Language learning requires a high IQ"></a>2. Language learning requires a high IQ</h2><p> So untrue! There are so many smart people who only speak one language. This is because a high IQ doesn’t make anyone a natural-born <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >polyglot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . An average IQ combined with persuasiveness, sensitivity and lots of practice is a much better recipe for becoming fluent in another language.</p><h2 id="3-Failing-to-learn-a-language-in-school-makes-the-student-incompetent"><a href="#3-Failing-to-learn-a-language-in-school-makes-the-student-incompetent" class="headerlink" title="3. Failing to learn a language in school makes the student incompetent"></a>3. Failing to learn a language in school makes the student incompetent</h2><p> There are so many stories of students who left school thinking that they were incapable of learning French or Spanish, and later in life, they became fluent within a few months of living in Latin countries. The reason why students fail to learn a language in school is mostly due to the professor’s incompetence.</p><h2 id="4-Grammar-is-difficult"><a href="#4-Grammar-is-difficult" class="headerlink" title="4. Grammar is difficult"></a>4. Grammar is difficult</h2><p> Here’s a fun fact: grammar is a language’s least difficult element and it takes the least time to master. Every language, no matter how remote, is built on clear grammar rules and the experienced learner can easily figure out patterns that he or she can use to accelerate the learning process.</p><h2 id="5-Conversations-require-fluency"><a href="#5-Conversations-require-fluency" class="headerlink" title="5. Conversations require fluency"></a>5. Conversations require fluency</h2><p> When it comes to mastering a foreign language, fluency means knowing around 5000 words. That’s a lot, considering that it takes quite some time to build such a vocabulary. Here’s the good news – having a conversation with someone from another country requires only a basic command of the language, which is around 1500 words. And here’s the even better news – very basic needs such as courtesy and traveling require an even smaller set of words and phrases, and anyone can learn these on a flight to a foreign country.</p><p> There are many such myths that make language learning seem either difficult or impossible. We at Mondly believe that there’s nothing too difficult or impossible about it. To illustrate this with an example, here’s a story from one of our users:</p><blockquote><p><em>I have always found languages very difficult and therefore not any good at learning them. At 82 years old I know [Mondly] it’s going to be very helpful when I spend time in Spain this and next year.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Criptografando-Um-Conhecimento-Em-Portugues-Greves-Gerais"><a href="#Criptografando-Um-Conhecimento-Em-Portugues-Greves-Gerais" class="headerlink" title="Criptografando Um Conhecimento Em Português - Greves Gerais"></a>Criptografando Um Conhecimento Em Português - Greves Gerais</h2><p> People are the soul of a country. You can’t really say you explored a country until you speak to its people. For example, if you travel to a Portuguese-speaking country, you don’t even need to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >speak fluent Portuguese <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Just some basic words and phrases like <strong><em>Olá!</em> (“hello” in Portuguese)</strong> , <strong><em>Obrigado</em> &#x2F;<em>Obrigada</em> (“thank you” in Portuguese)</strong> , <strong><em>Bom Dia!</em> (“good morning”)</strong> or <strong><em>Como vai?</em> (“how are you?”)</strong> are enough to spark conversations with fluent speakers. Nobody will judge you if you don’t speak Portuguese to perfection. On the contrary! They will appreciate your effort.</p><p> So next time you go on an adventure to one of the 7 countries where Portuguese is the only official language (Portugal, Brazil, Mozambique, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe), try the following<strong>Portuguese greetings</strong> and see how easy it is to connect with someone even if you don’t speak the same language.</p><h2 id="1-How-to-say-“hello”-in-Portuguese"><a href="#1-How-to-say-“hello”-in-Portuguese" class="headerlink" title="1. How to say “hello” in Portuguese"></a>1. How to say “hello” in Portuguese</h2><p> “Hello” is a <a class="link"   href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/the-origin-of-hello" >powerful word <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It opens doors. It makes people smile. And said the right way and at the right time, “hello” can impact someone’s day and you wouldn’t even know it. So here are the right ways to say “hello” in Portuguese and open doors everywhere you go.</p><h3 id="“Hello”-in-Portuguese-–-Ola"><a href="#“Hello”-in-Portuguese-–-Ola" class="headerlink" title="“Hello” in Portuguese – Olá"></a>“Hello” in Portuguese – Olá</h3><p><em>Olá</em> is the best choice for most social situations regardless of the person you are addressing. It’s somehow formal, but also friendly.</p><p> Be careful with your Portuguese pronunciation though! A lot of people accidentally mistake Portuguese for Spanish. You don’t want to do that. Just say “OH-lah” and everybody from Brazil to Mozambique will understand that you are saying “hello” in Portuguese.</p><h3 id="“Hi”-in-Portuguese-–-Oi"><a href="#“Hi”-in-Portuguese-–-Oi" class="headerlink" title="“Hi” in Portuguese – Oi"></a>“Hi” in Portuguese – Oi</h3><p> Friendly and very informal,<em>Oi!</em> is one of the most common ways to greet your friends in Brazil (people from Portugal use it as well, but not as much as_olá)_ . This is how you could greet your mates and close colleagues, but never the people you don’t really know. Don’t stress it tough! When the time comes, you will feel and just know what’s the required Portuguese greeting for that particular situation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hi-in-portuguese-1024x658.jpg"                      alt="hi in portuguese" title="Hello In Portuguese And Other Basic Portuguese Greetings You Need To Know 2"                ></p><p> “Lisbon, Portugal” by Diego García©</p><h3 id="“How-are-you”-in-Portuguese-–-Tudo-bem"><a href="#“How-are-you”-in-Portuguese-–-Tudo-bem" class="headerlink" title="“How are you” in Portuguese – Tudo bem?"></a>“How are you” in Portuguese – Tudo bem?</h3><p> Asking someone how they are doing is probably just as important as saying “hello”. Sometimes you don’t even expect an answer. This is just an even nicer way to greet someone. So let’s see the many ways Portuguese-speaking people ask someone how they are doing depending on the context.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Tudo bem?</em> – How are you?</strong> – suitable for both formal and informal situations. Literally translates to “everything well?”.</li><li><strong><em>Como está? &#x2F;</em> <em>Como vai?</em> – How are you? &#x2F; How do you do?</strong> <em>–</em> usually added immediately after the greeting, these are the right ways to address someone in a formal situation.</li><li><strong><em>Como estás? &#x2F; Como vais?</em> – How are you? &#x2F; How are you doing?</strong> – these are informal versions of the above mentioned “how are you”. They are mainly used in Portugal.</li><li><strong><em>Tem passado bem?</em>  – Have you been well?</strong> – perfect for formal situations. Literally translates to “have you been well?”.</li><li><strong><em>E aí?</em> – What’s up?</strong>  – rather than accompany <em>Oi</em> or <em>Olá</em> , <em>E aí</em>  is used as an informal substitute mainly in Brazil. In Portugal, young people will greet you saying “como é que é?” (“how is it?”).</li><li><strong><em>Como vão as coisas?</em> – How’s everything?</strong> – informal and suitable for casual use with your friends or equals. Literally translates to “how are things?”.</li><li><strong><em>Como você está? &#x2F; Como vai você?</em> – How are you? &#x2F; How are you doing?</strong> – although you can come across “você” in European Portuguese in extremely formal situations, this pronoun is the signature of Brazil where it translates to “you”. Thus, these phrases are informal and suitable to be used with friends, close colleagues and family.</li><li><strong><em>Beleza?</em> – What’s up?</strong> – universally informal and perfect for greeting close friends. It literally translates to “what’s going on with your life?”</li><li><strong><em>Quanto tempo!</em> – Long time no see!</strong> – Used the same as in English.</li><li><strong><em>Como foi o seu dia?</em> – How’s your day?</strong> – Used the same as in English.</li></ul><h2 id="2-“Bom-dia-”-and-other-Portuguese-greetings-for-certain-moments-of-the-day"><a href="#2-“Bom-dia-”-and-other-Portuguese-greetings-for-certain-moments-of-the-day" class="headerlink" title="2. “Bom dia!” and other Portuguese greetings for certain moments of the day"></a>2. “Bom dia!” and other Portuguese greetings for certain moments of the day</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/good-morning-in-portuguese-1024x642.jpg"                      alt="good morning in portuguese" title="Hello In Portuguese And Other Basic Portuguese Greetings You Need To Know 3"                ></p><p> “Rio de Janeiro, Brazil” by Raphael Nogueira©</p><p> <strong>Good morning in Portuguese –<em>Bom dia!</em></strong>  – literally meaning “good day”, this greeting is widely used between approximately 5:30 am and 12:00 – 1:00 pm. If you are in Brazil, you should say “bom GEE-a” and if you are in Portugal, you should sound like this: “bom DEE-a”.</p><p> <strong>Good afternoon in Portuguese –<em>Boa tarde!</em></strong>  – Used between lunchtime and sunset,<em>boa tarde</em> in pronounced “boa TAHR-g,” in Brazilian Portuguese and “boa TAHR-d.” in European Portuguese.</p><p> <strong>Good night in Portuguese –<em>Boa noite!</em></strong>  – The Portuguese language does not make any difference between evening and night. Thus, “goodnight” and “good evening” have the same translation in Portuguese. While in Brazil you will say “boa NOEE-tsh”, in Portugal you will say “boa NOEE-t”.</p><p> All three of these are safe to use in any kind of interaction (formal or informal).</p><h2 id="3-“Goodbye”-in-Portuguese-–-Adeus"><a href="#3-“Goodbye”-in-Portuguese-–-Adeus" class="headerlink" title="3.“Goodbye” in Portuguese – Adeus"></a>3.“Goodbye” in Portuguese – Adeus</h2><p> The most common way to say “Goodbye” in Portuguese is_Adeus_ , but you can also use_Tchau_ which simply translates to “bye”.</p><p> The same as “hello”,<em>Adeus</em> can be used safely in all kinds of situations (formal or informal), but with_Tchau_ you should be careful as it should not be used in formal situations like meetings or job interviews.</p><p> If you want to add a “see you later” to your “goodbye” in Portuguese, you can say_até mais tarde._</p><p> Or, if you want to say to someone that you’ll see them soon, in Portuguese you say_até mais, até logo_ or_até breve._</p><p> Another useful phrase for bidding farewell is “have a good day”. In Portuguese, that’s_t_ <em>enha um bom dia</em> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/portuguese-greetings-1024x682.jpg"                      alt="portuguese greetings" title="Hello In Portuguese And Other Basic Portuguese Greetings You Need To Know 4"                ></p><p> “Ruínas da Fortaleza de Arrifana, Aljezur, Portugal” by Ferhat Deniz Fors©</p><h2 id="Bonus-other-basic-Portuguese-phrases-that-you-should-know"><a href="#Bonus-other-basic-Portuguese-phrases-that-you-should-know" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: other basic Portuguese phrases that you should know"></a>Bonus: other basic Portuguese phrases that you should know</h2><p> Now that you know how to greet in Portuguese, shouldn’t you also master basic words like “yes”, “no” or “thank you” in Portuguese? Let’s kill two birds with one stone and see how a basic conversation in Portuguese should sound like:</p><ul><li>Hello! –<em>Olá!</em></li><li>How are you? –<em>Como está?</em></li><li>Very good. Thank you –<em>Bem, obrigado. E você?</em> (or_tu_ for European Portuguese)</li><li>Everything is fine. –<em>Está tudo bom.</em></li><li>What is your name? –<em>Qual é o seu nome?</em></li><li>My name is Mondly. –<em>Meu nome é Mondly.</em></li><li>Nice to meet you. –<em>Muito prazer.</em></li><li>Where are you from? –<em>De onde você é?</em></li><li>I am from _____. –<em>Sou de _____.</em></li><li>Please. –<em>Por favor.</em></li><li>Thank you. – <em>Obrigado (for men) and Obrigada (for women)</em></li><li>You’re welcome. – <em>De nada.</em></li><li>I’m sorry. –<em>Desculpe.</em></li><li>Excuse me. –<em>Com licença.</em></li><li>No problem. –<em>Não há problema.</em></li><li>Yes. –<em>Sim.</em></li><li>No. –<em>Não.</em></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/obrigado-1024x682.jpg"                      alt="obrigado" title="Hello In Portuguese And Other Basic Portuguese Greetings You Need To Know 5"                ></p><p> “Gruta do Lago Azul, Brazil” by Ademir Alves©</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/hello-in-portuguese-basic-portuguese-greetings-you-need/&t=Hello+in+Portuguese+and+Other+Basic+Portuguese+Greetings+You+Need+to+Know"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="Here’s-how-to-speak-Portuguese-in-10-minutes-a-day"><a href="#Here’s-how-to-speak-Portuguese-in-10-minutes-a-day" class="headerlink" title="Here’s how to speak Portuguese in 10 minutes a day"></a>Here’s how to speak Portuguese in 10 minutes a day</h3><p> Do you want to practice what you’ve learned and maybe learn some more Portuguese? <strong>Check Mondly, the revolutionary language learning platform that makes language learning fun, fast and easy!</strong></p><p> Mondly is a pocket-held language tutor that allows you to put your brain on autopilot and enjoy the ride to fluency in 33 languages.

Whether you are at the doctor’s office, in a clothing store, or scuba diving in Mexico, various parts of the body can come up in conversation more often than you think.</p><p> Does your head hurt and you need a pill? Do you need to disinfect your hands? Do you have to tell someone they have beautiful eyes? Let’s learn the names of the body parts in Spanish so you can say all that and even more!</p><h2 id="The-main-parts-of-the-body-in-Spanish"><a href="#The-main-parts-of-the-body-in-Spanish" class="headerlink" title="The main parts of the body in Spanish"></a>The main parts of the body in Spanish</h2><p> The main or the general parts of the body are the ones you’ll probably use the most in your daily conversations. That’s why we are going to focus on these high-frequency, high-value words first and then move to the other body parts.</p><p> The first thing you ought to know is that ‘the body’ is called_‘el cuerpo’_ in Spanish and ‘the human body’ is_‘el cuerpo humano’_ . Furthermore, ‘the parts of the body’ are_‘las partes del cuerpo’_ and ‘the skeleton’ is_‘el esqueleto’_ .</p><p><strong>The most commonly used words for body parts in Spanish are:</strong></p><ul><li>(the) head —_(la) cabeza_</li><li>(the) hair —_(el) pelo_</li><li>(the) neck —_(el) cuello_</li><li>(the) chest —_(el) pecho_</li><li>(the) arm —_(el) brazo_</li><li>(the) finger —_(el) dedo_</li><li>(the) foot —_(el) pie_</li><li>(the) face —_(la) cara_</li><li>(the) eye —_(el) ojo_</li><li>(the) hand —_(la) mano_</li><li>(the) nose —_(la) nariz_</li><li>(the) mouth —_(la) boca_</li><li>(the) leg —_(la) pierna_</li><li>(the) knee —_(la) rodilla_</li></ul><p> Are you all ears?

For example, did you know that ‘brain’ in Spanish is ‘cerebro’? If you are an X-men fan and know that ‘cerebro’ is also the name of a machine used by Professor X to amplify his telepathic ability, this one won’t be too difficult to remember.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cow-head-960x640.jpg"                      alt="cow head" title="The Body Parts In Spanish – From Head To Toe 4"                ></p><p> ‘Hi there’ by Jan Koetsier©</p><p> Considering the number of square centimeters available, the head area is probably the most “crowded” area on the human body.

Some will argue that_el cerebro_ (‘the brain’) is more important, but the heart (‘el corazón’) is the one pumping blood all over the body. By the way, did you know that every day your heart beats about 115,000 times and pumps about 6,000-7,500 liters (1,500-2,000 gallons) of blood? To better take care of it, make sure you laugh a lot. Laughing reduces stress, boosts your immune system, and makes your heart stronger.</p><p> But let’s not get cold feet and discover what are the Spanish names of the body parts located between neck and torso.</p><ul><li>(the) neck — <em>(el) cuello</em></li><li>(the) organs — <em>(los) órganos</em></li><li>(the) heart — <em>(el) corazón</em></li><li>(the) stomach — <em>(el) estómago</em>  (or <em>‘el vientre’</em>  if you are referring to the abdomen)</li><li>(the) lungs — <em>(los) pulmones</em></li><li>(the) liver — <em>(el) hígado</em></li><li>(the) kidneys — <em>(los) riñones</em></li><li>(the) intestines — <em>(los) intestinos</em></li><li>(the) skin — <em>(la) piel</em></li><li>(the) muscle — <em>(el)</em> <em>músculo</em></li><li>(the) bone — <em>(el) hueso</em></li><li>(the) spine — <em>(la) espina</em></li><li>(the) backbone — <em>(la) columna vertebral</em></li><li>(the) back — <em>(la) espalda</em></li><li>(the) shoulder — <em>(el) hombro</em></li><li>(the) arm — <em>(el) brazo</em></li><li>(the) forearm —_(el) antebrazo_</li><li>(the) elbow — <em>(el) codo</em></li><li>(the) wrist —_(la) muñeca_</li><li>(the) hand — <em>(la) mano</em></li><li>(the) palm — <em>(la) palma</em></li><li>(the) finger — <em>(el) dedo</em></li><li>(the) thumb — <em>(el) pulgar</em></li><li>(the) fingernails — <em>(las) uñas</em></li><li>(the) chest — <em>(el) pecho</em></li><li>(the) breast —_(el) seno_</li><li>(the) ribs — <em>(las) costillas</em></li><li>(the) waist — <em>(la) cintura</em></li><li>(the) navel — <em>(el) ombligo</em></li><li>(the) hip — <em>(la) cadera</em></li><li>(the) torso — <em>(el) torso</em></li></ul><h2 id="Body-parts-in-Spanish-legs-and-feet"><a href="#Body-parts-in-Spanish-legs-and-feet" class="headerlink" title="Body parts in Spanish: legs and feet"></a>Body parts in Spanish: legs and feet</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/legs-960x718.jpg"                      alt="legs" title="The Body Parts In Spanish – From Head To Toe 5"                ></p><p> ‘Underwater legs’ by Amy Humphries©</p><p> We promised that we are going to give you the Spanish names of all the body parts from head to toe, didn’t we?

You just have to remember that, in Spanish, names of parts of the body are more likely to be accompanied by the definite articles_el, la, los_ and_las_ (meaning ‘the’) instead of the usual English possessive adjectives like ‘my’, ‘your’, ‘our’ or ‘their’.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><em>Me duele <strong>el</strong> pie.</em> (‘<strong>My</strong> foot hurts.’)</li><li><em>Protéjase <strong>las</strong> manos con guantes.</em> (‘Protect <strong>your</strong> hands with gloves.’)</li></ul><p> However, Spanish doesn’t shy away from using possessive adjectives when things need to be clear.</p><ul><li><em><strong>Sus</strong> brazos son atléticos.</em> (‘<strong>His</strong> arms are athletic.’)</li><li><em>Sal de <strong>tu</strong> pecho.</em> (‘Get it off <strong>your</strong> chest.’)</li></ul><p> Additionally, there are situations when Spanish uses the definite article, but English drops even the possessive adjective.</p><ul><li><p><em>Tengo <strong>los</strong> ojos azules.</em> (I have blue eyes.)</p></li><li><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/body-parts-in-spanish/&t=The+Body+Parts+in+Spanish+%E2%80%93+From+Head+to+Toe"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></li><li><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></li></ul><hr><h3 id="From-0-to-conversational-in-Spanish"><a href="#From-0-to-conversational-in-Spanish" class="headerlink" title="From 0 to conversational in Spanish"></a>From 0 to conversational in Spanish</h3><p> The right <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Spanish words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are always on the tip of your tongue?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Croatian-Communicative-Language"><a href="#Croatian-Communicative-Language" class="headerlink" title="Croatian Communicative Language"></a>Croatian Communicative Language</h2><p> It’s true, most Croatians do speak English very well, but only as a second language. So what language is spoken in Croatia? Well, the answer is easier than you think. <strong>The name of the language Croatians speak is ‘Croatian’, the ‘Croatian language’ or_Hrvatski_ (as the natives call it).</strong></p><p> Home to beautiful lakes, magic cities, and unbroken forests, Croatia was an underrated travel destination before Game of Thrones. As you may know, a lot of scenes in Game of Thrones were filmed there, the most prominent location being Dubrovnik as King’s Landing. Over time, the notoriety of the entire country grew together with the show. So what is there to know about the language of such a beautiful country? Is it hard to learn <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Croatian <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ? How do you say ‘hello’ in Croatian if you do decide to travel there? Read on to find out.</p><h2 id="The-Croatian-language-in-a-nutshell"><a href="#The-Croatian-language-in-a-nutshell" class="headerlink" title="The Croatian language in a nutshell"></a>The Croatian language in a nutshell</h2><p> Spoken by approximately <a class="link"   href="https://www.ethnologue.com/language/hrv" >6.7 million people <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Serbian province of Vojvodina, and other neighboring countries, Croatian is a South Slavic language of the Indo-European family. Also known as_Hrvatski_ by the natives, it is the official language of Croatia and one of the 24 official languages of the European Union.</p><p> Old Church Slavonic, the ancestor of the Croatian language, appeared in the Balkan region sometime between the 6th and 7th centuries with the Slav migration. Eventually, between the 12th and 16th centuries, Old Slavonic evolved into two branches: East South Slavic and West South Slavic. The Slovene, Bosnian, Montenegrin, Serbian and Croatian languages we know today are all derived from the West South Slavic group.</p><p> As it happened with a lot of other languages in this geographical area, a succession of occupying powers later enriched the vocabulary of the Croatian language with some new German, Turkish and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Italian words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Standard Croatian – the language you will hear on the streets of Zagreb and Dubrovnik today – is based on Shtokavian, the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian. It is written using the Latin alphabet and characterized by the Ijekavian pronunciation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/language-in-croatia-960x734.jpg"                      alt="aerial view of Plitvice, Croatia" title="What Language Is Spoken In Croatia? 2"                ></p><p> “Plitvice, Croatia” by Mike Swigunski©</p><h3 id="How-similar-are-Croatian-and-Serbian"><a href="#How-similar-are-Croatian-and-Serbian" class="headerlink" title="How similar are Croatian and Serbian?"></a>How similar are Croatian and Serbian?</h3><p> If you know the story of Yugoslavia, then you also know about the strong connection between Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, and Montenegro. Sharing a common linguistic ancestor and being encouraged to use a joint language between 1918 and the 1990s, definitely had an impact on what we regard today as four independent languages. But then there’s also the fact that after the collapse of Yugoslavia, political developments have encouraged these ethnic groups to emphasize the differences between their languages. This is what you can call a turbulent and ofter erratic history.</p><p> On the other hand, let’s not forget that even today, some linguists regard Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin as a single, pluricentric language with four mutually intelligible standard varieties.</p><p> So the short answer is <strong>yes, there is mutual intelligibility between Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin.</strong> According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bosnian-Croatian-Montenegrin-Serbian-language/Serbo-Croatian-in-the-20th-century-and-after" >Encyclopedia Britannica <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , educated speakers from any of the countries can converse with full understanding, hindered only by a few everyday words and technical terms.</p><p> However, in truth, things differ. The clearest distinction between <a class="link"   href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Croatia/People#ref42766" >Croatian <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Serbian is the script because Croatian is written using the Latin alphabet and Serbian using the Cyrillic one. They are also different when it comes to grammar and pronunciation. In addition, due to the fact that they experienced different foreign domination throughout history, some more striking differences occur in vocabulary.</p><p> Add regional dialects and subdialects to that, and there you have it. What was previously called ‘the Serbo-Croatian language’ are today two different languages: Croatian and Serbian.</p><h2 id="It-is-hard-to-learn-Croatian"><a href="#It-is-hard-to-learn-Croatian" class="headerlink" title="It is hard to learn Croatian?"></a>It is hard to learn Croatian?</h2><p> If you’re a native English speaker, yes, Croatian may prove <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >hard to learn <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . But not harder than languages such as Japanese, Chinese or Arabic.</p><p> According to the FSI (Foreign Service Institute), Croatian is considered profoundly different from English. Therefore, a native English speaker is believed to need around 1100 hours or 44 weeks of study to achieve fluency in Croatian.</p><p> Don’t worry though. The FSI statistics didn’t take into consideration the help of modern learning aids like <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >language learning apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

The words from our<strong>list of 100 most misspelled words in English</strong> pose challenges for more people than you think. No matter if you’re an English native speaker or not, hard-to-spell words are determined to give you a headache. And if bad spelling does happen, it’s usually in very important contexts like your application letter or during a conversation with your crush – can’t decide which one is more heartbreaking. 💔 So, you can probably agree that correct spelling in written communication is crucial regardless of the context.</p><p> Whether we’re talking about fancy words or downright common ones like “license” (not “lisence”), misspellings are like Thanos: inevitable. But even Thanos was finally defeated, so you, too, can vanquish misspelled words. The first step is to acknowledge them, so let’s do it. We’ll begin with a small but condensed list of the most misspelled words ever and continue with a complete list of the top 100 commonly misspelled words in English. Ready, steady, go!</p><h2 id="Top-10-Most-Commonly-Misspelled-Words-in-English"><a href="#Top-10-Most-Commonly-Misspelled-Words-in-English" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Most Commonly Misspelled Words in English"></a>Top 10 Most Commonly Misspelled Words in English</h2><h3 id="1-Awkward-not-akward"><a href="#1-Awkward-not-akward" class="headerlink" title="1. Awkward not akward"></a>1. Awkward not akward</h3><p> This one will haunt some of us for the rest of our days because it also describes how we feel when we realize we’ve just misspelled a word.</p><h3 id="2-Believe-not-belive"><a href="#2-Believe-not-belive" class="headerlink" title="2. Believe not belive"></a>2. Believe not belive</h3><p> There’s a famous rhyme in English that says I before E, except after C. The exact same rule applies to “believe”, so it’s advisable to use this mnemonic when in doubt.</p><p>Careful, though – there are some exceptions to it.</p><h3 id="3-Embarrassed-not-embarassed"><a href="#3-Embarrassed-not-embarassed" class="headerlink" title="3. Embarrassed not embarassed"></a>3. Embarrassed not embarassed</h3><p>Also commonly misspelled as: embarrased</p><p> This is another classic case of two sets of double letters. You’ll reduce the chances of finding yourself in an embarrassing bad spelling situation if you remember this one.</p><h3 id="4-Entrepreneur-not-enterpreneur"><a href="#4-Entrepreneur-not-enterpreneur" class="headerlink" title="4. Entrepreneur not enterpreneur"></a>4. Entrepreneur not enterpreneur</h3><p>Also commonly misspelled as: entrepeneur , entreprenur , entreperneur</p><p> We honestly can’t blame whoever misspells this one. It’s not only hard to spell but also <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >hard to pronounce <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The reason? It’s a French word coming from the root entreprendre (‘undertake’).</p><h3 id="5-Liaison-not-liasion"><a href="#5-Liaison-not-liasion" class="headerlink" title="5. Liaison not liasion"></a>5. Liaison not liasion</h3><p> There’s a reason why you’re never sure how to spell “liaison”, “bureaucracy”, “manoeuvre”, “questionnaire”, and “connoisseur”. They do not follow the same patterns because they are all <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >French words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p>Your best bet is to just remember the correct spelling.</p><h3 id="6-License-not-lisence"><a href="#6-License-not-lisence" class="headerlink" title="6. License not lisence"></a>6. License not lisence</h3><p> This is a special situation. In American English, it’s always spelled “license” – no matter what. On the other hand, in British English, it’s spelled “license” when it’s a verb and “licence” when it’s a noun.</p><p> Basically, the only wrong spelling is “lisense”. However, once you decide which spelling you’re going to use – American or British – it’s best to go forward with that one don’t combine both.</p><h3 id="7-Receive-not-recieve"><a href="#7-Receive-not-recieve" class="headerlink" title="7. Receive not recieve"></a>7. Receive not recieve</h3><p> Remember the “I before E, except after C” rule? This is the kind of word where the rule applies. It also applies to “niece” and “siege”, but it doesn’t apply to “weird” or “seize”. So trust the rule, but keep in mind it has some exceptions.</p><h3 id="8-Successful-not-successfull"><a href="#8-Successful-not-successfull" class="headerlink" title="8. Successful not successfull"></a>8. Successful not successfull</h3><p>Also commonly misspelled as: succesful, sucessful</p><p> There are so many double consonants in English that it becomes tempting to double them all sometimes. But for the love of English, don’t do that to “successful”.</p><h3 id="9-Thorough-not-thourough"><a href="#9-Thorough-not-thourough" class="headerlink" title="9. Thorough not thourough"></a>9. Thorough not thourough</h3><p> You probably heard this tongue twister before: “English can be understood through tough thorough thought, though.” It’s hard not to get confused with so many similar-looking words. You add an O to “through” and its pronunciation changes completely.</p><h3 id="10-Until-not-untill"><a href="#10-Until-not-untill" class="headerlink" title="10. Until not untill"></a>10. Until not untill</h3><p> This one is somehow similar to the “successful” situation, but not entirely. As a matter of fact, “until” was spelled with two Ls in the Middle Ages. If it helps you remember, you can think it just lost some weight but getting rid of the last L (unlike “still”).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hard-words-to-spell-960x641.jpg"                      alt="&quot;Hard words to spell&quot; by Julia M Cameron©" title="Top 100 Most Misspelled Words In English 2"                ></p><h2 id="Why-Spelling-Matters"><a href="#Why-Spelling-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Why Spelling Matters"></a>Why Spelling Matters</h2><p> English has drawn inspiration from many different languages, so it’s perfectly normal to get confused because of its double consonants and silent letters. We all know that moment when you stare at a word for ages and still can’t believe it has two sets of double letters. But it’s true. There are many such examples. In fact, “misspelled” is one of them and people often misspell it.</p><p>Loading poll …</p><p>Coming Soon</p><p> What is the hardest word to spell for you?</p><p> Awkward  Awkward52 (17.16 %)</p><p> Embarrassed  Embarrassed152 (50.17 %)</p><p> License  License73 (24.09 %)</p><p> Successful  Successful26 (8.58 %)</p><p> Anyway, it’s easy to make excuses! We’ve all been there. But the truth is that spelling matters. Not only in professional settings but everywhere in life. Sometimes, your spelling is the first impression someone gets of you. What would your future employer think if you wrote “aquire” instead of “acquire” or “bizzare” instead of “bizarre” (easy with the Zs, Buzz)? Good spelling can be the difference between losing or getting that dream job.</p><p> But why is that? Why do people place such a high importance on spelling? Well, good spelling can tell a couple of things about you:</p><ul><li><strong>You pay attention to details:</strong> Employers often consider this a great asset to have in today’s world. If, unlike other candidates, you spelled Mrs. Saoirse’s name right in your letter of application, you may get an extra point for attention to detail!</li><li><strong>You’re a perfectionist:</strong> Contrary to what some people may think, being a perfectionist is not always a bad thing. If you’re a perfectionist, you won’t permit bad spelling to make you seem sloppy.</li><li><strong>You respect your readers:</strong> Regardless of how many people will read your work, good spelling shows that you value the time they take to do it.</li><li><strong>You have a strong educational background:</strong> Proficiency in spelling often indicates a good grasp of the language. It suggests that you had the opportunity to learn and practice language skills extensively.</li></ul><h2 id="Commonly-Misspelled-Words-Table-Top-100"><a href="#Commonly-Misspelled-Words-Table-Top-100"

Improving Your Spelling</h2><p> How do you avoid misspellings? One obvious answer would be spell-checkers. Alas, spell-checkers won’t actually help you to improve your spelling. You will continue to misspell words and they’ll continue to correct them like the good friends they are. This process won’t stimulate you to learn the correct spelling because somebody else already does the job for you. However, if you do want a very good spell-checker to keep you in check, we recommend Grammarly.</p><p> Supposing you really want to improve your English spelling, you’ll just have to practice. Go through this list, then add your own commonly misspelled words and practice writing them a few times. You’ll get the hang of it with just a few attempts.</p><p> If you’re only starting to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn English <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (or any other language), put your best foot forward with a language learning app such as <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-7340&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-7340&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-7340" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Not only does the app include spelling exercises, but it also gives you access to quick lesson reviews with all the words you’ve learned. The best way to avoid bad spelling is to convince your brain to remember the correct spelling from day one!</p><p>Let’s recap. To improve your spelling, you can:</p><ul><li><strong>Practice proofreading:</strong> In other words, carefully check for errors in your text before sharing or publishing it.</li><li><strong>Use spell-checkers:</strong> Grammarly is the best at keeping your written communication tidy, but we can also rely on Word’s built-in spell-checker or even ask ChatGPT or Google when you’re not sure whether your word is spelled right or not.</li><li><strong>Memorize challenging words:</strong> We all have some words we keep getting wrong. So, our recommendation would be to take a pen and a piece of paper and write them by hand a few times until they stick. It’s traditional but it works.</li></ul><h2 id="Why-Some-Words-Are-Tricky"><a href="#Why-Some-Words-Are-Tricky" class="headerlink" title="Why Some Words Are Tricky"></a>Why Some Words Are Tricky</h2><p> When it comes to spelling, the English language is a real maverick. No wonder there are spelling bee competitions organized for young English-speaking students.</p><p>English words can be tricky to spell for several reasons:</p><ol><li><strong>Silent letters:</strong> These are not pronounced, but they are included in the spelling, which makes the job even harder. Thank you, English!</li><li><strong>Double consonants:</strong> There are so many of them in English, that it’s tempting to use them even when you’re not supposed to.</li><li><strong>Homophones:</strong> Words that sound the same but are spelled differently? A nightmare for spelling. Is it “their,” “there,” or “they’re”? It can be hard to tell.</li><li><strong>Exceptions to rules:</strong> Remember “I before E, except after C”? Well, that’s not true for “weird”, “height” and many others.</li><li><strong>Phonetic inconsistencies:</strong> To top it all off, the same sound can be spelled in different ways in different words (like the “oo” sound in “boot” and “blood”), and the same spelling can represent different sounds (like the “ough” in “through,” “though,” “tough,” and “thought”).</li></ol><p> Still, no matter how tricky, we love the English language because it brings everyone together. At this point in time, it wouldn’t be wrong to call it the_lingua franca_ of the world. A_lingua franca_ is a language used for communication between people who do not share a native language.

In American English, “misspelled” is the standard past tense and past participle form. However, “misspelt” is commonly used in British English, although “misspelled” is also acceptable.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/commonly-misspelled-words-english/&t=Top+100+Most+Misspelled+Words+in+English"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h4 id="Improve-your-English-fast"><a href="#Improve-your-English-fast" class="headerlink" title="Improve your English fast"></a>Improve your English fast</h4><p> Do you want to get better at speaking and writing English fast?
