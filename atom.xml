    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="All-African-Languages-A-Complete-Guide-To-The-Continent’s-Linguistic-Diversity"><a href="#All-African-Languages-A-Complete-Guide-To-The-Continent’s-Linguistic-Diversity" class="headerlink" title="All African Languages: A Complete Guide To The Continent’s Linguistic Diversity"></a>All African Languages: A Complete Guide To The Continent’s Linguistic Diversity</h2><p> Africa’s total number of native languages can prove hard to count as the continent is the second-largest and second-most populous in the world after Asia. Naturally, the number of<strong>African languages</strong> is proportionately mirrored in the vastness of this captivating blend of diverse cultures, historical richness, and stunning landscapes. Linguists now agree that<strong>Africa is home to 2,000 distinct languages,</strong> representing nearly a third of the world’s languages – a linguistic tapestry like no other on Earth!</p><p> Whether you’re honoring Africa Day on May 25 or you’re simply interested in exploring the many languages of Africa, you’re in the right place. We’re about to delve into the fascinating kaleidoscope of African languages, shedding light on the most commonly spoken tongues across the continent and the less-known, equally intriguing indigenous languages.</p><h2 id="African-language-families"><a href="#African-language-families" class="headerlink" title="African language families"></a>African language families</h2><p> African languages are as fascinating as they are diverse. For example, certain languages within the Khoisan family distinctly stand out on the global language map due to their characteristic ‘click’ sounds – a rather exceptional phonetic feature that is largely unheard of outside this region.</p><p> But that’s not everything. There are still many more fascinating facts to uncover about the African languages. For starters, it’s good to know that they fall under several major<strong>language families:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Niger-Congo:</strong> A hypothetical language family which includes the Atlantic-Congo and Mande languages in West, Central, Southeast and Southern Africa. If considered valid, the Niger-Congo language family would be the largest in the world.</li><li><strong>Afroasiatic languages:</strong> Spoken in Asia, but also in North Africa, the Horn of Africa and parts of the Sahel. The Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, Egyptian and Omotic branches are all native exclusively to the African continent.</li><li><strong>Nilo-Saharan languages:</strong> Include the Saharan, Nilotic and Sudanic languages spoken in the northern half of Africa. Keep in mind that this is only a proposed language family.</li><li><strong>Austronesian languages:</strong> Spoken in Madagascar, Comoros and other countries outside the African continent, this is the fifth-largest language family by number of speakers.</li><li><strong>Khoe–Kwadi languages:</strong> Native primarily to Botswana and Namibia.</li><li><strong>Indo-European languages:</strong> Colonialism resulted in the spread of Indo-European languages even to Africa, so you’ll hear many of them spoken here. For instance, you’ll hear Afrikaans, English, and German in South Africa and Namibia. English is also commonly spoken in Liberia and countries that were once British colonies. The same is true for French, Portuguese and Spanish, which are all spoken in their respective former colonies.</li></ul><p> These are just a part of the African language families. There are also several other smaller language groups (such as Khoisan, Mande and Ubangian) and language isolates, along with mixed languages known as creoles and others that haven’t been categorized yet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/south-african-languages-960x639.jpg"                      alt="&#39;South African languages&#39; by Harshil Gudka©" title="Welcome To The Wonderful World Of African Languages 2"                ></p><h2 id="List-of-African-Languages"><a href="#List-of-African-Languages" class="headerlink" title="List of African Languages"></a>List of African Languages</h2><p> Unsurprisingly, multilingualism is quite common in Africa. In many African countries, people may speak a local language at home, another at school or work and even French, Portuguese, English, or Arabic for formal education or communication with the government.</p><p> As previously mentioned, Africa is home to 2,000 languages so attempting to list all African languages would be an enormous task. However, we can look at some of the most notable languages from different regions in Africa:</p><h2 id="List-of-African-languages"><a href="#List-of-African-languages" class="headerlink" title="List of African languages"></a>List of African languages</h2><p> Search:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Language</th><th>Countries spoken in</th><th>Estimated number of speakers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Afar</strong></td><td>Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia</td><td>1.5 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Afrikans</strong></td><td>South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe</td><td>7.2 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Akan</strong></td><td>Ghana</td><td>11 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Amharic</strong></td><td>Ethiopia</td><td>32 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Arabic</strong></td><td>Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, Western Sahara</td><td>Over 100 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bambara</strong></td><td>Mali</td><td>6 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Berber</strong></td><td>Algeria, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, Western Sahara</td><td>16 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bono</strong></td><td>Ghana</td><td>1.3 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chichewa</strong></td><td>Malawi, Zambia</td><td>10 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dinka</strong></td><td>South Sudan</td><td>2 million</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Showing 1 to 10 of 39 entries</p><p> Previous  Next</p><p> We listed only some of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >most spoken African languages <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with over 1 million speakers here, but the list can go on. Let’s not forget that there are many African languages that are unfortunately at risk of extinction. However, increased efforts to preserve them through formal education, literature, and technology exist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/themes/mondly/img/mondly-banner-icon.png"                      alt="mondly banner icon" title="Welcome To The Wonderful World Of African Languages 3"                ></p><h5 id="Language-learning-made-easy"><a href="#Language-learning-made-easy" class="headerlink" title="Language learning made easy"></a>Language learning made easy</h5><p> Build practical language skills for real life with Mondly.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-8171&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-8171&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-8171&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-8171&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-8171&mt=8" >Start Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Top-African-languages-by-geographical-region"><a href="#Top-African-languages-by-geographical-region" class="headerlink" title="Top African languages by geographical region"></a>Top African languages by geographical region</h2><p> Now let’s put things into perspective by looking at the African languages from a different point of view.</p><h3 id="North-African-languages"><a href="#North-African-languages" class="headerlink" title="North African languages"></a>North African languages</h3><p> North Africa is largely dominated by Arabic, with different dialects spoken across countries like Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco. Additionally, the region resonates with the echoes of Berber, a time-honored language with diverse variants, particularly flourishing in Morocco and Algeria.</p><p> French is another common language here, reflecting the region’s colonial history.</p><h3 id="South-African-languages"><a href="#South-African-languages" class="headerlink" title="South African languages"></a>South African languages</h3><p> In Southern Africa, the many languages that coexist reflect the region’s rich culture and history. English, a remnant of the colonial era, is widely spoken and serves as an official language in many countries of this region. However, indigenous languages like Zulu and Xhosa hold a central position, especially in South Africa. Afrikaans, a language rooted in Dutch, also has many speakers here, particularly in South Africa and Namibia.</p><h3 id="West-African-languages"><a href="#West-African-languages" class="headerlink" title="West African languages"></a>West African languages</h3><p> West Africa is a linguistic hotspot boasting hundreds of languages in the 16 countries that make up this region. Prominent languages include Hausa, widely spoken in Nigeria, Niger, Ghana and Cameroon; Yoruba and Igbo, both prevalent in Nigeria; and Akan, commonly spoken in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire.</p><h3 id="East-African-languages"><a href="#East-African-languages" class="headerlink" title="East African languages"></a>East African languages</h3><p> Just as linguistically diverse, Eastern Africa is often associated with Swahili, a language that is widely spoken along the coast and inland. English also plays a significant role here as it is an official language in countries such as Kenya and Uganda.</p><p> Indigenous languages like Amharic and Oromo add to the vibrant linguistic panorama in this region.</p><h2 id="Most-spoken-African-languages-discover-the-top-languages-across-the-continent"><a href="#Most-spoken-African-languages-discover-the-top-languages-across-the-continent" class="headerlink" title="Most spoken African languages: discover the top languages across the continent"></a>Most spoken African languages: discover the top languages across the continent</h2><p> With over 2,000 distinct languages, Africa is nothing short of linguistic diversity. However, some languages dominate the African scene.<strong>The 10 most spoken languages in Africa are:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Arabic</strong> – 150 million speakers</li><li><strong>Swahili</strong> – 50 million speakers</li><li><strong>Hausa</strong> – 49 million speakers</li><li><strong>Oromo</strong> – 37 million speakers</li><li><strong>Amharic</strong> – 32.4 million speakers</li><li><strong>Yoruba</strong> – 28 million speakers</li><li><strong>Igbo</strong> – 27 million speakers</li><li><strong>Fula</strong> – 25 million speakers</li><li><strong>Malagasy</strong> – 18 million speakers</li><li><strong>Portuguese</strong> – 17 million speakers</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/african-languages-list-960x642.jpg"                      alt="&#39;African languages list&#39; by Sergey Pesterev©" title="Welcome To The Wonderful World Of African Languages 4"                ></p><h2 id="Official-languages-in-the-Central-African-Republic-and-South-Africa"><a href="#Official-languages-in-the-Central-African-Republic-and-South-Africa" class="headerlink" title="Official languages in the Central African Republic and South Africa"></a>Official languages in the Central African Republic and South Africa</h2><p> In the heart of Africa, <strong>the official languages of the Central African Republic are Sango and French.</strong> While French is a relic of the colonial era, Sango is an indigenous language that acts as a lingua franca. Sango’s origin is highly debated as some experts consider it Ngbandi-based creole, while others argue that the changes in Sango structures can be explained without a creolization process.</p><p> Much further south, in Africa’s most prominent country, we find a pluralistic makeup that is reflected in the constitution’s recognition of 11 official languages, the fourth-highest number of official languages for a country in the world.</p><p> The<strong>official languages of South Africa</strong> are Zulu, Xhosa, Afrikaans, English, Sepedi, Swazi, Sesotho, Setswana, Xitsonga, Tshivenda, and Ndebele.</p><h2 id="Ancient-African-languages-tracing-the-origins-of-African-languages"><a href="#Ancient-African-languages-tracing-the-origins-of-African-languages" class="headerlink" title="Ancient African languages: tracing the origins of African languages"></a>Ancient African languages: tracing the origins of African languages</h2><p> African languages often reflect the rich cultural heritage and traditions of the continent. That’s one of the reasons why it’s so fascinating to learn about the languages spoken in Africa. Idioms, proverbs, riddles and oral history are all integral parts of many African languages and cultures.</p><p> However, no language reflects the history of the African continent like the ancient African languages do. For instance, Berber, spoken in North Africa, is believed to be one of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >oldest languages in the world <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , dating back thousands of years – though the found evidence is not convincing enough yet.</p><p> In the same vein, Ge’ez, an ancient language of Ethiopia, remains in use today as the liturgical language of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Sometimes referred to in scholarly literature as Classical Ethiopic, Ge’ez became extinct sometime between the 10th and 14th centuries.</p><p> Other<strong>ancient languages of Africa are Egyptian and Khoisan.</strong> As previously mentioned, the Khoisan languages are defined as those languages that have click consonants. As you can imagine, they sound unlike any other language you’ve ever heard.</p><p> Most Khoisan languages are in danger of disappearing, and some are already dying out or extinct. Unfortunately, many of these languages also lack written documentation, so it’s hard to work on their preservation. The most widely spoken Khoisan languages are Khoekhoe and Sandawe.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/Lp71UWmAAeJHi/giphy.gif"                      alt="African languages" title="Welcome To The Wonderful World Of African Languages 5"                ></p><p> As we celebrate Africa Day, let’s appreciate the rich tapestry of African languages contributing to the world’s cultural heritage. While they may differ, they all share one fundamental goal – to facilitate communication and foster mutual understanding among people, reflecting the spirit of Ubuntu, an African philosophy signifying the interconnectedness of humanity.</p><p>Let’s recap some of the things we learned about the languages of Africa.</p><h3 id="How-many-African-languages-are-there"><a href="#How-many-African-languages-are-there" class="headerlink" title="How many African languages are there?"></a>How many African languages are there?</h3><p> According to experts, there are over 2,000 African languages in the world.</p><h3 id="What-percentage-of-all-world-languages-is-African"><a href="#What-percentage-of-all-world-languages-is-African" class="headerlink" title="What percentage of all world languages is African?"></a>What percentage of all world languages is African?</h3><p> African languages represent over 30% of all the languages in the world.</p><h3 id="Why-does-Africa-speak-so-many-languages"><a href="#Why-does-Africa-speak-so-many-languages" class="headerlink" title="Why does Africa speak so many languages?"></a>Why does Africa speak so many languages?</h3><p> Africa is home to so many languages because of its cast size and long history of human habitation. Add colonialism to that and you get a linguistic mosaic like no other.</p><h3 id="Are-African-languages-dying"><a href="#Are-African-languages-dying" class="headerlink" title="Are African languages dying?"></a>Are African languages dying?</h3><p> Yes, many African languages are endangered and at risk of dying out. Factors such as globalization, urbanization, migration, and the influence of dominant languages have a negative influence on endangered African languages.</p><h3 id="What-African-language-is-in-The-Lion-King"><a href="#What-African-language-is-in-The-Lion-King" class="headerlink" title="What African language is in The Lion King?"></a>What African language is in The Lion King?</h3><p> There are six indigenous African languages spoken in Disney’s ‘The Lion King’: Swahili, Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, Tswana and Congolese. Their inclusion in ‘The Lion King’ add an authentic African touch to the film’s setting and story.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/african-languages/&t=Welcome+to+the+Wonderful+World+of+African+Languages"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h4 id="Learn-Afrikaans-Arabic-and-more-with-Mondly"><a href="#Learn-Afrikaans-Arabic-and-more-with-Mondly" class="headerlink" title="Learn Afrikaans, Arabic and more with Mondly"></a>Learn Afrikaans, Arabic and more with Mondly</h4><p> Do you want to explore Africa’s vibrant linguistic mosaic?

But there are a few ways in which learning a foreign language will forever change the way you experience many aspects of life.</p><h2 id="1-English-is-not-the-most-commonly-spoken-language-in-the-world"><a href="#1-English-is-not-the-most-commonly-spoken-language-in-the-world" class="headerlink" title="1. English is not the most commonly spoken language in the world"></a>1. English is not the most commonly spoken language in the world</h2><p> Did you know that the two most commonly spoken languages in the world are Mandarin and Spanish? That’s right. Whether you’re traveling for business or for pleasure, chances are that you will find more people along the way who speak either Mandarin or Spanish than people who speak English. Learning an extra foreign language, besides English, will increase your chances of interacting with people around the world in their mother tongue.</p><h2 id="2-Stand-out-from-the-crowd"><a href="#2-Stand-out-from-the-crowd" class="headerlink" title="2. Stand out from the crowd"></a>2. Stand out from the crowd</h2><p> Today we are over 7 billion people living on planet Earth and many of us try to be special one way or another. A foreign language will definitely make you stand out from the crowd, especially if it’s less common.</p><h2 id="3-Impress-people"><a href="#3-Impress-people" class="headerlink" title="3. Impress people"></a>3. Impress people</h2><p> Imagine that you’re at a party or with a new group of people and you’ve just completed a Japanese language course. This new skill will definitely get you some positive attention from the ones around you.</p><h2 id="4-Truly-appreciate-international-literature-music-and-film"><a href="#4-Truly-appreciate-international-literature-music-and-film" class="headerlink" title="4. Truly appreciate international literature, music and film"></a>4. Truly appreciate international literature, music and film</h2><p> Imagine reading the original works of your favorite foreign author. Or watching French films without subtitles. Learning a foreign language can help you enjoy international art in its purest form, just like the artist intended it to be.</p><h2 id="5-Enhance-your-employability"><a href="#5-Enhance-your-employability" class="headerlink" title="5. Enhance your employability"></a>5. Enhance your employability</h2><p> Language skills are greatly valued in the selection process for most jobs. Nowadays companies operate across borders and continents and hiring managers expect you to speak at least one international language. Any additional language on your resume will increase your chances of landing that dream job.</p><h2 id="6-Study-abroad"><a href="#6-Study-abroad" class="headerlink" title="6. Study abroad"></a>6. Study abroad</h2><p> The world of education is rapidly evolving and every year more students are involved in international exchange programs. If you’re one of those students or if you plan to be, don’t limit your options to universities that offer courses in English. Learn a foreign language and choose the countries where the teaching language is not accessible to the rest of your colleagues. This will definitely lead to a unique experience and it will make you stand out from the crowd.</p><h2 id="7-Meet-new-people-and-develop-international-friendships"><a href="#7-Meet-new-people-and-develop-international-friendships" class="headerlink" title="7. Meet new people and develop international friendships"></a>7. Meet new people and develop international friendships</h2><p> A common language helps people connect. This can happen either during your globetrotting, over the internet or within language-related meetups. Speaking a foreign language will help you interact with more people and create life-long friendships anywhere in the world.</p><h2 id="8-Completely-transform-the-travel-experience"><a href="#8-Completely-transform-the-travel-experience" class="headerlink" title="8. Completely transform the travel experience"></a>8. Completely transform the travel experience</h2><p> Traveling should be one of the main reasons why anyone would want to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn a new language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Imagine that you’re traveling to an exotic country and you can experience not only its vivid scenery and amazing food smells, but also the conversations around you. Aside from this, speaking the local language will help you better interact with people and in some countries, you can even bargain for that overpriced souvenir or taxi ride to the airport.</p><h2 id="9-Discover-a-new-culture"><a href="#9-Discover-a-new-culture" class="headerlink" title="9. Discover a new culture"></a>9. Discover a new culture</h2><p> Learning a foreign language is so much more than just memorizing words or pronunciation. When you <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn a foreign language, you immerse yourself <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> not only in that language’s vocabulary but also in the cultures where the language is spoken. It’s a truly rich learning experience.</p><h2 id="10-Increase-global-understanding-and-create-a-brighter-future-for-everyone"><a href="#10-Increase-global-understanding-and-create-a-brighter-future-for-everyone" class="headerlink" title="10. Increase global understanding and create a brighter future for everyone"></a>10. Increase global understanding and create a brighter future for everyone</h2><p> Most inter-personal conflicts start from miscommunication or no communication. Speaking a foreign language comes with a better understanding of the cultures that speak that language and this can be a great deal when it comes to intercultural communication and resolving conflict. If we all knew how to better talk to each other, the world would definitely be a better place.</p><p> How did you benefit from <a class="link"   href="https://androidappsforme.com/mondly-languages-app-review/" >learning a foreign language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or what’s your motivation to learn one in the future?

The Star Wars universe has been fascinating Earthlings for decades with its quirky characters, captivating storylines and unique languages. The galaxy far, far away wouldn’t be the same without the growls of Wookiees or the beeps and whistles of droids. <strong>Star Wars languages add a special kind of substance and humor to the universe,</strong> making us love it even more! So let’s explore the enchanting realm of interstellar communication by looking over the languages spoken in the Star Wars universe.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/krkrHAEodHgzP72rTI/giphy.gif"                      alt="grogu" title="Languages Spoken In The Star Wars Universe 7"                ></p><p> Buckle up, grab your lightsaber and make sure the Force is strong with you. Throughout our galactic journey, we’ll make several stops:</p><p> That being said, let’s hit the road with some of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >most widely spoken <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Star Wars languages.</p><h2 id="Galactic-Basic-the-most-widely-spoken-Star-Wars-language"><a href="#Galactic-Basic-the-most-widely-spoken-Star-Wars-language" class="headerlink" title="Galactic Basic: the most widely spoken Star Wars language"></a>Galactic Basic: the most widely spoken Star Wars language</h2><p> <strong>Galactic Basic is the equivalent of <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >English <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the Star Wars Universe.</strong> Also known as <a class="link"   href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic%5FBasic%5FStandard" >Galactic Basic Standard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Galactic Standard, or just Basic, this language is the_lingua franca*_ of the galaxy.</p><p> To avoid confusion, let’s put it straight:<strong>Galatic Basic is English.</strong> The only difference is that Galactic Basic has its own writing system called Aurebesh.</p><p> Being the most widely spoken Star Wars language, it’s no surprise that humans and many other species in the galaxy speak Galactic Basic.</p><p> <em>*As you may know, a lingua franca is a language used for communication between groups of people who speak different languages</em></p><h3 id="Aurebesh-the-Star-Wars-alphabet"><a href="#Aurebesh-the-Star-Wars-alphabet" class="headerlink" title="Aurebesh: the Star Wars alphabet"></a>Aurebesh: the Star Wars alphabet</h3><p> Aurebesh is the primary writing system of the galaxy. Often seen on displays, signs and other in-universe text, Aurebesh consists of 26 letters that correspond exactly to the English alphabet. Its name is a combination of its first two letters:<em>aurek</em> and_besh_ .</p><p> Although Aurebesh first appeared in the Star Wars films, it has since gained popularity as a key component of the franchise’s extended universe. It can be found in a wide range of media, including books, comics, video games, and various merchandise items.</p><h2 id="Huttese-the-language-of-the-Hutt-Cartel-and-beyond"><a href="#Huttese-the-language-of-the-Hutt-Cartel-and-beyond" class="headerlink" title="Huttese: the language of the Hutt Cartel and beyond"></a>Huttese: the language of the Hutt Cartel and beyond</h2><p><strong>Huttese is the native tongue of the Hutts,</strong> a race of sizable, slug-like beings infamous for their control over the sprawling criminal empire known as the Hutt Cartel. The language has made appearances in numerous Star Wars films, particularly in scenes featuring the infamous crime lord Jabba the Hutt.</p><p> To create Huttese, sound designer Ben Burtt drew<strong>inspiration from Quechua,</strong> an indigenous language spoken in the Andean region of South America. Huttese is not an exact replica of Quechua, but its creation process is quite fascinating. Ben Burtt had voice actor Larry Ward listen to recordings of the actual language, enabling him to improvise an on-screen language for characters such as Jabba and Greedo.</p><p> Though not as fully developed as some other fictional languages, Huttese boasts a unique vocabulary and grammatical framework.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/themes/mondly/img/mondly-banner-icon.png"                      alt="mondly banner icon" title="Languages Spoken In The Star Wars Universe 8"                ></p><h5 id="Be-your-own-C3PO-with-Mondly"><a href="#Be-your-own-C3PO-with-Mondly" class="headerlink" title="Be your own C3PO with Mondly"></a>Be your own C3PO with Mondly</h5><p> Skip the inch-thick textbooks and learn over 40 languages fast with quick Mondly lessons.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-7642&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-7642&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-7642&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_shortcode&utm_source=blog-post-id-7642&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-7642&mt=8" >Start now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Shyriiwook-the-guttural-tongue-of-the-Wookiees"><a href="#Shyriiwook-the-guttural-tongue-of-the-Wookiees" class="headerlink" title="Shyriiwook: the guttural tongue of the Wookiees"></a>Shyriiwook: the guttural tongue of the Wookiees</h2><p><strong>Shyriiwook,</strong> also known as Wookieespeak, is<strong>the language of Chewbacca</strong> and other Wookiees. Shyriiwook is characterized by its distinctive vocalizations, which largely include growls, roars, and moans.</p><p> While individuals from other species (such as Chewie’s companion, Han Solo) can comprehend Shyriiwook, it is incredibly challenging, if not impossible, for non-Wookiees to speak the language.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/star-wars-language-960x640.jpg"                      alt="&#39;Star Wars language&#39; by Craig Adderley©" title="Languages Spoken In The Star Wars Universe 9"                ></p><p> The same as Huttese, Shyriiwook was created by sound designer Ben Burtt from walrus, camel, bear, and badger recordings from his personal sound library. A notable component of the sounds came from an American black bear residing in Happy Hollow Park &amp; Zoo in San Jose, California. By mixing these sounds in varying proportions, a range of distinct roars was created.</p><h2 id="Droidspeak-the-beeps-and-whistles-of-the-galaxy’s-mechanical-beings"><a href="#Droidspeak-the-beeps-and-whistles-of-the-galaxy’s-mechanical-beings" class="headerlink" title="Droidspeak: the beeps and whistles of the galaxy’s mechanical beings"></a>Droidspeak: the beeps and whistles of the galaxy’s mechanical beings</h2><p><strong>Droidspeak,</strong> also known as Binary or Astromech Binary, is the communication language employed by astromech droids, like the iconic R2-D2 and BB-8. Droidspeak consists of a series of electronic beeps, whistles, and other synthesized sounds that convey information and emotions. Although droidspeak is generally unintelligible to the viewing audience, it appears to be understood by characters such as Luke Skywalker.</p><p> This language is another creation of sound designer Ben Burtt who crafted R2-D2’s dialogue in the original Star Wars using an ARP 2600 analog synthesizer and processing his own voice through additional effects. In_The Force Awakens_ , BB-8’s dialogue was produced by altering the voices of Bill Hader and Ben Schwartz using a talkbox connected to a sound effects app on an iPad.</p><h2 id="Mando’a-the-mysterious-language-of-the-Mandalorian"><a href="#Mando’a-the-mysterious-language-of-the-Mandalorian" class="headerlink" title="Mando’a: the mysterious language of the Mandalorian"></a>Mando’a: the mysterious language of the Mandalorian</h2><p> Mando’a is the native language of the Mandalorian people from the planet Mandalore. The language is deeply tied to the Mandalorian culture, which is characterized by its martial traditions, unique armor, and sense of loyalty and family.</p><p> Author Karen Traviss created Mando’a for the_Star Wars Republic Commando_ book series. Since then, the language has appeared in various Star Wars media, including the animated series_Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ and the critically acclaimed live-action series_The Mandalorian_ , starring Pedro Pascal.</p><p> Mando’s language is a mainly spoken, agglutinative language without grammatical gender for nouns and pronouns. It typically uses an active voice with three grammatical tenses (present, past, and future), though speakers mostly use the present tense. As mentioned in Karen Traviss’s novels_Order 66_ and_501st_ , there is a mutually intelligible dialect called “Concordian” spoken on the planet Concord Dawn.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mandalorian-language-960x768.jpg"                      alt="&#39;Mandalorian language&#39; by Din Djarin©" title="Languages Spoken In The Star Wars Universe 10"                ></p><p> For example, the word for armor in Mando’a is_Beskar’gam._</p><h2 id="Twi’leki-The-melodic-language-also-known-as-Ryl"><a href="#Twi’leki-The-melodic-language-also-known-as-Ryl" class="headerlink" title="Twi’leki: The melodic language also known as Ryl"></a>Twi’leki: The melodic language also known as Ryl</h2><p> Twi’leki, also known as Ryl, is the language spoken by the Twi’leks, a species of humanoid creatures with distinctive head-tails called lekku. Twi’leks hail from the planet Ryloth and can be found in various roles throughout the galaxy, including politicians, criminals, and entertainers.</p><p> Essentially, Twi’leki includes both verbal sounds and precise lekku movements. The sign language used by Twi’leks enabled them to convey complete ideas without uttering a single word. For example, lifting the tip of one’s right lek signifies “Hello!”, while lowering the tip of one’s left lek indicates “Goodbye!”.</p><p> The majority of Twi’leks in the galactic community are also proficient in Basic or Huttese, but they typically use these languages when not interacting with their own species.</p><h2 id="The-extended-list-of-Star-Wars-languages"><a href="#The-extended-list-of-Star-Wars-languages" class="headerlink" title="The extended list of Star Wars languages"></a>The extended list of Star Wars languages</h2><p> The Star Wars universe has introduced us to over 70 languages so far.

However, many of the languages featured in the saga result from the collaborative efforts of writers, sound designers, and language consultants.</p><p> While languages like Huttese and Ewokese are based on real-life languages like Quechua and Kalmyk, other Star Wars languages are inspired by mere animal sounds. The creation process includes mixing and adapting the sounds until they match what the creators envisioned.</p><h3 id="Are-there-any-real-life-languages-that-inspired-the-Star-Wars-languages"><a href="#Are-there-any-real-life-languages-that-inspired-the-Star-Wars-languages" class="headerlink" title="Are there any real-life languages that inspired the Star Wars languages?"></a>Are there any real-life languages that inspired the Star Wars languages?</h3><p> Yes, real-life languages like Finnish, Quechua, Kalmyk, Haya, Xhosa, Indonesian and Tibetan all served as inspiration for different Star Wars languages.</p><p> Some of the Star Wars languages inspired by real-life languages are Huttese, Sullustese, Ewokese, and Geonosian.</p><h3 id="Can-I-learn-a-Star-Wars-language"><a href="#Can-I-learn-a-Star-Wars-language" class="headerlink" title="Can I learn a Star Wars language?"></a>Can I learn a Star Wars language?</h3><p> Yes, you can learn a Star Wars language, but the extent of your learning will depend on the language’s level of development. Some languages such as Huttese or Mando’a have more comprehensive vocabularies and grammatical structures, making them easier to study.</p><p> However, most Star Wars languages are not as fully developed as real-world languages or other fictional languages like Klingon (from Star Trek) or Dothraki (from Game of Thrones). Consequently, attaining fluency or participating in complex conversations might be challenging. Nevertheless, learning a Star Wars language can be an enjoyable and immersive way to immerse yourself in the franchise and connect with fellow fans.</p><h3 id="How-important-are-Star-Wars-languages-to-the-overall-universe"><a href="#How-important-are-Star-Wars-languages-to-the-overall-universe" class="headerlink" title="How important are Star Wars languages to the overall universe?"></a>How important are Star Wars languages to the overall universe?</h3><p> Star Wars languages play a major role in enriching the universe and making it more believable. By creating diverse and unique languages for every species, the creators of Star Wars crafted a more intricate galaxy. These languages contribute to the world-building process and help convey the immensity of the Star Wars universe, which spans numerous planets, each with its distinct inhabitants and customs.</p><p> While not every Star Wars language is fully developed, even the presence of distinct speech patterns and sounds adds depth and authenticity to the characters and their interactions.</p><h3 id="How-many-languages-are-there-in-Star-Wars"><a href="#How-many-languages-are-there-in-Star-Wars" class="headerlink" title="How many languages are there in Star Wars?"></a>How many languages are there in Star Wars?</h3><p> So far, we’ve been introduced to over 70 languages in the Star Wars universe. However, considering 3CPO’s affirmation that he’s “fluent in over six million forms of communication”, we figure there are still more languages to be discovered. We’ll have to keep an eye on future movie and series releases to find out.</p><p> That’s all for now.

For example, the first likely words of Old Tagalog origin are attested in the <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laguna%5FCopperplate%5FInscription" >Laguna Copperplate Inscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from 900 CE, a legal document which is largely written in Old Malay.</p><p> Prior to the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, the Tagalog language was written using the <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baybayin" >Baybayin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> system, a script which began to decline in the 17th century and became obsolete in the 18th century.</p><p> Spanish missionaries, who probably served as the first teachers in the area, introduced Filipinos to Christianity, the Latin alphabet and the Spanish language. Naturally, as you will see for yourself during your Tagalog training, Spanish, together with English, had a great influence on the <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History%5Fof%5Fthe%5FPhilippines" >Filipino language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that is today the official language of the Philipines and the standardized version of the Tagalog language.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tagalog-for-beginners-1-600x450.jpg"                      alt="tagalog for beginners" title="Learn Tagalog Online In Just 10 Minutes A Day 2"                ></p><p> “El Nido, Philippines” by Cris Tagupa©</p><p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> derived from_taga-ilog_ (“river dweller”), the word “tagalog” is probably connected to the origin of the Tagalog people, the second-largest ethnolinguistic group in the Philippines after the Visayan people.</p><h2 id="Tagalog-vs-Filipino-why-should-you-learn-Tagalog"><a href="#Tagalog-vs-Filipino-why-should-you-learn-Tagalog" class="headerlink" title="Tagalog vs Filipino: why should you learn Tagalog?"></a>Tagalog vs Filipino: why should you learn Tagalog?</h2><p> So what should you learn? Tagalog or Filipino? While Tagalog is largely spoken not only in the Philipines but also in the United States, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia, Filipino is the national language of the Philippines.</p><p> However, you should also know that despite being constitutionally-mandated as a national language, Filipino is only used as a tertiary language in the Philippine public sphere. So it’s way more likely to spark conversations in Tagalog than in Filipino while in Manila.</p><p> At the same time, it’s also true that Filipino was “born” from Tagalog and they do resemble. The vocabulary of the Filipino language is composed of around 80% Tagalog and the remaining 20% is a combination of English, Spanish, and other Philippine languages such as Cebuano. But that does not make them the same language.</p><p> Therefore,<strong>your language of choice should definitely be Tagalog</strong> as you’ll have a much easier time in your travels to the beautiful Philippines.</p><h2 id="The-languages-of-the-Philippines"><a href="#The-languages-of-the-Philippines" class="headerlink" title="The languages of the Philippines"></a>The languages of the Philippines</h2><p> Fun fact: did you know that the number of established languages listed for the Philippines is 186? According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.ethnologue.com/country/PH" >Ethnologue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , 184 of these are living and 2 are extinct. Of the total of 184 living languages, 175 are indigenous and 9 are non-indigenous. Furthermore, 37 are institutional, 68 are developing, 38 are vigorous, 30 are in trouble, and 11 are dying. Also listed are 3 unestablished languages.</p><p> Ten of the most used languages in the Philippines besides Tagalog, Filipino and English (an official language as well) are Cebuano, Ilocano, Hiligaynon, Waray-Waray, Kapampangan, Bicolano, Pangasinense, Maranaoan and Tausug.</p><h2 id="Tagalog-for-beginners-or-how-to-speak-Tagalog-fast"><a href="#Tagalog-for-beginners-or-how-to-speak-Tagalog-fast" class="headerlink" title="Tagalog for beginners or how to speak Tagalog fast"></a>Tagalog for beginners or how to speak Tagalog fast</h2><p> There are nine basic parts of speech in Tagalog: verbs_(pandiwa)_ , nouns_(pangngalan)_ , adjectives_(pang-uri)_ , adverbs_(pang-abay)_ , prepositions_(pang-ukol)_ , pronouns_(panghalip)_ , conjunctions_(pangatnig)_ , ligatures_(pang-angkop)_ and particles. Tagalog uses the verb-subject-object order and has fairly complex verb conjugation rules, but that won’t stop Mondly help you speak Tagalog from day 1.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/speak-tagalog-2-277x600.jpg"                      alt="speak tagalog" title="Learn Tagalog Online In Just 10 Minutes A Day 3"                ></p><p> Learn Tagalog with Mondly</p><p> While it is said that Tagalog is difficult to learn by English speakers, you’ll soon discover that the Tagalog vocabulary mimics many English and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Spanish words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

But what are their preferences when it comes to this topic?

Again, unsurprising is the fact that over 50% of university students choose to study in Spanish in order to hone their language skills. Seeing as not everybody in the US is fluent in English, learning this language actually improves the chances of finding a better job in the competitive job market and allows communication with more members of one’s community.</p><p> As the official language of 21 nations, it would be a great idea for a traveler to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >start learning Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  as soon as possible. Since we’re on the topic of learning on the internet, you must also know that Spanish is the third most utilized language online, after English and Chinese. English speakers usually pick Spanish as their secondary language because it’s easy to learn – with only approximately 600 hours of study time required. Want to sound like a fluent speaker? Here are <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >17 Spanish sayings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that will help you achieve that!</p><h2 id="2-French"><a href="#2-French" class="headerlink" title="2.

Americans seem to agree, also associating class and culture with French people. There’s no wonder then that Paris is still on top of the dream destinations for Americans traveling to Europe! Keep in mind that French is the only other language, apart from English, that is spoken on five continents.

If you thought about Cajuns, you’re on the right track! Americans usually prefer to learn French in order to increase employment opportunities and enjoy the rich culture and traditions. Cajun seasoning may have something to do with their decision, but we’re not sure.

Well, for starters, both English and German are West Germanic languages, which means the process will be easier than if you tried to learn Romanic languages. Americans picked up on that, as German is also the second most used language in the science community, after English, of course.</p><p> Taking into account that German is also an important business language, it’s no surprise that most of the students study German in order to work in Europe.</p><p> Word of caution, in terms of vocabulary, German might surprise you, to say the least. There are a couple of incredibly long words that are a nightmare to pronounce. Take for example “Rechtsschutzversicherungsgesellschaften”, a word that means insurance company that provides legal protection. If that didn’t discourage you, why not <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >start learning German <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ?!</p><h2 id="4-Italian"><a href="#4-Italian" class="headerlink" title="4.

American gangster movies are famous for their portrayal of Italian-Americans and Italian-American culture is basically a staple of American life. Not to mention the fact that many Americans are direct descendants of Italian immigrants, so they <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn Italian <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to communicate with nonna.</p><p> Italian is actually one of the top ten foreign languages spoken in the US today and if you are a culinary aficionado, you already know that pizza for Americans is as traditional as apple pie.

The language spectrum is wider here, as opposed to Europe for example. The collection of Asian languages includes Sino -Tibetan, Austronesian, Dravidian, Altaic and countless others. By the way, English is also spoken fluently as a second language in many countries in Asia. So, if you’re planning a trip to Asia, or wishing to study there, it’s about time you found out which are the most popular Asian languages!</p><p> The list has been put together by looking at the most common languages spoken in Asia, but also the most popular Asian and Pacific Island languages popular in the US and Europe and the most popular Asian languages for business. How to learn Asian languages? <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-6345&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6345&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6345" >Mondly’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> got your back!</p><p> So, without further ado, let’s discover which are the most popular Asian languages today!</p><h2 id="1-Chinese-Mandarin"><a href="#1-Chinese-Mandarin" class="headerlink" title="1.

Mandarin is the most spoken dialect and China’s official language. It belongs to the Sino-Tibetan language family and is somewhat similar to Cantonese.</p><p> Other known dialects are Cantonese, Hokkien, Xiang, Hakka, Min, Wu, and Yue. You should know that the language has over 100.000 special characters, which are called logograms, and its speakers use four distinct tones to communicate. There is also a neutral tone and each one of the five is used in order to differentiate between words. At least, all the dialects use the same writing system, phew… Don’t worry, we’ll start you off with something easy like <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >“hello” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >“thank you” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Chinese is also the third most common foreign language in the United States, with approximately 3.4 million speakers. By the way, it’s very possible that China will become the strongest economy by 2050, so you’d better <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >start learning Chinese online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  soon. Apparently, Chinese speakers use both sides of the brain, while English speakers only use their left side.</p><h2 id="2-Hindi"><a href="#2-Hindi" class="headerlink" title="2. Hindi"></a>2.

This Indo-Aryan derived language is spoken by approximately 550 million people, including here the residents of Fiji. Written in the Devanagari script, Hindi is also spoken by some 81 million people in the US. If you are a fan of Bollywood, this is the language for you!</p><p> Coming from Sanskrit, Hindi is the fourth most-spoken native language in the world, behind Chinese, Spanish and English, and it’s also incredibly similar to Urdu. The two languages are so similar that two speakers of Urdu and Hindi can understand each other without issues! Even though it is the most popular language in India, it is not in fact the national language. This is due to the fact that the Indian constitution does not specify a national language as such. By the way, Hindi is also one of the easiest languages to learn by English speakers, so you should definitely give it a go!</p><h2 id="3-Indonesian"><a href="#3-Indonesian" class="headerlink" title="3.

To be more precise, Indonesian is actually considered a dialect of Malay, with differences mainly when it comes to accent and vocabulary.</p><p> However, natives can certainly distinguish between the two with ease. Good news for the language enthusiasts, Indonesian uses Latin script, which makes it one of the least challenging Asian languages to learn. Another interesting fact is that Indonesian is the third most used language in WordPress, with an astounding 1.5 million blogs written in this language.</p><p> With 240 million speakers in Asia alone, Indonesian is actually more popular than Korean (sorry <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Squid Game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  fans) or Japanese, even though it’s hard to believe.

And if that’s not reason enough to<strong>study Portuguese</strong> right now, the Foreign Service Institute of the US Government claims that a native English speaker would only need around <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >600 hours <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or 24 weeks of study to<strong>reach fluency in Portuguese.</strong> So what are we waiting for? Let’s see what is<strong>the best way to study Portuguese</strong> and start learning it right now.</p><h2 id="1-Begin-your-Portuguese-training-with-the-best-language-learning-app-available"><a href="#1-Begin-your-Portuguese-training-with-the-best-language-learning-app-available" class="headerlink" title="1.

With Mondly, the award-winning language learning app, the Portuguese language will literally become glued into your brain after just a few weeks of training.</p><p> Featuring compact Daily Lessons, vocabulary builders to help you<strong>learn new Portuguese words fast</strong> , real and simulated conversations to get you fluent on the go and much more,<a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-3107&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-3107?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=br&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-3107?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=br" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> puts your brain on autopilot while you simply enjoy your trip to Portuguese fluency.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-3107&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-3107?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=br&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-3107?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=br" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> doesn’t necessarily teach advanced Portuguese grammar. Instead, it focuses on getting you fluent in Portuguese using the inductive method – learn by doing, context and example, and extrapolate to rules. That sounds like a great start for your<strong>Portuguese training,</strong> doesn’t it?</p><h2 id="2-Read-children’s-books-in-Portuguese"><a href="#2-Read-children’s-books-in-Portuguese" class="headerlink" title="2. Read children’s books in Portuguese"></a>2. Read children’s books in Portuguese</h2><p> Now that you know quite a few <strong><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Portuguese words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and phrases,</strong> you can continue your training with reading on a Kindle. Why a Kindle? Because it has an integrated vocabulary that allows you to see a word’s definition by simply tapping on it. The enthusiasm of discovering<strong>new Portuguese words</strong> by your own will help you learn faster.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/portuguese-training-1024x678.jpg"                      alt="portuguese training" title="The Best Way To Study Portuguese - 6 Tips That Will Work Wonders 2"                ></p><p> “Outdoor Kindle reading” by James Tarbotton©</p><p> And what better reading material is there than children’s books? Yes, you read that right. Since you are only at the beginning of your Portuguese journey, children’s books are the most suitable for your level of proficiency. From easier books you can then move to_O Principezinho_ (“The Little Prince”) by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and then to_Harry Potter e a Pedra Filosofal_ (“Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone”) by J. K. Rowling.</p><p> Meanwhile, also continue your daily training in the language learning app. Because<strong>learning Portuguese</strong> – or any other language – is like a war on multiple fronts. If your strategy is good, you’ll win on all of them. If not, you could get stuck in a siege forever. So be smart and you’ll learn faster than you think.</p><h2 id="3-Use-flashcards-for-those-Portuguese-words-that-can’t-seem-to-stick"><a href="#3-Use-flashcards-for-those-Portuguese-words-that-can’t-seem-to-stick" class="headerlink" title="3. Use flashcards for those Portuguese words that can’t seem to stick"></a>3. Use flashcards for those Portuguese words that can’t seem to stick</h2><p> Some<strong>Portuguese words</strong> just won’t stick. A lot of people know your pain. We’ve all been there. Luckily, flashcards will do the trick. Put down on sticky notes the most stubborn words and make sure you’ll see them every day (by the bed may be a good place for them). Before you know it, you’ll find yourself mastering the very Portuguese words that caused you headaches just a while ago.</p><h2 id="4-Train-your-ears-with-TV-series-movies-music-or-short-videos-in-Portuguese"><a href="#4-Train-your-ears-with-TV-series-movies-music-or-short-videos-in-Portuguese" class="headerlink" title="4. Train your ears with TV series, movies, music or short videos in Portuguese"></a>4. Train your ears with TV series, movies, music or short videos in Portuguese</h2><p> Did you ever notice that when you spend some time in another country and then come home, it seems to you that you still hear people speaking the same language they did abroad? That’s mesmerizing, isn’t it? Well, your brain got used to the language. And in order to<strong>boost your Portuguese skills</strong> , you have to have the same experience with Portuguese.</p><p> Watching<strong>Portuguese movies,</strong> TV series, short videos or listening to<strong>Portuguese music</strong> doesn’t sound like such a drudgery, doesn’t it? Well, that’s what you’ll have to do in order to train your ears for the Portuguese language. So do some research, choose what suits you best and speak Portuguese like you never knew you could!</p><p> No ideas? Start with this classic <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fado" >Fado <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Português from Amália Rodrigues:</p><h2 id="5-Talk-to-yourself-in-Portuguese"><a href="#5-Talk-to-yourself-in-Portuguese" class="headerlink" title="5. Talk to yourself in Portuguese"></a>5. Talk to yourself in Portuguese</h2><p> If you can’t find any online friends to help you<strong>practice Portuguese</strong> , you can even talk to yourself. Not by yourself, but to yourself. As crazy as that sounds, expressing your thoughts in Portuguese can help you master the language faster. If you prove to be persevering, you’ll soon discover that you will be able to form a line of thought directly into<strong>the Portuguese language.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/learn-portuguese-1024x682.jpg"                      alt="learn portuguese" title="The Best Way To Study Portuguese - 6 Tips That Will Work Wonders 3"                ></p><p> “Madeira, Portugal” by Adam Śmigielski©</p><h2 id="Bonus-tip-Stay-positive-and-book-your-trip-to-Brazil-or-Portugal-ASAP"><a href="#Bonus-tip-Stay-positive-and-book-your-trip-to-Brazil-or-Portugal-ASAP" class="headerlink" title="Bonus tip: Stay positive and book your trip to Brazil or Portugal ASAP"></a>Bonus tip: Stay positive and book your trip to Brazil or Portugal ASAP</h2><p> What language do you want to learn?<strong>Brazilian Portuguese</strong> or<strong>European Portuguese?</strong> Well, whatever your choice, go to momondo and book your holiday right now.

Slovak is the official language of Slovakia and one of the 24 official languages of the European Union.</p><p> Not be confused with Slovene (or Slovenian), which is a South Slavic language, the Slovak language has been extensively influenced by Latin, German and other Slavic languages. In fact, according to <a class="link"   href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Slovak-language" >Encyclopædia Britannica <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , there are traces of the Slovak language in Latin documents as early as the 11th century.</p><p> However, the <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History%5Fof%5Fthe%5FSlovak%5Flanguage" >earliest-known attempts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to increase the use of written Slovak came in the 17th and 18th centuries, when the language was standardized and the first important books in and about Slovak appeared. Probably the most important among these were <em>The <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Czech <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Grammar</em> (1603) and Romuald Hadvabný of Červený Kláštor’s_Latin-Slovak Dictionary_ (1763).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/slovak-language-course-277x600.jpg"                      alt="slovak language course" title="Learn Slovak Online In Just 10 Minutes A Day 2"                ></p><p> Learn Slovak with Mondly</p><h2 id="Slovak-vs-Czech-–-how-similar-are-they"><a href="#Slovak-vs-Czech-–-how-similar-are-they" class="headerlink" title="Slovak vs Czech – how similar are they?"></a>Slovak vs Czech – how similar are they?</h2><p> As you probably already know, the sister language of Slovak is Czech (also available to <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-4562&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-4562?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=cs&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-4562?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=cs" >learn in Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) because of their very high degree of mutual intelligibility. Meaning, if you already know one language you will probably understand a great deal of the second.</p><p> Czech and Slovak had <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak%5Flanguage" >long historic ties <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> well before the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, a state which existed until 1993. Literary Slovak shares significant orthographic features with Czech, as well as technical and professional terminology dating from the Czechoslovak period, but phonetic, grammatical and vocabulary differences do exist.</p><p> To give you a better idea of their intelligibility degree, we could roughly describe the differences between Czech and Slovak by making parallels with British English and American English: different vocabulary here and there, false cognates, varied syntax, localized idioms, and different vocabulary and slang.</p><p> Other languages that share history and vocabulary with Slovak are Latin, German, Czech, Hungarian,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Polish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Greek.</p><h2 id="10-basic-Slovak-phrases-and-words-you-can-learn-right-now"><a href="#10-basic-Slovak-phrases-and-words-you-can-learn-right-now" class="headerlink" title="10 basic Slovak phrases and words you can learn right now"></a>10 basic Slovak phrases and words you can learn right now</h2><p> Are you excited to learn Slovak yet?

After all, that’s the Italian way. You don’t really speak Italian if you don’t use <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >gestures <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . That is, if you’re not flirting through Tinder, Bumble or any other dating app. If that’s the case, you can rely solely on the charm of your written words to win hearts. Either way, the following list of Italian pick up lines are cheesy enough to work in both cases.</p><p> Before we get on with it, one question remains: are Italians as romantic as they are depicted in popular culture? Well, in a way, yes. Italian men are quite often passionate and romantic, but Italian women are usually not too fond of excessive sweetness from strangers. However, they do love a good joke. And that’s exactly where pick up lines come in!</p><p> <em>Roses are red; violets are blue, we made this<strong>Italian pick up lines</strong> list only for you.</em> 😏</p><h2 id="Funny-Pick-Up-Lines-in-Italian"><a href="#Funny-Pick-Up-Lines-in-Italian" class="headerlink" title="Funny Pick Up Lines in Italian"></a>Funny Pick Up Lines in Italian</h2><ul><li><em>Eccomi, scusa per il ritardo, è molto che mi aspetti?</em> (“Here I am, sorry I’m late, have you been waiting long?”)</li><li><em>Sto scrivendo un libro di numeri telefonici.

And no, we’re not talking about the Mexican soap opera for people who only had 3 weeks of Spanish in the 4th grade_(wink wink)_ . In all seriousness, how do you reply to the question that has been on everybody’s lips at one point? How do you tell the time in Spanish? Well, it’s time_(wink wink)_ to find out.</p><p> I know what you think and it’s true. We’re lucky enough to live in an era of rapid technological advancements. Even if you don’t own a watch, you probably have a smartphone. Asking or telling the time in Spanish or any other language may seem obsolete. But what if your phone’s battery is dead? I for one had a pretty interesting experience when I had to survive one week without a phone. I kept asking random people the time to make sure I wasn’t late and they looked at me like I was some kind of an alien. So yeah, knowing how to tell the time in Spanish can make all the difference!</p><p> One more thing! If you’ve learned <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >how to count in Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it will be extremely easy for you.</p><p>But first things first.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/cAEm5rSuuBEGY/giphy.gif"                      alt="Spanish time" title="How To Tell Time In Spanish - A Complete Guide For Beginners 2"                ></p><h2 id="¿Que-hora-es-–-how-to-ask-for-the-time-in-Spanish"><a href="#¿Que-hora-es-–-how-to-ask-for-the-time-in-Spanish" class="headerlink" title="¿Que hora es? – how to ask for the time in Spanish"></a>¿Que hora es? – how to ask for the time in Spanish</h2><p> In order to tell the time in Spanish, you’ll first have to learn how to properly ask for the time in Spanish. You can never be too cautious. I’m just making sure you’re not missing that_fiesta española_ you spent weeks thinking about!</p><p> In addition to the now well-known_<strong>¿que hora es?</strong>_ which literally translates to “what hour is it?”, you can also ask_<strong>¿tiene hora?</strong>_ which is literally “do you have the hour?”. Easy enough!</p><h2 id="The-basics-of-Spanish-time"><a href="#The-basics-of-Spanish-time" class="headerlink" title="The basics of Spanish time"></a>The basics of Spanish time</h2><p> To_decir la hora_ (“tell the time”) in Spanish, there are a few simple rules you’ll have to know.</p><p> First of all, always use the verb**<em>ser</em>** . No, not_estar_ , but_ser_ . If you don’t know what <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Spanish verbs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are all about, you might want to check this little <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >guide for beginners <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . To put it simply, time is a permanent entity that requires the use of the verb_ser_ .</p><p> Secondly, remember that only when talking about one o’clock, you’ll need to use the <strong>third person singular form of_ser_ .</strong> For all the other eleven hours, you can safely go with the plural form. Here’s how to tell the time in Spanish if the time is on the hour:</p><ul><li><em><strong>Es</strong> la una.</em> – It’s one o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las dos.</em> – It’s two o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las tres.</em> – It’s three o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las cuatro.</em> – It’s four o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las cinco.</em> – It’s five o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las seis.</em> – It’s six o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las siete.</em> – It’s seven o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las ocho.</em> – It’s eight o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las nueve.</em> – It’s nine o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las diez.</em> – It’s ten o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las once.</em> – It’s eleven o’clock.</li><li><em><strong>Son</strong> las doce.</em> – It’s twelve o’clock.</li></ul><p> As you can see, the feminine article (<em>la&#x2F;las</em>) is used before the number. Why is that? Well, because it refers to_la hora_ . But again, remember that the singular form**<em>la</em>** will only be used in the case of<strong>“one o’clock”</strong> because we’re talking about a single hour.</p><p><em><strong>Nota bene:</strong></em> If you prefer to use the 24-hour clock, you should say**<em>son las dieciséis</em>** <strong>(“it’s 16:00”)</strong> instead of <strong><em>son las cuatro</em> (“it’s 4 o’clock p.m.”).</strong> But that will require a little more studying on your part. Don’t worry though. Spanish numbers are just as easy as learning how to tell the time. You can master them with Mondly faster than you can say Jack Robinson. You can get started <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5345&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5345?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=es&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5345?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=es" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h3 id="How-do-you-say-the-time-in-Spanish-after-30"><a href="#How-do-you-say-the-time-in-Spanish-after-30" class="headerlink" title="How do you say the time in Spanish after 30?"></a>How do you say the time in Spanish after 30?</h3><p> Now, the time is not always on the hour. So how do you say “half past”, “quarter past” and “quarter to” in Spanish? There are only two new words you need to remember:<em><strong>media</strong></em> and_<strong>cuarto</strong>_ .</p><ul><li>If it’s<strong>half past</strong> the hour in Spanish, use the phrase_<strong>y media</strong>_ ;</li><li>If it’s a<strong>quarter past</strong> the hour, use the phrase_<strong>y cuarto</strong>_ ;</li><li>If it’s<strong>a quarter until the hour,</strong> use the phrase**<em>menos cuarto</em>** .</li></ul><p>Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>2:30 –<em>Son las dos y media.</em> – It’s two thirty.</li><li>1:15 –<em>Es la una y cuarto.</em> – It’s one fifteen.</li><li>5:45 –<em>Son las seis menos cuarto.</em> – It’s a quarter until six.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/telling-time-in-spanish-600x600.jpg"                      alt="telling time in spanish" title="How To Tell Time In Spanish - A Complete Guide For Beginners 3"                ></p><p> Telling time in Spanish – a visual guide</p><h3 id="Hour-minutes-in-Spanish-time"><a href="#Hour-minutes-in-Spanish-time" class="headerlink" title="Hour + minutes in Spanish time"></a>Hour + minutes in Spanish time</h3><p> Wanna be a little more specific? Here’s how Spanish time works when you need to indicate the exact number of minutes that have past from the hour.</p><p> The simplest formula is <strong><em>es&#x2F;son</em> + las + hour + number of minutes.</strong> For example, if you want to say that it’s_<strong>3:29</strong>_ , you’ll say**<em>son las tres veintinueve.</em>**</p><p> Thus, the same as in English, there will be two ways in which you can indicate some hours in Spanish. If it’s 8:15, you can say:</p><ul><li><em>Son las ocho y cuarto.</em> (“it’s a quarter past eight”)</li><li><em>Son las ocho y quince.</em> (“it’s eight and fifteen minutes”)</li></ul><h3 id="Different-ways-of-telling-time-in-Spanish"><a href="#Different-ways-of-telling-time-in-Spanish" class="headerlink" title="Different ways of telling time in Spanish"></a>Different ways of telling time in Spanish</h3><p> There are three formulas of telling time in Spanish. Here are different ways of telling it’s 3:10:</p><ul><li><em>es&#x2F;son</em> +<em>las</em> + hour + number of minutes –_<strong>Son las tres diez</strong>_</li><li><em>es&#x2F;son</em> +<em>las</em> + hour + y + number of minutes –**<em>Son las tres y diez</em>**</li><li><em>es&#x2F;son</em> +<em>las</em> + hour + con + number of minutes –**<em>Son las tres con diez</em>**</li></ul><p> Which one do you prefer? Additionally, if we also count it_cuarto_ and_media_ , there are no less than four different ways to tell the time in Spanish. And you’ve just mastered them all!</p><h2 id="How-to-indicate-the-time-of-day-in-Spanish"><a href="#How-to-indicate-the-time-of-day-in-Spanish" class="headerlink" title="How to indicate the time of day in Spanish"></a>How to indicate the time of day in Spanish</h2><p> If you are using the 12-hour clock, you sometimes might want to also point out the time of day. For instance, “it’s two in the afternoon” translates to_<strong>son las dos de la tarde</strong>_ in Spanish. Not too complicated, is it? Here are some more times of day that might come in handy:</p><ul><li><em>mediodía</em> – midday</li><li><em>mañana</em> – in the morning</li><li><em>noche</em> – at night</li><li><em>madrugada</em> – the middle of the night</li><li><em>medianoche</em> – midnight</li><li><em>amanecer</em> – dawn</li><li><em>tarde</em> – in the afternoon</li></ul><p> To indicate that an event occurs at a specific time, use the formula <strong>a +<em>la(s)</em> + time</strong> :<em>La clase de español empieza a las nueve</em> – “The Spanish class begins at 9”.</p><h3 id="Other-useful-time-phrases-in-Spanish"><a href="#Other-useful-time-phrases-in-Spanish" class="headerlink" title="Other useful time phrases in Spanish"></a>Other useful time phrases in Spanish</h3><ul><li><em>por la mañana</em> – in the morning</li><li><em>por la tarde</em> – in the afternoon</li><li><em>de la tarde</em> – in the afternoon</li><li><em>al mediodía</em> – at noon</li><li><em>a la medianoche</em> – at midnight</li><li><em>por la noche</em> – in the evening or night</li><li><em>de la noche</em> – in the evening or night</li><li><em>la mañana</em> – morning or tomorrow</li><li><em>mañana por la mañana</em> – tomorrow morning</li><li><em>pasado mañana</em> – the day after tomorrow</li><li><em>tarde</em> – late</li><li><em>temprano</em> – early</li><li><em>en punto</em> – exactly or sharp (son <em>las ocho en punto</em> – “it’s exactly eight o’clock”)</li><li><em>ayer</em> – yesterday</li><li><em>anteayer</em> – the day before yesterday</li><li><em>anoche</em> – last night</li><li><em>la noche anterior, anteanoche</em> – the night before last</li><li><em>el lunes que viene</em> – next Monday</li><li><em>el lunes pasado</em> – last Monday</li><li><em>la semana que viene</em> – next week</li><li><em>semana por medio</em> – every other week</li><li><em>la semana pasada</em> – last week</li><li><em>el año que viene</em> – next year</li><li><em>el año pasado</em> – last year</li><li><em>durante el día</em> – during the day</li></ul><p> A guide for telling the time in Spanish ends here but it doesn’t mean stop <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learning Spanish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Fluency is required to kick-start a conversation and it takes years of practice to achieve it. Myths like these prevent people from even trying to learn a new language. And, as many have seen before, these myths are nothing more than just… myths.</p><p> Here are the most common myths and the way in which reality comes to the rescue:</p><h2 id="1-Not-everyone-can-learn-a-foreign-language"><a href="#1-Not-everyone-can-learn-a-foreign-language" class="headerlink" title="1. Not everyone can learn a foreign language"></a>1. Not everyone can learn a foreign language</h2><p> False! Everyone with the right motivation can learn a foreign language. The amount of effort and time invested is different for experienced learners and beginners, but the fact remains that anyone can do it. Once you ‘learn how to learn’, certain patterns become visible, especially with grammar, and this makes learning much faster.</p><h2 id="2-Language-learning-requires-a-high-IQ"><a href="#2-Language-learning-requires-a-high-IQ" class="headerlink" title="2. Language learning requires a high IQ"></a>2. Language learning requires a high IQ</h2><p> So untrue! There are so many smart people who only speak one language. This is because a high IQ doesn’t make anyone a natural-born <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >polyglot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . An average IQ combined with persuasiveness, sensitivity and lots of practice is a much better recipe for becoming fluent in another language.</p><h2 id="3-Failing-to-learn-a-language-in-school-makes-the-student-incompetent"><a href="#3-Failing-to-learn-a-language-in-school-makes-the-student-incompetent" class="headerlink" title="3. Failing to learn a language in school makes the student incompetent"></a>3. Failing to learn a language in school makes the student incompetent</h2><p> There are so many stories of students who left school thinking that they were incapable of learning French or Spanish, and later in life, they became fluent within a few months of living in Latin countries. The reason why students fail to learn a language in school is mostly due to the professor’s incompetence.</p><h2 id="4-Grammar-is-difficult"><a href="#4-Grammar-is-difficult" class="headerlink" title="4. Grammar is difficult"></a>4. Grammar is difficult</h2><p> Here’s a fun fact: grammar is a language’s least difficult element and it takes the least time to master. Every language, no matter how remote, is built on clear grammar rules and the experienced learner can easily figure out patterns that he or she can use to accelerate the learning process.</p><h2 id="5-Conversations-require-fluency"><a href="#5-Conversations-require-fluency" class="headerlink" title="5. Conversations require fluency"></a>5. Conversations require fluency</h2><p> When it comes to mastering a foreign language, fluency means knowing around 5000 words. That’s a lot, considering that it takes quite some time to build such a vocabulary. Here’s the good news – having a conversation with someone from another country requires only a basic command of the language, which is around 1500 words. And here’s the even better news – very basic needs such as courtesy and traveling require an even smaller set of words and phrases, and anyone can learn these on a flight to a foreign country.</p><p> There are many such myths that make language learning seem either difficult or impossible. We at Mondly believe that there’s nothing too difficult or impossible about it. To illustrate this with an example, here’s a story from one of our users:</p><blockquote><p><em>I have always found languages very difficult and therefore not any good at learning them. At 82 years old I know [Mondly] it’s going to be very helpful when I spend time in Spain this and next year. Thank you.</em> (Alan, United Kingdom)</p></blockquote><p>Thank YOU, Alan!</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/5-myths-language-learning/&t=5+Myths+About+Language+Learning"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h4 id="Speak-a-new-language-in-just-10-minutes-a-day"><a href="#Speak-a-new-language-in-just-10-minutes-a-day" class="headerlink" title="Speak a new language in just 10 minutes a day"></a>Speak a new language in just 10 minutes a day</h4><p> With Mondly, the award-winning language learning app, you’ll speak any language from day 1.

This amazing country gave us Tchaikovsky and his timeless music, but it also gave us the funniest YouTube videos. So if you are a truly passionate traveler, you should not miss it. Its unique history and culture await to be explored on the scene. Besides, there are a lot of tourist attractions in Russia that everyone must visit at least once in their lives. The Kremlin, Hermitage Museum, Lake Baikal, Saint Basil’s Cathedral, Bolshoi Theatre, and Mount Elbrus are just a few of them. And since FIFA World Cup 2018 is happening in Russia, as I write, I figured you could use some basic <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Russian phrases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you decide to kill two birds with one stone and visit Russia while you are attending the World Cup.

And when it comes to English, many people agree that Australian slang is the richest, liveliest and funniest slang you could learn. Sure, there’s always British English, but the Brits don’t call their barbecue “barbie”. And that’s a missed opportunity. Wouldn’t you agree? How can you have just a plain, dull barbecue when you could have a “barbie”? The Aussie slang is the best slang.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Popular-Australian-Slang-Terms-Words"><a href="#Top-10-Popular-Australian-Slang-Terms-Words" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Popular Australian Slang Terms &amp; Words"></a>Top 10 Popular Australian Slang Terms &amp; Words</h2><p> Let’s start with the basics: core Australian slang vocabulary. Here’s a list of popular Australian slang terms you probably heard before but didn’t know what they meant.</p><h3 id="1-Ta-–-Thank-you"><a href="#1-Ta-–-Thank-you" class="headerlink" title="1.Ta – Thank you"></a>1.<em>Ta</em> – Thank you</h3><p> You can also use “thanks heaps” when you are really grateful to someone for doing something for you or “cheers” to combine both “thank you”‌ and “goodbye” ‌in a single word. For example, “cheers” is a perfect choice for leaving the shop after the barista gives you your coffee.</p><h3 id="2-Brekkie-–-Breakfast"><a href="#2-Brekkie-–-Breakfast" class="headerlink" title="2.Brekkie – Breakfast"></a>2.<em>Brekkie</em> – Breakfast</h3><p> Although it sounds like breakfast for kids, brekkie is the Australian meal everyone has in the morning.</p><p><em>“So… what did you have for brekkie today?”</em></p><h3 id="3-Barbie-–-Barbecue"><a href="#3-Barbie-–-Barbecue" class="headerlink" title="3.Barbie – Barbecue"></a>3.<em>Barbie</em> – Barbecue</h3><p>Well, I don’t mind if you call me a “barbie girl” now.</p><h3 id="4-Crikey-–-An-Exclamation-of-Surprise"><a href="#4-Crikey-–-An-Exclamation-of-Surprise" class="headerlink" title="4.Crikey! – An Exclamation of Surprise"></a>4.<em>Crikey!</em> – An Exclamation of Surprise</h3><p> Famously used by Steve Irwin. It’s similar to the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >British English slang <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> “blimey!”.</p><h3 id="5-Cake-Hole-–-Mouth"><a href="#5-Cake-Hole-–-Mouth" class="headerlink" title="5.Cake Hole – Mouth"></a>5.<em>Cake Hole</em> – Mouth</h3><p> There’s no better replacement for the word “mouth”. Why isn’t everybody using this?</p><h3 id="6-Ankle-Biter-–-A-Small-or-Young-Child"><a href="#6-Ankle-Biter-–-A-Small-or-Young-Child" class="headerlink" title="6.Ankle-Biter – A Small or Young Child"></a>6.<em>Ankle-Biter</em> – A Small or Young Child</h3><p>It can also refer to a small, aggressive dog like a chihuahua.</p><h3 id="7-Bogan-–-An-Uncultured-or-Unsophisticated-Person"><a href="#7-Bogan-–-An-Uncultured-or-Unsophisticated-Person" class="headerlink" title="7.Bogan – An Uncultured or Unsophisticated Person"></a>7.<em>Bogan</em> – An Uncultured or Unsophisticated Person</h3><p> A “bogan” is an uncouth or unrefined person regarded as being of low social status. The term is usually pejorative, but it can also be regarded as a joke between friends.</p><h3 id="8-Bush-Telly-–-What-You-Watch-at-Night-When-You-Are-Camping"><a href="#8-Bush-Telly-–-What-You-Watch-at-Night-When-You-Are-Camping" class="headerlink" title="8.Bush Telly – What You Watch at Night When You Are Camping"></a>8.<em>Bush Telly</em> – What You Watch at Night When You Are Camping</h3><p> You heard “telly” before, but “bush telly”? That’s a new one. Basically, when you are camping, you can’t watch traditional television, so you watch the “bush telly”: the campfire, the stars or just… the bush.</p><h3 id="9-Bikkie-–-Biscuit"><a href="#9-Bikkie-–-Biscuit" class="headerlink" title="9.Bikkie – Biscuit"></a>9.<em>Bikkie</em> – Biscuit</h3><p>You’ll ask for a “bikkie” just to hear yourself say it.</p><p> There’s also the very cute expression “to cost big bikkies”, meaning that something is very expensive.</p><h3 id="10-Mate-–-Friend"><a href="#10-Mate-–-Friend" class="headerlink" title="10.Mate – Friend"></a>10.<em>Mate</em> – Friend</h3><p><em>Oi, mate!</em> This one’s a classic.

Phrases"></a>Funny Australian Slang Phrases</h2><p> If it weren’t for this list, you’d need an Australian slang translator when you hear these Australian slang phrases! Use them in your day-to-day conversations and Aussies might think you’re one of their own.</p><h3 id="1-What’s-the-John-Dory"><a href="#1-What’s-the-John-Dory" class="headerlink" title="1. What’s the John Dory?"></a>1. What’s the John Dory?</h3><p><strong>What’s going on?</strong></p><p> John Dory is an edible fish found on the coasts of Africa, Southeast Asia, New Zealand, and – of course – Australia. There’s no secret story to it apart from the fact that it just rhymes with ‘story’. So, instead of asking,<em>“what’s the story?”</em> , in Australian slang, you ask_“what’s the John Dory?”_ .</p><h3 id="2-Chuck-a-sickie"><a href="#2-Chuck-a-sickie" class="headerlink" title="2. Chuck a sickie"></a>2. Chuck a sickie</h3><p><strong>Call in sick without actually being sick.</strong></p><p> If you ever took a day off work pretending to be sick, you’re guilty of chucking a sickie.<em>“I’m chucking a sickie to go to the beach. Wanna join?”</em></p><h3 id="3-Fair-dinkum"><a href="#3-Fair-dinkum" class="headerlink" title="3. Fair dinkum"></a>3. Fair dinkum</h3><p><strong>Honest, true or genuine.</strong></p><p> Popular Australian exclamation often used to emphasize or seek confirmation (if used with the proper intonation) of the genuineness or truth of something.<em>“This pork barbie is fair dinkum!”</em></p><h3 id="4-Wrap-your-laughing-gear-‘round-that"><a href="#4-Wrap-your-laughing-gear-‘round-that" class="headerlink" title="4. Wrap your laughing gear ‘round that"></a>4. Wrap your laughing gear ‘round that</h3><p><strong>Eat that.</strong></p><p> What’s your laughing gear? Your mouth, of course. So, when you wrap your laughing gear ‘round something, you… eat it. It can be used in either a friendly or threatening way.</p><h3 id="5-Carrying-on-like-a-pork-chop"><a href="#5-Carrying-on-like-a-pork-chop" class="headerlink" title="5. Carrying on like a pork chop"></a>5. Carrying on like a pork chop</h3><p><strong>To behave foolishly.</strong></p><p>Let me get my Australian slang translator for this one. 😅</p><p>It seems that this phrase has had a lot of variations:</p><ul><li>Carrying on like a pork chop in Jerusalem on a Saturday.</li><li>Carrying on like a pork chop at a Jewish wedding.</li><li>Carrying on like a pork chop in a synagogue.</li></ul><p> While the original message referred to an object that is out of place, the modern meaning has slightly shifted. So, when you hear someone using this Australian slang phrase, know that they are referring to someone who behaves foolishly, makes a fuss, complains, or rants.</p><h3 id="6-Dog’s-breakfast"><a href="#6-Dog’s-breakfast" class="headerlink" title="6. Dog’s breakfast"></a>6. Dog’s breakfast</h3><p><strong>Complete chaos, mess.</strong></p><p> You can think of it this way: what does a dog’s breakfast consist of? Leftovers. Chicken bones or maybe a half-eaten pizza from last night. So, if something is really messy or disordered, then it looks like a dog’s breakfast.</p><h3 id="7-Do-the-Harry"><a href="#7-Do-the-Harry" class="headerlink" title="7. Do the Harry"></a>7. Do the Harry</h3><p><strong>Disappear.</strong></p><p> The complete phrase is known as “to do a Harold Holt”, which is rhyming slang for “bolt”. The story behind this Australian slang phrase is related to Harold Holt, the 17th prime minister of Australia. In 1967, Mr. Holt disappeared, presumably by drowning, while swimming along Victoria’s coast.</p><p>Some say he “did the bolt” from his responsibilities as a prime minister.</p><h3 id="8-No-worries-mate-she’ll-be-apples"><a href="#8-No-worries-mate-she’ll-be-apples" class="headerlink" title="8.

According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.ethnologue.com/language/urd" >Ethnologue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Urdu is the 11th most widely spoken language in the world with 170 million total speakers. Hence, learning Urdu with Mondly could come in extremely handy if you ever visit South Asia.</p><p> Also known as one of the premier languages of poetry in South Asia for two centuries, Urdu is written right-to-left using the Urdu alphabet, an extension of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Persian <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> alphabet, which is itself an extension of the Arabic alphabet. Nevertheless, Urdu speakers in India have recently adopted Devanagari for publishing Urdu periodicals.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/urdu-learning-for-beginners-1-562x600.jpg"                      alt="urdu learning for beginners" title="Learn Urdu Online In Just 10 Minutes A Day 2"                ></p><p> Learn Urdu with Mondly</p><p> One of the most fascinating things about <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu" >Urdu <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is that its colloquial variant is largely mutually intelligible with colloquial Hindi (also available to learn with <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-4511&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-4511?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=hi&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-4511?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=hi" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ). In fact, these two are so similar in phonology and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >grammar that they appear to be one language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . However, both languages have borrowed extensively from different sources and use different writing systems (<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Hindi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> uses Devanagari).</p><p> Moreover, in the 19th century, the Hindi–Urdu <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi%E2%80%93Urdu%5Fcontroversy" >controversy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> arose in colonial India. The debate was whether Hindi or Urdu should be chosen as a national language. In 1900, the government issued a decree granting symbolic equal status to both Hindi and Urdu. But then, Gandhi proposed using either Devanagari or Urdu script, under the traditional generic term Hindustani. Therefore, in 1950, Hindi, in the Devanagari script, along with English, replaced Urdu as one of the official languages of India.</p><h2 id="Learn-Urdu-from-Hindi-Arabic-English-Korean-and-more"><a href="#Learn-Urdu-from-Hindi-Arabic-English-Korean-and-more" class="headerlink" title="Learn Urdu from Hindi, Arabic, English, Korean and more"></a>Learn Urdu from Hindi, Arabic, English, Korean and more</h2><p> You spoke.

And if that’s not reason enough to<strong>study Portuguese</strong> right now, the Foreign Service Institute of the US Government claims that a native English speaker would only need around <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >600 hours <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or 24 weeks of study to<strong>reach fluency in Portuguese.</strong> So what are we waiting for? Let’s see what is<strong>the best way to study Portuguese</strong> and start learning it right now.</p><h2 id="1-Begin-your-Portuguese-training-with-the-best-language-learning-app-available"><a href="#1-Begin-your-Portuguese-training-with-the-best-language-learning-app-available" class="headerlink" title="1.

Instead, it focuses on getting you fluent in Portuguese using the inductive method – learn by doing, context and example, and extrapolate to rules. That sounds like a great start for your<strong>Portuguese training,</strong> doesn’t it?</p><h2 id="2-Read-children’s-books-in-Portuguese"><a href="#2-Read-children’s-books-in-Portuguese" class="headerlink" title="2.

Read children’s books in Portuguese</h2><p> Now that you know quite a few <strong><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Portuguese words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and phrases,</strong> you can continue your training with reading on a Kindle. Why a Kindle? Because it has an integrated vocabulary that allows you to see a word’s definition by simply tapping on it. The enthusiasm of discovering<strong>new Portuguese words</strong> by your own will help you learn faster.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/portuguese-training-1024x678.jpg"                      alt="portuguese training" title="The Best Way To Study Portuguese - 6 Tips That Will Work Wonders 2"                ></p><p> “Outdoor Kindle reading” by James Tarbotton©</p><p> And what better reading material is there than children’s books? Yes, you read that right. Since you are only at the beginning of your Portuguese journey, children’s books are the most suitable for your level of proficiency. From easier books you can then move to_O Principezinho_ (“The Little Prince”) by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and then to_Harry Potter e a Pedra Filosofal_ (“Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone”) by J. K. Rowling.</p><p> Meanwhile, also continue your daily training in the language learning app. Because<strong>learning Portuguese</strong> – or any other language – is like a war on multiple fronts. If your strategy is good, you’ll win on all of them. If not, you could get stuck in a siege forever. So be smart and you’ll learn faster than you think.</p><h2 id="3-Use-flashcards-for-those-Portuguese-words-that-can’t-seem-to-stick"><a href="#3-Use-flashcards-for-those-Portuguese-words-that-can’t-seem-to-stick" class="headerlink" title="3.

Use flashcards for those Portuguese words that can’t seem to stick</h2><p> Some<strong>Portuguese words</strong> just won’t stick. A lot of people know your pain. We’ve all been there. Luckily, flashcards will do the trick. Put down on sticky notes the most stubborn words and make sure you’ll see them every day (by the bed may be a good place for them). Before you know it, you’ll find yourself mastering the very Portuguese words that caused you headaches just a while ago.</p><h2 id="4-Train-your-ears-with-TV-series-movies-music-or-short-videos-in-Portuguese"><a href="#4-Train-your-ears-with-TV-series-movies-music-or-short-videos-in-Portuguese" class="headerlink" title="4.

Train your ears with TV series, movies, music or short videos in Portuguese</h2><p> Did you ever notice that when you spend some time in another country and then come home, it seems to you that you still hear people speaking the same language they did abroad? That’s mesmerizing, isn’t it? Well, your brain got used to the language. And in order to<strong>boost your Portuguese skills</strong> , you have to have the same experience with Portuguese.</p><p> Watching<strong>Portuguese movies,</strong> TV series, short videos or listening to<strong>Portuguese music</strong> doesn’t sound like such a drudgery, doesn’t it? Well, that’s what you’ll have to do in order to train your ears for the Portuguese language. So do some research, choose what suits you best and speak Portuguese like you never knew you could!</p><p> No ideas? Start with this classic <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fado" >Fado <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Português from Amália Rodrigues:</p><h2 id="5-Talk-to-yourself-in-Portuguese"><a href="#5-Talk-to-yourself-in-Portuguese" class="headerlink" title="5. Talk to yourself in Portuguese"></a>5. Talk to yourself in Portuguese</h2><p> If you can’t find any online friends to help you<strong>practice Portuguese</strong> , you can even talk to yourself. Not by yourself, but to yourself. As crazy as that sounds, expressing your thoughts in Portuguese can help you master the language faster. If you prove to be persevering, you’ll soon discover that you will be able to form a line of thought directly into<strong>the Portuguese language.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/learn-portuguese-1024x682.jpg"                      alt="learn portuguese" title="The Best Way To Study Portuguese - 6 Tips That Will Work Wonders 3"                ></p><p> “Madeira, Portugal” by Adam Śmigielski©</p><h2 id="Bonus-tip-Stay-positive-and-book-your-trip-to-Brazil-or-Portugal-ASAP"><a href="#Bonus-tip-Stay-positive-and-book-your-trip-to-Brazil-or-Portugal-ASAP" class="headerlink" title="Bonus tip: Stay positive and book your trip to Brazil or Portugal ASAP"></a>Bonus tip: Stay positive and book your trip to Brazil or Portugal ASAP</h2><p> What language do you want to learn?<strong>Brazilian Portuguese</strong> or<strong>European Portuguese?</strong> Well, whatever your choice, go to momondo and book your holiday right now.
