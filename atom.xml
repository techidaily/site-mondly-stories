Forget about dry memorization techniques that lack context. <strong>The world’s best way to <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-6033&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6033?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ro&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-6033?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=ro" >learn Romanian is Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , an <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondly" >app made in Romania <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</strong> Featuring fun, easy and effective language courses designed by the natives for you, Mondly will help you speak Romanian from day 1.</p><p> You don’t even have to take my word for it. Have you heard about Dracula? Famous vampire, born and raised in Transylvania, Romania. How do you think he knows such perfect English? He learned it with Mondly, of course!</p><p> Kidding about the Dracula part, but Mondly can really help you learn up to 41 languages. Here’s more about how it can help you master Romanian.</p><h2 id="The-Romanian-language-—-Dracula’s-mother-tongue"><a href="#The-Romanian-language-—-Dracula’s-mother-tongue" class="headerlink" title="The Romanian language — Dracula’s mother tongue"></a>The Romanian language — Dracula’s mother tongue</h2><p> With over 23 million <a class="link"   href="https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ron" >speakers worldwide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Romanian language is the official and national language of Romania and Moldova and one of the official languages of the European Union. If you don’t know where to locate <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania" >Romania <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , think Central Eastern Europe. As already mentioned, Romania is also the home of the infamous Dracula, most commonly known by Romanians as <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad%5Fthe%5FImpaler" >Vlad the Impaler <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> One of the most surprising things about <strong>Romanian is the fact that it is a <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Romance language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,</strong> therefore related to Italian, Spanish, French and Portuguese. Entirely surrounded by Slavic-speaking countries, it’s still a mystery how Romanian and most of its Latin roots managed to prevail as a Romance <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >language in Eastern Europe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Slavic populations that passed through the territory at some point did not transform, but rather just influenced the Romanian language. That’s why there are some Romanian words that sound nothing like their Italian, Spanish or French counterparts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/romance-language.png"                      alt="romance language" title="Learn Romanian With The Award-Winning App Made By Romanians 2"                ></p><p> Romanian, the unusual Romance language.</p><p> Written using the Latin alphabet (plus five additional letters with diacritics), <strong>Romanian is fairly easy to read and speak because it is a phonetic language.</strong> This means that all the words are pronounced exactly as they are spelled. Awesome news if you want to learn Romanian fast! Besides, if you’re already familiar with one or more Romance languages, learning gets even easier. Here are some words and phrases that may look familiar:</p><table><thead><tr><th>English</th><th>Spanish</th><th>Italian</th><th>French</th><th>Roma- nian</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>good</td><td>bueno</td><td>buono</td><td>buono</td><td>bun</td></tr><tr><td>night</td><td>noche</td><td>notte</td><td>nuit</td><td>noapte</td></tr><tr><td>mother</td><td>madre</td><td>madre</td><td>mère</td><td>mamă</td></tr><tr><td>sky</td><td>cielo</td><td>cielo</td><td>ciel</td><td>cer</td></tr><tr><td>milk</td><td>leche</td><td>latte</td><td>lait</td><td>lapte</td></tr><tr><td>eye</td><td>ojo</td><td>occhio</td><td>oeil</td><td>ochi</td></tr><tr><td>rain</td><td>lluvia</td><td>pioggia</td><td>pluie</td><td>ploaie</td></tr><tr><td>house</td><td>casa</td><td>casa</td><td>maison</td><td>casă</td></tr><tr><td>five</td><td>cinco</td><td>cinque</td><td>cinq</td><td>cinci</td></tr></tbody></table><p> As you can see from these examples,<strong>Romanian is closest to Italian</strong> most of the time. So it’s no mere coincidence that the largest population of Romanian expats can be found in Italy.</p><p> When it comes to <a class="link"   href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Romanian-language" >grammar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> though, Romanian seems to be the odd one out. Due to its isolation from the other Latin languages, it developed in rather different directions. That is why its definite articles are enclitic (attached to the end of the noun) and not proclitic (in front of the noun). However, unlike other Latin languages, Romanian has stayed true to the Latin morphological case differentiation: nominative&#x2F;accusative, genitive&#x2F;dative, and vocative.</p><h2 id="Learn-Romanian-online-with-free-daily-lessons"><a href="#Learn-Romanian-online-with-free-daily-lessons" class="headerlink" title="Learn Romanian online with free daily lessons"></a>Learn Romanian online with free daily lessons</h2><p> Now that you know a thing or two about Romanian, it’s time to get down to business.

That’s why you have to take lessons from the best. And who would be the best at speaking Romanian if not Romanians themselves? Lucky for you, Mondly was created by a <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >team of Romanians <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in Transylvania.

Was it falling in love with a Romanian? The famous song ‘Dragostea din Tei’? Sebastian Stan? Dracula? Or maybe just a friend that told you about all the great parties in Bucharest?</p><p> No matter the reason, know this: you have yet to discover Romania’s full potential. If you are looking for a country where you can climb spectacular mountains, go to the seaside, eat good food and meet fascinating people, Romania should be on your list.

Master these and you are going to make a lot of friends in Romania.</p><ul><li><p>Hello! – Bună!</p></li><li><p>yes – da</p></li><li><p>no – nu</p></li><li><p>Thanks. – Mulțumesc.</p></li><li><p>I’m sorry. – Îmi pare rău.&#x2F;Scuze.</p></li><li><p>What’s your name? – Cum te cheamă?</p></li><li><p>I am… – Eu sunt…</p></li><li><p>How are you? – Ce mai faci?</p></li><li><p>Great! – Super!</p></li><li><p>Goodbye! – La revedere!

Although they don’t make a lot of sense, tongue twisters are very helpful in speech therapy due to their repeated sounds. For this reason, they are used by actors, politicians and even news anchors before going live. Essentially, a tongue twister works like a physical exercise: the more you practice, the better your pronunciation will be.</p><p> According to the <a class="link"   href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/tongue-twister" >Cambridge Dictionary <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a tongue twister is <strong>“a sentence or phrase that is intended to be difficult to say, especially when repeated quickly and often”</strong> .

Did you know that he raps with a whopping speed of 11.4 syllables per second in his song “Rap God”? We don’t know much about rap, but that sure sounds like something only the God of Rap could do.</p><p> But Eminem’s songs and long tongue twisters are challenging for those who are not ready for long runs. Are you? Can you defeat Eminem? Let’s find out. Take a deep breath and try saying the following tongue twister without stopping.</p><ol><li>All I want is a proper cup of coffee.<br> Made in a proper copper coffee pot.<br> You can believe it or not.<br> But I want a cup of coffee from a proper copper pot.<br> Tin coffee pots or iron coffee pots, they’re not good to me.<br> If I can’t have a proper cup of coffee from a proper copper coffee pot, I’ll just have tea.<br> All I want is a proper cup of coffee.<br> Made in a proper copper coffee pot.<br> You can believe it or not.<br> But I want a cup of coffee from a proper copper pot.</li><li>To sit in solemn silence in a dull, dark dock,<br> In a pestilential prison, with a life-long lock,<br> Awaiting the sensation of a short, sharp shock,<br> From a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block!<br> To sit in solemn silence in a dull, dark dock,<br> In a pestilential prison, with a life-long lock,<br> Awaiting the sensation of a short, sharp shock,<br> From a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block!<br> A dull, dark dock, a life-long lock,<br> A short, sharp shock, a big black block!<br> To sit in solemn silence in a pestilential prison,<br> And awaiting the sensation<br> From a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block!</li><li>Betty Botter bought some butter but, said she, the butter’s bitter.<br> If I put it in my batter, it will make my batter bitter.<br> But a bit of better butter will make my bitter batter better.<br> So she bought some better butter, better than the bitter butter,<br> put it in her bitter batter, made her bitter batter better.<br> So ‘t was better Betty Botter bought some better butter.</li><li>I’m a mother pheasant plucker, I pluck mother pheasants.<br> I’m the most pleasant mother pheasant plucker to ever pluck a mother pheasant.<br> I’m not the pheasant plucker I’m the pheasant plucker’s wife, I’ve been plucking Mother pheasants my whole pheasant plucking life.<br> I’m not the pheasant plucker I’m the pheasant plucker’s mate, I’m only plucking Pheasants ’cause the pheasant plucker’s late.</li><li>A tree-toad loved a she-toad<br> Who lived up in a tree.<br> He was a two-toed tree-toad,<br> But a three-toed toad was she.<br> The two-toed tree-toad tried to win<br> The three-toed she-toad’s heart,<br> For the two-toed tree-toad loved the ground<br> That the three-toed tree-toad trod.<br> But the two-toed tree-toad tried in vain;<br> He couldn’t please her whim.<br> From her tree-toad bower,<br> With her three-toed power,<br> The she-toad vetoed him.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/long-tongue-twisters-960x640.jpg"                      alt="&#39;Long tongue twisters&#39; by Mona Eendra©" title="100 Tongue Twisters To Perfect Pronunciation In English 3"                ></p><ol><li>Mr. See owned a saw.<br> And Mr. Soar owned a seesaw.<br> Now, See’s saw sawed Soar’s seesaw<br> Before Soar saw See,<br> Which made Soar sore.<br> Had Soar seen See’s saw<br> Before See sawed Soar’s seesaw,<br> See’s saw would not have sawed<br> Soar’s seesaw.<br> So See’s saw sawed Soar’s seesaw.<br> But it was sad to see Soar so sore<br> just because See’s saw sawed<br> Soar’s seesaw.</li><li>Ned Nott was shot and Sam Shott was not.<br> So it is better to be Shott than Nott.<br> Some say Nott was not shot.<br> But Shott says he shot Nott.<br> Either the shot Shott shot at Nott was not shot,<br> Or Nott was shot.<br> If the shot Shott shot shot Nott, Nott was shot.<br> But if the shot Shott shot shot Shott,<br> Then Shott was shot, not Nott.<br> However, the shot Shott shot shot not Shott, but Nott.</li><li>Theophilus Thistle, the Thistle Sifter,<br> Sifted a sieve of unsifted thistles.<br> If Theophilus Thistle, the Thistle Sifter,<br> Sifted a sieve of unsifted thistles,<br> Where is the sieve of un-sifted thistles<br> Theophilus Thistle, the Thistle Sifter, sifted?</li><li>A flea and a fly in a flue<br> Said the fly “Oh what should we do”<br> Said the flea” Let us fly<br> Said the fly “Let us flee”<br> So they flew through a flaw in the flue.</li><li>Of all the felt I ever felt,<br> I never felt a piece of felt<br> which felt as fine as that felt felt,<br> when first I felt that felt hat’s felt.</li></ol><h2 id="Hard-tongue-twisters"><a href="#Hard-tongue-twisters" class="headerlink" title="Hard tongue twisters"></a><strong>Hard tongue twisters</strong></h2><p> While we’re at it, we can help but wonder what the<strong>hardest tongue twister</strong> in existence is. Contrary to popular belief, it’s not supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.</p><p> At one point, <strong>“the sixth sick sheikh’s sixth sheep’s sick” held the Guinness World Record for the hardest twister,</strong> but since the category no longer exists, the title was probably revoked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hard-tongue-twisters-960x640.jpg"                      alt="&#39;Hard tongue twisters&#39; by Daniel Sandoval©" title="100 Tongue Twisters To Perfect Pronunciation In English 4"                ></p><p> Don’t worry though! We are not running out of options. In 2013, MIT‌ researchers concluded that <strong>“pad kid poured curd pulled cod” is the hardest tongue twister in the world.</strong> In fact, Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, an MIT psychologist, says you will get a prize if you manage to say that 10 times quickly. And not any kind of “quickly”. We’re talking super-sonic-Eminem-quickly!</p><ol><li>Pad kid poured curd pulled cod.</li><li>If you must cross a course cross cow across a crowded cow crossing, cross the cross coarse cow across the crowded cow crossing carefully.</li><li>Brisk brave brigadiers brandished broad bright blades, blunderbusses, and bludgeons — balancing them badly.</li><li>Six sick hicks nick six slick bricks with picks and sticks.</li><li>Can you can a canned can into an un-canned can like a canner can can a canned can into an un-canned can?</li><li>The sixth sick sheikh’s sixth sheep’s sick.</li><li>Rory the warrior and Roger the worrier were reared wrongly in a rural brewery.</li><li>Ingenious iguanas improvising an intricate impromptu on impossibly-impractical instruments.</li><li>I saw Susie sitting in a shoe shine shop<br> Where she shines, she sits, and where she sits, she shines.</li><li>When a doctor doctors a doctor, does the doctor doing the doctoring doctor as the doctor being doctored wants to be doctored or does the doctor doing the doctoring doctor as he wants to doctor?</li><li>These thousand tricky tongue twisters trip thrillingly off the tongue.</li><li>Thirty-three thirsty, thundering thoroughbreds thumped Mr. Thurber on Thursday.</li><li>Brisk brave brigadiers brandished broad bright blades, blunderbusses, and bludgeons—balancing them badly.</li><li>A skunk sat on a stump and thunk the stump stunk, but the stump thunk the skunk stunk.</li><li>Give papa a cup of proper coffee in a copper coffee cup.</li><li>He threw three free throws.</li><li>Near an ear, a nearer ear, a nearly eerie ear.</li><li>Many an anemone sees an enemy anemone.</li><li>Chop shops stock chops.</li></ol><h2 id="Tongue-twisters-for-kids"><a href="#Tongue-twisters-for-kids" class="headerlink" title="Tongue twisters for kids"></a><strong>Tongue twisters for kids</strong></h2><p> Tongue twisters for kids are all sweet, fun, and games until you increase the speed.

They may not have followed the “blockbuster” recipe, they may not have won a lot of prizes, but they sure did win the hearts of millions of movie geeks around the world.</p><p> Now, believe it or not, if you want to learn Danish or you already are in the process of it, watching Danish films can get you closer to your goal. <strong>Watching films in the language you want to learn helps your brain understand that this is not something you do because you have to, but because it’s fun and you genuinely enjoy it.</strong> Your brain will associate an activity you enjoy – watching films – with the language you want to learn – Danish – and it will open up like a flower making information retention much easier.</p><p> So if you want to train your ears for the Danish language and indulge yourself with some high-quality cinema, watching these six Danish films is the best way to enjoy a lazy weekend while also being productive.</p><p>Grab the popcorn and enjoy!</p><h2 id="6-Der-kommer-en-dag-2016-The-Day-Will-Come"><a href="#6-Der-kommer-en-dag-2016-The-Day-Will-Come" class="headerlink" title="6. Der kommer en dag (2016) (The Day Will Come)"></a>6. Der kommer en dag (2016) (The Day Will Come)</h2><p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4659056/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1"><strong>IMDb rating: 7,8</strong></a></p><p> Inspired by true events, the first movie on our list is not for the tender-hearted. The year is 1967 and two inseparable brothers, Elmer and Erik – are taken from their dying mother and put in the Gudbjerg Home for Boys, a real-life children’s home that still exists today in Denmark. Google “Godhavn Boys’ Home” to find out the whole story behind it (if you haven’t heard about it already).</p><p> The events that follow are distressing – to say the least. The boys discover very quickly that Gudbjerg is run by Heck (Lars Mikkelsen), a cruel headmaster who is sacredly devoted to both physical and mental punishments as a way of instilling discipline in children. From public humiliation to hard physical labor – the boys from Gudbjerg are subject to every punishment possible in order to later become obedient citizens.</p><p> Elmer and Erik try to become “invisible”, but that doesn’t spare them from being bullied by some of the older boys. Are they gonna find salvation? Watch it and find out.</p><h2 id="5-Adams-AEbler-2005-Adam’s-Apples"><a href="#5-Adams-AEbler-2005-Adam’s-Apples" class="headerlink" title="5. Adams Æbler (2005) (Adam’s Apples)"></a>5. Adams Æbler (2005) (Adam’s Apples)</h2><p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418455/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1"><strong>IMDb rating: 7,8</strong></a></p><p> Before becoming Le Chiffre, Hannibal, and Kaecilius, Mads Mikkelsen was kept secret by the Danes in all these great indie films that only diehard knew about. “Adams Æbler”, a film about a neo-nazi sentenced to community service at a church, is one of them.</p><p> In this one, Mikkelsen plays the role of an eternally optimistic priest who sees the world through rose-colored glasses and is happy to take on the new task of helping Adam, a psychotic neo-Nazi, to complete his rehabilitation. In order to move forward with his goal, Adam must select a task, so he decides to bake an apple pie as a way of mocking the priest. Little did he know how difficult baking the pie will actually become…</p><p> “Adams Æbler” is a successful combination of black humor and drama guaranteed to keep you glued to the screen.</p><h2 id="4-Efter-brylluppet-2006-After-the-Wedding"><a href="#4-Efter-brylluppet-2006-After-the-Wedding" class="headerlink" title="4. Efter brylluppet (2006) (After the Wedding)"></a>4. Efter brylluppet (2006) (After the Wedding)</h2><p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457655/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1"><strong>IMDb rating: 7,7</strong></a></p><p> Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year in 2007 (lost the race to the German masterpiece “Das Leben der Anderen”), “Efter brylluppet” tells the story of Jacob, the manager of an Indian orphanage that faces bankruptcy. With very few people to help him, Jacob works hard to keep the orphanage afloat, but fate doesn’t seem to favor him.</p><p> Luckily, before long, Jacob receives an interesting offer: a businessman will donate $4 million for the orphanage with one condition: to attend his daughter’s wedding in Denmark. Jacob accepts the deal, but soon discovers that the event will change both his future and past forever. How? You’ll have to find out for yourself.</p><p> This is only the second movie in the list blessed with the presence of Mads Mikkelsen, but hang in there! There’s more on the way.</p><h2 id="3-Haevnen-2010-In-a-Better-World"><a href="#3-Haevnen-2010-In-a-Better-World" class="headerlink" title="3. Hævnen (2010) (In a Better World)"></a>3. Hævnen (2010) (In a Better World)</h2><p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1340107/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1"><strong>IMDb rating: 7,6</strong></a></p><p> Anton, a Danish doctor who commutes between his home in Denmark and an <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >African <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> refugee camp, is separated from his wife with whom he has two young sons. Their older son, Elias, is bullied at school until Christian, the new boy in town, comes to his rescue by threatening the bully with a knife. Both Christian and Elias lie about the incident to the police and their parents.</p><p> Elias and Christian quickly form a strong bond, but when Christian involves Elias in a dangerous act of revenge, their lives are put in danger and their friendship is tested.</p><p> Academy Award winner for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year in 2011 (already convinced, aren’t you?), “Hævnen” is a story about friendship, choices, revenge, forgiveness and the consequences of our actions. There’s no way you won’t find yourself in it.</p><h2 id="2-En-kongelig-affaere-2012-A-Royal-Affair"><a href="#2-En-kongelig-affaere-2012-A-Royal-Affair" class="headerlink" title="2. En kongelig affære (2012) (A Royal Affair)"></a>2. En kongelig affære (2012) (A Royal Affair)</h2><p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1276419/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"><strong>IMDb rating: 7,5</strong></a></p><p> I always like to save the best for the last, so here are two of my favorite films of all time: “En kongelig affære” and “Jagten”. Both incredible, both featuring Mads Mikkelsen.</p><p> One of the best films of Alicia Vikander since before she became a huge Hollywood sensation, “En kongelig affære” is about the young British Princess Caroline who is married to the mad King Christian VII of Denmark. As you may expect, Caroline’s life is far for happy so she soon finds love and comfort in Dr. Johann Struensee’s arms, her husband’s companion and a man of the Enlightenment.</p><p> The two lovers use their influence on King Christian to start a revolution that will change the nation forever. But will this be in their own best interest? Believe me, you absolutely have to watch this. Not only that this film was also nominated for an Oscar, but the costume design and the acting are absolutely amazing. Time watching it will not be time wasted.</p><h2 id="1-Jagten-2012-The-Hunt"><a href="#1-Jagten-2012-The-Hunt" class="headerlink" title="1. Jagten (2012) (The Hunt)"></a>1. Jagten (2012) (The Hunt)</h2><p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2106476/"><strong>IMDb rating: 8,3</strong></a></p><p> “Jagten” was nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe in 2014. Unfortunately, it lost them both to an equally magnificent piece of work: “La grande bellezza” by Italian genius filmmaker Paolo Sorrentino.</p><p> The film tells the story of Lucas, a kindergarten teacher who lives a lonely existence while also struggling over his son’s custody. His life slowly seems to get better when he finds love and receives good news from his teenage son. However, his happiness is about to be brutally shattered by an innocent little lie one of his students tells about him. And thus the hunt begins. Before Lucas can understand the consequences, he becomes the outcast of the town.</p><p>“Jagten” is sublime, absolutely heart-wrenching and it will remain imprinted in your mind and soul forever. Get ready for an avalanche of feelings with this one!</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/the-6-best-danish-films-to-learn-danish/&t=The+6+Best+Danish+Films+to+Learn+Danish"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h4 id="Speak-Danish-fluently-in-just-10-minutes-a-day"><a href="#Speak-Danish-fluently-in-just-10-minutes-a-day" class="headerlink" title="Speak Danish fluently in just 10 minutes a day"></a>Speak Danish fluently in just 10 minutes a day</h4><p> Do you want to speak Danish fluently fast?

The acquisition will allow Pearson to offer a full range of ways for people to learn and prove their English skills – adding online self-study to its existing diagnosis and learning tools and assessment portfolio.</p><p> Mondly is one of the world’s leading online language learning players, offering consumers high quality learning in English and 40 other languages via its app, website, virtual reality and augmented reality products. Mondly delivers language courses for both professional and personal learning in a combination of more than 1300 language pairs and is consistently ranked as one of the highest rated educational language apps in the app store. It also offers enterprise solutions through MondlyWORKS and has built an award-winning app that helps children learn languages – MondlyKIDS.</p><p> “Today’s acquisition marks another step in our digital strategy, giving us an exciting foothold in the fast growing direct-to-consumer English learning market and building yet more connectivity across the entire Pearson portfolio,” said Andy Bird, chief executive of Pearson.</p><p> “Mondly is a fast growing and profitable business that expands our reach and scale in the language learning market and drives growth for the company. This acquisition is strategically important to the Group as well as being accretive and driving shareholder returns.”</p><p> “Mondly’s mission has always been to make language learning fun, easy and accessible to everyone. We are excited to be joining forces with Pearson, the world’s leading learning company, to help us achieve our goal on a much larger scale. Together we will work to shape the future of learning languages, ” said Alex Iliescu, CEO and co-founder of Mondly.</p><p> Pearson expects this acquisition to accelerate revenue growth from 2023 onwards for our English Language Learning division and continues to expect mid-teens margins for the division by 2025.</p><p> The acquisition enables the company to offer a fully integrated market proposition. It also provides synergies and cross-selling opportunities across the portfolio, such as offering the opportunity to bundle English with upskilling and reskilling products through Pearson’s Workforce Skills division. The Mondly team, including the founders, will join Pearson’s English Language Learning division.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/mondly-joins-pearson/&t=Mondly+Joins+Pearson"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="About-Pearson"><a href="#About-Pearson" class="headerlink" title="About Pearson"></a><strong>About Pearson</strong></h2><p> At Pearson, our purpose is simple: to add life to a lifetime of learning.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Dive-Into-Japanese-Greeting-Culture"><a href="#Dive-Into-Japanese-Greeting-Culture" class="headerlink" title="Dive Into Japanese Greeting Culture"></a>Dive Into Japanese Greeting Culture</h2><p> Japanese culture is the culture of respect. You don’t have to visit Japan to know that. We all heard about the famously polite<strong>Japanese bow</strong> and about the big emphasis Japanese people place on the respect of hierarchy in the family and etiquette in general. It’s in their DNA. And the same as its culture, the<strong>Japanese language</strong> is one of the most polite languages in the world. It’s true that, as a tourist, you don’t have to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn Japanese <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to perfection, but you know what they say: when in Rome, do as the Romans do and you will certainly increase the enjoyment of your adventure.</p><p> Learning as much as a simple <strong><em>Konnichiwa</em> (“hello” in Japanese)</strong> or <strong><em>Arigato</em> (“thank you” in Japanese)</strong> can work wonders. So here’s a guide to all the<strong>Japanese greetings</strong> you’ll need in your Japanese adventure: from<strong>“hello” in Japanese</strong> to**<em>Moshi Moshi</em>** (used to say “hello” on the phone), goodbye and other<strong>common Japanese greetings.</strong></p><h2 id="1-“Hello”-in-Japanese"><a href="#1-“Hello”-in-Japanese" class="headerlink" title="1. “Hello” in Japanese"></a>1. “Hello” in Japanese</h2><p> If you ever watched at least one anime series, you probably already know this: <strong>“hello” in Japanese is_Konnichiwa_ .</strong> Rings any bell? It most probably does since**<em>Konnichiwa</em>** is undeniably the most<strong>common Japanese greeting.</strong> Thanks to some of the most influential anime of all time such as Dragon Ball Z, Death Note, and Naruto, a lot of people living outside Japan know at least a few <a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875"><strong>words in Japanese</strong></a> and_Konnichiwa_ is definitely one of them.</p><p> But back in the day, when Japanese people met, they would address each other with_konnichi wa gokiken ikaga desu ka?_ (“wow are you feeling today?”),<em>konnichi wa ii hi desu ne</em> (“today is a nice day”) or_kon’nichi wa ikaga desu ka_ (“how is today?”). Over time, these expressions became shorter and shorter until they ultimately transformed to the**<em>Konnichiwa</em>** we all use today to greet each other in Japanese.</p><p> Also, keep in mind that it’s usually only used during the daytime, between morning and evening.</p><p> When it comes to using it in various social contexts, you should know that**<em>Konnichiwa</em>** can be used safely in all kinds of situations (only between morning and evening; never early in the morning or late at night) except for those involving very close friends. It could be a little awkward to use**<em>Konnichiwa</em>** (こんにちは) when meeting your Japanese friends. In this situation, it’s better to use something a lot more informal than that, like:</p><ul><li><em>ossu</em> – used exclusively between male friends and relatives around the same age. It’s similar to “hey dude” or “hey man” in English</li><li><em>yaho</em> – extremely informal, typically used by girls (boys more often say_yo_) but suitable for all the young people</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/honnichiwa-1024x683.jpg"                      alt="honnichiwa" title="Hello In Japanese - All The Japanese Greetings You Need To Know 2"                ></p><p> “Kyoto, Japan” by Sorasak©</p><p> If you have to write<strong>“hello” in Japanese,</strong> there are two ways to do it (three if you also count in Romaji – the romanization of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Japanese writing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> system):</p><p> -using<strong>Kanji symbols:</strong> 今日は</p><p> – using<strong>Hiragana symbols:</strong> こんにちは</p><p> Curious about why there are multiple types of characters in Japanese?

Good morning in Japanese and other relevant greetings"></a>2. Good morning in Japanese and other relevant greetings</h2><p><strong>Good morning in Japanese</strong>   <strong>– O_hayō gozaimasu_</strong>  (おはよう ございます) is the best choice for greeting someone in the early morning hours (before 10:00 a.m.). Unlike_Konnichiwa_ ,   <strong>O_hayō gozaimasu_</strong>  a little more formal, so it’s safe to use it with people you don’t know or when you are meeting people in a position of authority (such as your boss or your teacher).</p><p>This greeting is used both as a “hello” and as a “goodbye”.</p><p><strong>Good evening in Japanese</strong>   <strong>– K_onbanwa_</strong>  (こんばんは) – is how you should greet people in the late afternoon or evening hours. The same as_Ohayō gozaimasu_ , <strong>K_onbanwa_</strong>  can be used both as a “hello” and as a “goodbye”.</p><p> If you are leaving, you can also say_Oyasumi nasai_ (おやすみなさい) to say “goodbye” in Japanese at night. But only when you leave as this Japanese phrase is not typically used as a greeting.</p><p><strong>Good night in Japanese</strong>   <strong>–<em>Oyasuminasai</em></strong>  (おやすみなさい) – is how you greet someone in Japanese if you are leaving at night. This Japanese phrase is not typically used as a greeting, so don’t forget you can’t use it when you meet someone.</p><p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Morning and evening are more carefully delimited in the Japanese culture than in the West. So it’s important to know your**<em>Konnichiwa</em>** and never use it instead of**<em>Konbanwa</em>** or**<em>Oyasuminasai.</em>**</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hi-in-japanese-960x639.jpg"                      alt="hi in Japanese" title="Hello In Japanese - All The Japanese Greetings You Need To Know 3"                ></p><p> “Meguro River, Matsuno, Japan” by Sora Sagano©</p><h2 id="3-“Goodbye”-in-Japanese"><a href="#3-“Goodbye”-in-Japanese" class="headerlink" title="3.“Goodbye” in Japanese"></a>3.“Goodbye” in Japanese</h2><p> Another greeting we borrowed from the Japanese and sometimes use in our day-to-day conversations in English is**<em>Sayōnara</em>** (さよなら), a greeting that carries the connotation of farewell and translates to “goodbye”.</p><p><strong><em>Sayōnara</em></strong> derived from_Sayō naraba_ (“If that’s the way it is”), a phrase that was originally used by people before leaving in a way that would sum up a conversation. Nowadays,<em>Sayōnara</em>  is a semi-formal way to say<strong>“goodbye” in Japanese.</strong></p><p> Although notorious abroad, Japanese people don’t really use_<strong>Sayonara.</strong>_ For informal situations that involve close friends, they prefer using**<em>bai bai</em>** (ばいばい), which translates to – you guessed it – “bye bye” in English,<em>jaa ne</em> (じゃあね) which translates to “see you” or_saraba da_ (さらばだ) which is the equivalent of “adios!”.</p><p> Want more? Here are other ways to say goodbye in Japanese that are suitable for both formal and informal situations:</p><ul><li>I’ll see you later. – <em>Mata aimashou.</em>  (また会いましょう。)</li><li>Take care! – <em>Ki wo tsukete!</em>  (きをつけて！)</li><li>See you tomorrow! – M_ata ashita!_  (またあした！)</li><li>See you soon! – <em>Mata ne!</em>  (またね！)</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/goodbye-in-japanese-1024x683.jpg"                      alt="goodbye in Japanese" title="Hello In Japanese - All The Japanese Greetings You Need To Know 4"                ></p><p> “See you soon, human” by Alain Pham©</p><h2 id="4-“Thank-you”-in-Japanese-and-other-polite-phrases-that-you-should-know"><a href="#4-“Thank-you”-in-Japanese-and-other-polite-phrases-that-you-should-know" class="headerlink" title="4. “Thank you” in Japanese and other polite phrases that you should know"></a>4. “Thank you” in Japanese and other polite phrases that you should know</h2><p> We already settled that the Japanese culture is a culture of respect and politeness. Thus, learning to say<strong>“thank you” in Japanese</strong> is probably one of your most important tasks to complete before visiting Japan. Lucky for you, there’s nothing difficult about that.</p><p> The most casual and common way to say<strong>“thank you” in Japanese</strong> to your family and friends is**<em>Arigatou</em>** (ありがとう). Not “Arigato”. That’s actually a very common misconception about how to write “thank you” in Romaji.</p><p> Japanese people use**<em>Arigatou</em>** the same way we use<strong>“thanks”</strong> , but they also have an even shorter way to express their gratitude within a group of friends:<em>Domo</em> (どうも).<em>Domo</em> translates to “very much”.</p><p> Moving to a slightly formal form,<strong><em>Domo arigatou</em></strong> (どうもありがとう) is the equivalent of<strong>“thank you”.</strong> Careful though! This is not formal enough to be used with someone who is in a position of authority over you.</p><p> If you need a more formal way of<strong>thanking someone in Japanese,</strong> you should use one of these expressions:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Arigatou gozaimasu</em></strong> (ありがとうございます) – thank you very much</li><li><strong><em>Domo arigatou gozaimasu</em></strong> (どうもございまずいます) – an even more polite form for “thank you very much”</li><li><strong><em>Arigatou gozaimashita</em></strong> – suitable for when you want to thank someone for something that he or she did in the recent past</li><li><strong><em>Gochisou sama deshita</em></strong> – use this phrase if you want to thank for your meal. Furthermore, if you want to say that the meal is delicious, you say_Sore wa oishī desu_ (それはおいしいです) – “that’s delicious”.</li></ul><p> If you want to continue the conversation and reply to someone thanking you, you can use these <strong><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Japanese phrases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> :</strong></p><ul><li><em>Dou itashi mashite</em> (どういたしまして) – translates to “you’re welcome”</li><li><em>Iie</em> (いいえ) – instead of_Dou itashi mashite,_ you can say_Iie,_ which means “no” as in “it was nothing”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/arigato-1024x706.jpg"                      alt="arigato" title="Hello In Japanese - All The Japanese Greetings You Need To Know 5"                ></p><p> “Kyoto, Japan” by Andre Benz©</p><h2 id="Don’t-forget-about-the-Japanese-bow"><a href="#Don’t-forget-about-the-Japanese-bow" class="headerlink" title="Don’t forget about the Japanese bow"></a>Don’t forget about the Japanese bow</h2><p> Every<strong>“hello” in Japanese</strong> is usually accompanied by a bow, the Western world equivalent of a handshake. Our advice would be to not skip the bow if you really want to feel like you belong.</p><p><strong>The Japanese bow</strong> is an essential part of the culture of respect and <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette%5Fin%5FJapan" >etiquette <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in Japan. When you meet someone, you say**<em>Konnichiwa</em>** and you bow as a sign of respect. If you receive a bow, you immediately bow back. A simple but powerful gesture that perfectly embodies the beauty of the Japanese culture.</p><p> So here are the main things you should know about the<strong>Japanese bow:</strong></p><p> – bowing lower is a sign of respect. Thus, you should always bow lower to people you don’t know or to people in a position of authority;</p><p>– 15-degree bows are for people that you are familiar with;</p><p> – 30-degree bows are for people you just met or are of a higher social status than you;</p><p> – 45-degree bows are used for greetings only if you meet a very important person like the Emperor or the Prime Minister.</p><h2 id="Bonus-basic-conversation-in-Japanese"><a href="#Bonus-basic-conversation-in-Japanese" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: basic conversation in Japanese"></a>Bonus: basic conversation in Japanese</h2><p> If you don’t want to stop at just<strong>“thank you” or “hello” in Japanese,</strong> here are a few more<strong>Japanese phrases</strong> that are fairly easy to remember and will definitely make all the difference for your trip to Japan:</p><ul><li>Hello! How nice it is to see you! –<em>Konnichiwa! Anata ni futatabi aete ureshī desu.</em></li><li>How are you? – <em>Genki?</em></li><li>Fine, thanks. And you? – <em>Genki desu, arigatō.

If you are motivated by having competition, do all the lessons and let the points decide your place in the national and international leaderboards.</p><h2 id="Why-are-they-called-“free-daily-lessons”"><a href="#Why-are-they-called-“free-daily-lessons”" class="headerlink" title="Why are they called “free daily lessons”?"></a>Why are they called “free daily lessons”?</h2><p> Each daily lesson is only free for one day: the day it becomes available inside the app. After that, it becomes accessible only with a Mondly premium account.</p><h2 id="Why-Mondly"><a href="#Why-Mondly" class="headerlink" title="Why Mondly?"></a>Why Mondly?</h2><p> With over 40 million downloads worldwide and an average rating of 4.7 out of 5 from over 1,000,000 reviews, Mondly is one of the most innovative language learning platforms in the world.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Early-Language-Ladders-From-Nursery-School-To-Elementary"><a href="#Early-Language-Ladders-From-Nursery-School-To-Elementary" class="headerlink" title="Early Language Ladders: From Nursery School To Elementary"></a>Early Language Ladders: From Nursery School To Elementary</h2><p> In today’s globalized world,<strong>Spanish for kids</strong> stands out as an invaluable learning opportunity. Recognizing the value of bilingualism, it’s vital to tap into the receptiveness of your children’s young minds and introduce them to Spanish while it’s still very easy to learn. Encouraging them to start learning Spanish for kids now will equip them with a skill they can use and appreciate throughout their lives as they mature into global citizens.</p><p> The goal is to instill a lasting love for this Romance language and make learning Spanish a fascinating adventure! So, let’s discover what are the best resources to help kids learn Spanish fast. Whether you’re thinking Spanish songs, books, or cartoons – they’re all included in this comprehensive guide.</p><h2 id="Introduction-to-Spanish-for-Kids"><a href="#Introduction-to-Spanish-for-Kids" class="headerlink" title="Introduction to Spanish for Kids"></a>Introduction to Spanish for Kids</h2><p> Teaching the little ones anything – from dinosaur names to Spanish for kids – is extremely simple if you know what methods to use. There are no ‘lazy’ children that ‘won’t study’. Only busy adults. If you give them your time and knowledge, kids’ minds will almost literally absorb all kinds of information, from languages to poetry or basic math, in no time.</p><p> How? Well, their brains have a less developed prefrontal cortex. Thus, they tend to use their imagination much more than us. While adults experience functional fixedness and see everything exactly as it is, <strong>children create unexpected connections to help them learn faster.</strong> Obviously, the difficulty level is different. So adults shouldn’t blame their ‘old’ and ‘dusty’ minds for not retaining information but for their lack of imagination.</p><p> Meanwhile, children have no problem associating new words with seemingly unrelated notions they already know. For example, my 4-year-old nephew associates the word_aburrido_ (‘bored’) with_burro_ (‘donkey’) – a Spanish word he already knew. The connection is Eeyore, the iconic donkey from Winnie the Pooh.

At first glance, anyone would be tempted to claim that Turkish and Korean are worlds apart. Both literally and figuratively. However, despite their geographical distance and distinct cultural heritages, these two nations share some<strong>intriguing points of intersection.</strong> Could two languages coming from different language families be related?</p><p> Their potential connection has perplexed linguists and historians alike for many years. So, let’s see what this is all about and how two apparently different languages echo each other in syntax, structure, and soul.</p><h2 id="Historical-Roots-and-Origins-of-Turkish-and-Korean"><a href="#Historical-Roots-and-Origins-of-Turkish-and-Korean" class="headerlink" title="Historical Roots and Origins of Turkish and Korean"></a>Historical Roots and Origins of Turkish and Korean</h2><p> Before exploring the intriguing points of intersection between Turkish and Korean, it’s important to look back at their historical roots.</p><h3 id="The-Turkish-Language"><a href="#The-Turkish-Language" class="headerlink" title="The Turkish Language"></a>The Turkish Language</h3><p> The Turkish language (or “Türkçe” – as the Turkish people would say) is the most widely spoken Turkic language, with around 100 million native speakers worldwide. Turkish is a part of the Oghuz branch of the Turkic language family, along with Azerbaijani, Turkmen, and Qashqai.</p><p> The earliest proof of Turkish is the Orkhon script found in modern Mongolia. Erected in honor of a prince and his emperor brother, these inscriptions date back to the Turkic tribes in the 7th century CE. When these tribes began to move westward, their interactions with diverse people and cultures – including Mongols and Persians, shaped Turkish into a new language.</p><p> The process continued during the Selijuk and the Ottoman periods when Turkish became infused with a plethora of Persian and Arabic words, giving rise to Ottoman Turkish.</p><p> In the 20th century, though, a linguistic revolution followed when <strong>Mustafa Kemal Atatürk replaced the Arabic script with the Latin alphabet,</strong> aiming to modernize and simplify Turkish. This strategic move not only transformed the language but also contributed to a cultural renaissance.</p><p> Discovering more about the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >modern Turkish alphabet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will help you understand its importance.</p><h3 id="The-Korean-Language"><a href="#The-Korean-Language" class="headerlink" title="The Korean Language"></a>The Korean Language</h3><p> Unlike Turkish, Korean’s roots are more enigmatic. That means we don’t know much about its ancient history. However, we can say the language started its long road to becoming the Korean language we know today in ancient times, under the rule of the Three Kingdoms of Korea: Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla.</p><p> Later, the evolution of the Korean language was significantly influenced by historical interactions with neighboring China and Japan. During the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties, Chinese characters were integrated into the Korean writing system, adding multiple layers of complexity to its structure and vocabulary.</p><p> However, the same as Turkish, Korean had a pivotal moment in its development that changed everything for the future of the language. In the 15th century, to help more common people become literate, <strong>King Sejong the Great commissioned the creation of <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Hangul, the new Korean alphabet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</strong> Although it was met with opposition, the new alphabet led over time to increased literacy rates and a cohesive national linguistic identity.</p><p> In modern times, K-pop and K-dramas from South Korea have further disseminated the Korean language and culture worldwide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/McOXfLCpYA6mAQkKDj/giphy-downsized-large.gif"                      alt="k-pop" title="Unveiling The Intriguing Relationship Between Turkish And Korean Languages 2"                ></p><h2 id="The-Controversial-Altaic-Language-Family"><a href="#The-Controversial-Altaic-Language-Family" class="headerlink" title="The Controversial Altaic Language Family"></a>The Controversial Altaic Language Family</h2><p> The major point of intersection between Turkish and Korean is what some linguists call the Altaic language family. But why is it controversial?</p><p> While Korean is a member of the Koreanic family and Turkish is a member of the Turkic family, some linguists believe that these families are, in turn, part of a greater family called <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altaic%5Flanguages" >Altaic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The controversial language family is also said to include the Mongolic, Tungusic and Japonic language families.</p><p><strong>The Altaic language family</strong> was initially introduced in the 18th century and gained widespread acceptance until the 1960s. Despite its demise, many encyclopedias and handbooks still include Altaic and references to it persist in modern sources through these older works. However, starting in the 1950s, most comparative linguists have discredited the Altaic proposal. This rejection stemmed from the discovery that supposed cognates were not valid, hypothesized sound shifts could not be substantiated, and Turkic and Mongolic languages were observed to be converging rather than diverging over time (which would not be the case with sister languages).</p><p> Presently, the consensus is that the relationship between Altaic languages is better explained by a_sprachbund_ , indicating linguistic similarities due to prolonged contact rather than a shared ancestry.</p><p> As you may have guessed, a_sprachbund_ is a group of languages that share areal features resulting from geographical proximity and language contact.</p><p> However, you should know that the Altaic hypothesis still has a small degree of support from individual linguists. That’s why it is considered controversial.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/themes/mondly/img/mondly-banner-icon.png"                      alt="mondly banner icon" title="Unveiling The Intriguing Relationship Between Turkish And Korean Languages 3"                ></p><h5 id="Learn-both-Turkish-and-Korean-with-a-single-app"><a href="#Learn-both-Turkish-and-Korean-with-a-single-app" class="headerlink" title="Learn both Turkish and Korean with a single app?"></a>Learn both Turkish and Korean with a single app?</h5><p> Yes, please!

When you get to discover how similar these two languages actually are, you begin to understand why some experts strongly believe there’s a potential historical connection between them. (And you probably start to believe in it yourself.)</p><p> But before listing all the similarities between Turkish and Korean, I want to tell you a personal story about their connection. My friend’s mother is Turkish and about a year or so, she started watching K-dramas, although<strong>she doesn’t speak a word of Korean.</strong> However, being a very modern and young mom, it’s not surprising. As you’ll see later in the article, Korean television dramas are very popular in Turkey.</p><p> So, she watches K-dramas on Netflix in their original Korean with subtitles. The thing is – and you’re not gonna believe this – she claims to understand some of the Korean words and phrases used in the dialogue that – she says – are similar to Turkish. The thing is the woman speaks not a word of Korean. Isn’t this crazy? Aren’t Turkish and Korean supposed to be two completely different languages with completely different alphabets?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3owzW9z4FkO6WzGIBW/giphy.gif"                      alt="k-drama" title="Unveiling The Intriguing Relationship Between Turkish And Korean Languages 4"                ></p><p> Well, as it turns out, that’s not entirely true.<strong>Turkish and Korean share a lot of similarities:</strong></p><ul><li>both employ agglutination, adding affixes to base words to change meaning and grammatical function;</li><li>both follow a subject-object-verb (SOV) sentence structure (relatively uncommon in other languages);</li><li>both follow the same syntax alignment for nouns and adjectives;</li><li>both exhibit post-positional particles;</li><li>both have modifiers that always precede modified words;</li><li>both have the close back unrounded vowel (ɯ) (a striking similarity, considering it is relatively rare in the broader spectrum of languages);</li><li>both feature a significant distinction between formal and informal language.</li></ul><p> Moreover, Turkish and Korean seem to share a good deal of vocabulary. Many people identified words that appear to have a common root, possibly related to a common ancestor.</p><p>Do you see now why some people still support the Altaic theory?</p><h2 id="Cultural-Exchange-and-Influence-between-Turkey-and-Korea"><a href="#Cultural-Exchange-and-Influence-between-Turkey-and-Korea" class="headerlink" title="Cultural Exchange and Influence between Turkey and Korea"></a>Cultural Exchange and Influence between Turkey and Korea</h2><p> To our knowledge, historical interactions between Turkey and Korea began during the Korean War (1950–1953), when Turkey sent troops to aid South Korea.</p><p> This act of solidarity laid the foundation for cultural exchanges, fostering mutual respect and appreciation that have grown over the years.</p><p> Nevertheless, it was not until later that the young generations in Turkey developed a passion for Korean culture (and vice-versa, more recently).</p><h3 id="Korean-Pop-Culture-in-Turkish-Society"><a href="#Korean-Pop-Culture-in-Turkish-Society" class="headerlink" title="Korean Pop Culture in Turkish Society"></a>Korean Pop Culture in Turkish Society</h3><p> Both Turkish and Korean enjoy an increasing worldwide popularity thanks to their TV series. Because yes, Turkish TV series have started to take the world by storm in the last couple of years.</p><p> However, Korean pop culture, widely known as the<strong>Hallyu wave,</strong> was the one that swept across the world with a significant impact in Turkey. The influence is evident in various aspects, including music, television, fashion &amp; beauty, language, and food. For example, Turkish remakes of popular Korean dramas and movies are now very popular in Turkey.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://blog.twitter.com/en%5Fus/topics/insights/2022/-kpoptwitter-reaches-new-heights-with-7-8-billion-global-tweets" >According to X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (formerly Twitter), Turkey is in the top 20 countries tweeting most about K-pop. If that doesn’t say something, I don’t know what will.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kpop-in-turkey-960x540.jpg"                      alt="K-pop in Turkey" title="Unveiling The Intriguing Relationship Between Turkish And Korean Languages 5"                ></p><p> The young generations in Turkey are such big fans of Hallyu that, in 2021, three girls fled their home in Istanbul to go to South Korea. Their action resulted in an investigation started by the Ministry of Family and Social Affairs in Turkey on the influence of K-pop and K-drama on Turkish youth.</p><p> Due to conservative Turkish families and the fact that in K-drama, males and females seem to be more equal, young Turkish girls identify with the Korean culture more.</p><p> All in all, Korean culture has made a significant and multi-dimensional impact on Turkish society that goes beyond music or television. Younger generations seem to look for inspiration in K-pop and K-drama icons. In the long run, this has the potential to change Turkish culture forever.</p><p>Loading poll …</p><p>Coming Soon</p><p> In your opinion, are Turkish and Korean related?</p><p> Yes  Yes19 (73.08 %)</p><p> No  No7 (26.92 %)</p><h2 id="New-2021-Study-Reveals-Millennia-Old-Evidence-on-the-Turkish-Korean-link"><a href="#New-2021-Study-Reveals-Millennia-Old-Evidence-on-the-Turkish-Korean-link" class="headerlink" title="New 2021 Study Reveals Millennia-Old Evidence on the Turkish-Korean link"></a>New 2021 Study Reveals Millennia-Old Evidence on the Turkish-Korean link</h2><p> A <a class="link"   href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/japanese-korean-turkish-language-group-traced-farmers-ancient-china-2021-11-10/" >new 2021 study <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> revealed that the Transeurasian (Altaic iteration) language family, including languages like Japanese, Korean, and Turkish, originated from millet farmers in northeastern China 9,000 years ago. As you can see, the findings of the new study basically support the Altaic family theory.</p><p> Covering 98 languages, the research integrates linguistic, archaeological, and genetic data, showing these languages spread over 5,000 miles as their speakers migrated.</p><p> The study contrasts the evolution of the Transeurasian languages with Chinese languages, attributing their development to separate agricultural practices. Additionally, it underlines that the formation of the Transeurasian (Altaic iteration) language family was not only the result of a single Neolithic migration but involved complex, prolonged interactions and mixing.</p><h2 id="The-Turkish-Korean-Connection-–-A-Mystery"><a href="#The-Turkish-Korean-Connection-–-A-Mystery" class="headerlink" title="The Turkish-Korean Connection – A Mystery"></a>The Turkish-Korean Connection – A Mystery</h2><p><strong>Are Turkish and Korean part of a single language family?</strong> Given the very little historical evidence, we can’t know for sure yet.</p><p> Although the discussion about whether these languages are related remains, the clear similarities and recent cultural exchanges reveal a profound human narrative of connection and curiosity.</p><p> The original puzzle is not entirely solved, but this exploration has shown us the interesting ways two languages can resemble each other across different continents, cultures and millennia.</p><p>Before you go, make sure to check out these FAQs.</p><h3 id="How-has-the-historical-relationship-between-Turkey-and-Korea-influenced-their-languages"><a href="#How-has-the-historical-relationship-between-Turkey-and-Korea-influenced-their-languages" class="headerlink" title="How has the historical relationship between Turkey and Korea influenced their languages?"></a>How has the historical relationship between Turkey and Korea influenced their languages?</h3><p> The Korean Wave has influenced an increased interest in learning the Korean language in Turkey.

However, the recent interest in learning and appreciating each other’s languages as a result of cultural diplomacy, media exchange, and educational programs is a significant aspect of the connection between the two nations. This cultural exchange fosters a mutual understanding and respect, bridging the gap between the two cultures through language.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/turkish-and-korean/&t=Unveiling+the+Intriguing+Relationship+Between+Turkish+and+Korean+Languages"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="Learn-both-Turkish-and-Korean-with-one-app"><a href="#Learn-both-Turkish-and-Korean-with-one-app" class="headerlink" title="Learn both Turkish and Korean with one app"></a>Learn both Turkish and Korean with one app</h3><p> Do you think Turkish and Korean are equally fascinating?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Discover-Why-Arabic-Online-Mondly-Lessons-Advantages"><a href="#Discover-Why-Arabic-Online-Mondly-Lessons-Advantages" class="headerlink" title="Discover Why Arabic Online: Mondly Lessons &amp; Advantages"></a>Discover Why Arabic Online: Mondly Lessons &amp; Advantages</h2><p> Learning foreign languages is an exciting and worthwhile endeavor. There are few qualities as impressive as being multilingual. From making a positive impact during a job interview to showing off in front of a date, you’ll be a stronger and more confident person after learning a new language.</p><p> If you have an interest in <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learning Arabic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you’re not alone. It’s the fifth most commonly spoken language on Earth. It’s estimated that around 250 million people are native speakers, and 420 million are fluent in the language. Aside from the obvious benefit of being able to converse with millions more people than you would have otherwise, there are some interesting aspects of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Arabic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> language that would make it an ideal skill to add to your repertoire.</p><h2 id="Learn-a-Language-Today-The-Many-Benefits-of-Learning-Arabic"><a href="#Learn-a-Language-Today-The-Many-Benefits-of-Learning-Arabic" class="headerlink" title="Learn a Language Today: The Many Benefits of Learning Arabic"></a>Learn a Language Today: The Many Benefits of Learning Arabic</h2><h3 id="1-Your-Skills-will-be-Useful-in-Over-20-Countries"><a href="#1-Your-Skills-will-be-Useful-in-Over-20-Countries" class="headerlink" title="1. Your Skills will be Useful in Over 20 Countries"></a>1. Your Skills will be Useful in Over 20 Countries</h3><p> We’ve already discussed that millions of people around the globe speak Arabic, but did you know that those people reside in over 20 different countries? Developing the ability to hold conversations in Arabic will open up a variety of options for traveling and working in various locations. This could potentially lead to more opportunities for your career as well.</p><h3 id="2-People-in-Many-Arabic-speaking-Countries-Tend-to-be-Friendly"><a href="#2-People-in-Many-Arabic-speaking-Countries-Tend-to-be-Friendly" class="headerlink" title="2. People in Many Arabic-speaking Countries Tend to be Friendly"></a>2. People in Many Arabic-speaking Countries Tend to be Friendly</h3><p> One aspect of learning a language is being able to practice that language with native speakers. While nice people can be found anywhere, certain cultures are somewhat less welcoming to outsiders. If you plan on working or traveling in Arabic-speaking countries such as Egypt, you’ll be glad to learn that the culture tends to lean toward the friendly side. Many Arabic speakers love holding conversations with English speakers and will be more than happy to help you practice your skills.</p><h3 id="3-You’ll-Be-Standing-Out-from-the-Crowd"><a href="#3-You’ll-Be-Standing-Out-from-the-Crowd" class="headerlink" title="3. You’ll Be Standing Out from the Crowd"></a>3. You’ll Be Standing Out from the Crowd</h3><p> While millions of people do speak Arabic, it’s not very common to study it as an English speaker. Arabic speakers are needed to bridge gaps in communication between English and Arabic countries, and many government agencies, private businesses, and nonprofit organizations are requesting more applicants who can speak the language. Yet, less than 1 percent of college students in the United States end up studying Arabic. This means that even developing moderate Arabic skills will place you ahead of the competition in a variety of industries.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sea-beach-holiday-vacation-min.jpg"                      alt="sea beach holiday vacation min" title="6 Exciting Reasons To Learn Arabic 2"                ></p><h3 id="4-There-are-Multiple-Interesting-Dialects-to-Choose-From"><a href="#4-There-are-Multiple-Interesting-Dialects-to-Choose-From" class="headerlink" title="4. There are Multiple Interesting Dialects to Choose From"></a>4. There are Multiple Interesting Dialects to Choose From</h3><p> There are dozens of dialects in the Arabic language. Modern Standard Arabic, which is usually what’s taught in schools and featured in the media, isn’t a native tongue. It’s fine to learn if you’re simply looking to get a basic grasp of the language, but if you know for sure that you’ll be living, studying or working in a certain country, then it’s a smart idea to research the local dialect. Once you discover the most commonly spoken dialect in your area, you can get right on the path to learning everything you need to know.</p><h3 id="5-You’ll-Be-Able-to-Encourage-a-Healthy-Understanding-of-Arab-Culture"><a href="#5-You’ll-Be-Able-to-Encourage-a-Healthy-Understanding-of-Arab-Culture" class="headerlink" title="5. You’ll Be Able to Encourage a Healthy Understanding of Arab Culture"></a>5. You’ll Be Able to Encourage a Healthy Understanding of Arab Culture</h3><p> Unfortunately, there are many tensions and misunderstandings surrounding the Arabic cultures in modern society. According to data from a 2017 poll by the Arab American Institute, a startling 32 percent of Americans have negative views of Arabic people. These opinions are shared by some people from other countries around the world as well.</p><p> As an English speaker learning Arabic, you will be bridging an important gap between two cultures. Aside from studying the language itself, you’ll naturally be exposed to deeper aspects of the culture, and that understanding will assist you in explaining the culture to others, especially those who might be misinformed about its various aspects.</p><h3 id="6-Arabic-is-an-Easy-Language-to-Learn"><a href="#6-Arabic-is-an-Easy-Language-to-Learn" class="headerlink" title="6. Arabic is an Easy Language to Learn"></a>6. Arabic is an Easy Language to Learn</h3><p> Don’t be scared off by how exotic it seems. Compared to the English language, Arabic is much more logical and easy to understand. What’s easy to one might prove to be difficult to another, and learning any new language can be a challenge. That said, some languages are more complicated than others, and Arabic is one of the easier choices for a native English speaker.</p><p> Most of the vocabulary is derived from root and stem consonants that aren’t difficult to memorize, and there’s no need to worry about noun cases in most of the local dialects. If you want to learn to write in Arabic, that will naturally take more time, but when it comes to speaking, you should be able to start developing a basic understanding within a short time of dedicated practice.</p><h2 id="The-Mental-Benefits-of-Language-Learning-Feed-Your-Brain"><a href="#The-Mental-Benefits-of-Language-Learning-Feed-Your-Brain" class="headerlink" title="The Mental Benefits of Language Learning: Feed Your Brain"></a>The Mental Benefits of Language Learning: Feed Your Brain</h2><p> You can now see that learning Arabic has many exciting benefits. Did you know that it can also improve your cognitive abilities?</p><p> If you already need to learn Arabic for career or personal reasons, you’ll be happy to learn the other benefits that come with it. Research has shown that learning a second language can increase intelligence. Much like the muscles of the body, the brain works when we work it. Therefore, studying languages can increase attention span, focus and problem-solving skills, all of which will also benefit your career and overall life experience.</p><p> Another interesting aspect of how learning foreign languages can benefit us is in the area of Alzheimer’s research. Studies have found that people who are bilingual delay the onset of Alzheimer’s by over four years.

Do you know how they say brides need something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue? Well, English had all of that except the blue. Anglo-Saxon words were old,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Shakespeare’s words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> were new and all the loanwords from other languages were borrowed. If you can’t put your finger on the <strong>English words borrowed from other languages, think_café, ballet, fiancé, spaghetti, espresso, pretzel._</strong>  You got the point.</p><p> Of course, this story is far from true, but that doesn’t mean it won’t help you remember how the modern English vocabulary came to be. Unexpected connections are a good strategy for remembering new things. Anyway, enough storytelling for now. Let’s see what common words English “took” from other languages.</p><h2 id="Where-did-English-Come-From"><a href="#Where-did-English-Come-From" class="headerlink" title="Where did English Come From?"></a>Where did English Come From?</h2><p> The earliest forms of English, collectively known as Old English or Anglo-Saxon, developed from the North Sea Germanic languages that came to Britain between the mid-5th and 7th centuries AD. This linguistic influence made its way to Britain through the migration of the Anglo-Saxons from what is now northwest Germany, southern Denmark, and the Netherlands.</p><p> Not long after that, in the 8th and 9th centuries, Old English began to borrow foreign words from the Old-<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Norse-speaking Viking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> invaders and settlers. Subsequently, in the late 11th century, Middle English emerged, marked by a new influx of borrowed words from Old French following the Norman Conquest of England.</p><p> Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the Renaissance trend of borrowing Latin and Greek words and roots, which also coincided with the Great Vowel Shift. The era culminated in the King James Bible and the works of William Shakespeare.</p><p> While the question may sound funny (“where did English come from?”), it is a popular inquiry among Google users for obvious reasons. After all, 1.3 billion people worldwide speak English either natively or as a second language. It’s only natural for them to be curious about the origin of the English language.</p><h2 id="English-Words-from-Foreign-Languages"><a href="#English-Words-from-Foreign-Languages" class="headerlink" title="English Words from Foreign Languages"></a>English Words from Foreign Languages</h2><ol><li>Guru (Sanskrit)</li><li>Tsunami (Japanese)</li><li>Versatile (Latin)</li><li>Vodka (Russian)</li><li>Chocolate (Nahuatl, an Aztec language)</li><li>Algebra (Arabic)</li><li>Banana (Wolof, a language spoken in Senegal)</li><li>Robot (Czech)</li><li>Tycoon (Japanese)</li><li>Yoga (Sanskrit)</li><li>Shampoo (Hindi)</li><li>Taco (Nahuatl)</li><li>Safari (Arabic)</li><li>Kangaroo (Guugu Yimithirr, an Australian Aboriginal language)</li><li>Czar (Russian)</li><li>Jungle (Hindi)</li><li>Boomerang (Dharuk, an Australian Aboriginal language)</li><li>Sushi (Japanese)</li><li>Pajamas (Hindi)</li><li>Loot (Sanskrit)</li><li>Mosquito (Latin)</li><li>Karaoke (Japanese)</li><li>Lemon (Arabic)</li><li>Penguin (Welsh)</li><li>Ninja (Japanese)</li><li>Ketchup (Chinese)</li><li>Algebra (Arabic)</li><li>Metropolis (Greek)</li><li>Avatar (Sanskrit)</li><li>Nemesis (Greek)</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/english-foreign-words-600x600.png"                      alt="English foreign words" title="100+ English Words Borrowed From Other Languages 4"                ></p><p> Although we usually call them “borrowed words”, these are also known as loanwords. According to Oxford Languages,<strong>a loanword</strong> is_“a word adopted from a foreign language with little or no modification”_ . The transition from one language to another can happen through:</p><ul><li><strong>Transcription,</strong> which means borrowing words while preserving their original pronunciation in the borrowed language;</li><li><strong>Transliteration,</strong> which involves adapting the written form of the loanword in accordance with the alphabet of the borrowing language;</li><li><strong>Loan translation,</strong> also known as calque, which involves borrowing words, phrases, or expressions by translating their literal meanings into the borrowing language.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/themes/mondly/img/mondly-banner-icon.png"                      alt="mondly banner icon" title="100+ English Words Borrowed From Other Languages 5"                ></p><h5 id="Improve-your-English-fast-🚀"><a href="#Improve-your-English-fast-🚀" class="headerlink" title="Improve your English fast 🚀"></a>Improve your English fast 🚀</h5><p> With Mondly, English mastery is at your fingertips – and in your native tongue.

Considering that French was the language of the English king and his court for over 300 years, it’s no surprise.

Words related to everyday life, family, and community were among the earliest borrowings. Later, thanks to Germany’s influence in various fields, English borrowed German words related to science and technology, music, philosophy, literature and engineering.</p><h2 id="Understanding-the-Size-of-the-English-Vocabulary"><a href="#Understanding-the-Size-of-the-English-Vocabulary" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Size of the English Vocabulary"></a>Understanding the Size of the English Vocabulary</h2><p> How many words are there in English? Many sources agree that<strong>the English language consists of roughly 470,000 words.</strong> However, most linguists advise to take that with a pinch of salt. While some words have become obsolete, new additions are always making their way into the English vocabulary, so it’s difficult to put our finger on an exact number. Then, there’s also the question of different variations of a single word like “go”, “went”, “gone”. Do we count that as a single word or as three separate ones?</p><p> One thing is certain: the English vocabulary is still expanding. As you know, English does not only borrow words from other languages, but it also constantly coins new words to reflect advances in technology.</p><p>Loading poll …</p><p>Coming Soon</p><p> Do you believe the claim that ~80% of the English vocabulary is borrowed from other languages?</p><p> Yes, English is a linguistic melting pot.

Some sources go as far as to say that approximately 80% of the English vocabulary is borrowed. While it may seem like a lot, English is known for its predilection to foreign words.

Often overlooked in basic vocabulary lessons, “sorry” can come up in daily situations more often than you think. Besides, it’s as easy to learn as the simple <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >“hello” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and just as effective!</p><p> Let’s look at the most important ways to say “sorry” in German and when to use each of them.</p><h2 id="When-should-you-say-you’re-sorry"><a href="#When-should-you-say-you’re-sorry" class="headerlink" title="When should you say you’re sorry?"></a>When should you say you’re sorry?</h2><p> What you need to remember is that learning how to say “sorry” in German also has a cultural component. It’s not enough to learn how to say you’re sorry; you also have to learn_when_ to say you’re sorry. Unlike Americans and even Brits who apologize quite a lot,<strong>Germans tend to keep their sorrys to a minimum.</strong> In fact, they say sorry so rarely that they can come off as rude to people of other nationalities.</p><p> However, this is not strictly a German thing. It’s true Germans say sorry once in a blue moon, but there are some other countries like France or Russia where over-apologizing can be regarded as insincere as well.</p><h2 id="How-to-apologize-in-German"><a href="#How-to-apologize-in-German" class="headerlink" title="How to apologize in German"></a>How to apologize in German</h2><p><em><strong>Es tut mir leid</strong></em> is the standard sorry or the apologetic sorry. It’s the kind of sorry you say when you messed up and you want to apologize for what you did. The expression conveys a sense of responsibility it is kind of a formal apology.</p><p> If you want it to be more informal, you can say_<strong>Tut mir leid</strong>_ which is more similar to “sorry” than “I’m sorry”.</p><p>Here are some practical examples of apologies in German:</p><ul><li><em>Es tut mir schrecklich leid!</em> – I’m terribly sorry!</li><li><em>Sie haben Recht, das tut mir leid.</em>  – You are right, I am sorry.</li><li><em>Tut mir leid, ich mag die Suppe nicht.</em> – Sorry, I don’t like the soup.</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-say-sorry-in-German-–-the-“Excuse-me”-sorry"><a href="#How-to-say-sorry-in-German-–-the-“Excuse-me”-sorry" class="headerlink" title="How to say sorry in German – the “Excuse me” sorry"></a>How to say sorry in German – the “Excuse me” sorry</h2><p> If you bump into someone on the street or cause a mishap, the most common way to say “sorry” in German is_<strong>Entschuldigung</strong>_ which literally means “apology!”. This is basically the “sorry” or the “excuse me” you say for a minor inconvenience. In other words, we’re talking about a slight bump or barely touching that person. If you knock them over, a cool_Entschuldigung_ won’t do, so you should probably apologize sincerely.</p><p> In case you need a more<strong>formal sorry</strong> for someone you don’t know or someone older, you should say**<em>Entschuldigen Sie.</em>** For <strong>informal situations,<em>Entschuldige</em> works best</strong> or you can use the abbreviated_<strong>‘Tschuldigung</strong>_ .</p><p> Hear the formal_Entschuldigen Sie_ in action in this basic conversation in German:</p><h2 id="Other-ways-to-say-sorry-in-German"><a href="#Other-ways-to-say-sorry-in-German" class="headerlink" title="Other ways to say sorry in German"></a>Other ways to say sorry in German</h2><p> As you very well know, there can also be other situations where you need to say “sorry” in German. For example, the “can you repeat that?” sorry is quite common. Of course, you can always say_“Entschuldigung?”_ together with the proper facial expression, but sometimes that might not be enough.</p><p><strong>How to offer your sympathies</strong></p><ul><li><em>Es tut mir sehr Leid, das zu hören.</em> – I’m so sorry to hear that.</li><li>Es tut mir Leid, dass dir das passiert ist. – I’m sorry that happened to you.</li><li>Mein aufrichtiges Beileid. – My sincerest condolences.</li></ul><p><strong>The “can you repeat that?” sorry</strong></p><ul><li><em>Entschuldigung?</em> – Excuse me?</li><li><em>Pardon?</em>  – Pardon? (very formal)</li><li><em>Häh?</em> <em>–</em>  Huh? (colloquial)</li><li><em>Wie meinen?</em> – I beg your pardon?</li><li><em>Entschuldigung, ich habe es immer noch nicht verstanden.</em> – Sorry, I still didn’t get that.</li></ul><p><strong>How to say sorry in a business context</strong></p><ul><li><em>Bitte entschuldigen Sie die Verzögerung.</em>  – Please forgive the delay.</li><li><em>Bitte entschuldigen Sie die verspätete Antwort.</em>  – Sorry for the late reply</li><li><em>Ich entschuldige mich für die Verwirrung.</em> – I apologize for the confusion.</li></ul><p><strong>How to apologize for the “no-biggie” mistake that didn’t hurt anyone</strong></p><ul><li><em>Hoppla!</em> – Oops!</li><li><em>Das war mein Fehler.</em> – It was my bad.</li></ul><p><strong>Other useful examples</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Entschuldige, es wird nicht wieder vorkommen.</em> – Sorry, it won’t happen again.</p></li><li><p><em>Ich entschuldige mich.</em> – I apologize.</p></li><li><p><em>Ich fühl mich furchtbar, es tut mir so Leid.</em> – I feel terrible, I’m so sorry.</p></li><li><p><em>Schade!</em> – Too bad!&#x2F;Pity!)</p></li><li><p>Entschuldigen Sie bitte, dass ich Sie störe. – Excuse me for disturbing you.</p></li><li><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/sorry-in-german/&t=How+to+Apologize+and+Say+Sorry+in+German"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></li><li><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></li></ul><hr><h3 id="From-0-to-conversational-in-German"><a href="#From-0-to-conversational-in-German" class="headerlink" title="From 0 to conversational in German"></a>From 0 to conversational in German</h3><p> Do you want to stop apologizing for your pronunciation?

Additionally, there are also some Finnish-speaking minorities in Russia, Norway and Sweden.</p><p> The Finnish language is a member of the Finno-Ugric group of the Uralic language family and although it had its first comprehensive writing system in the 16th century, it became an official language of Finland only in 1863.</p><p> While the FSI (Foreign Service Institute) of the US government classifies Finnish as a tier 4 language (of 5 tiers) in terms of learning difficulty for native English speakers, Dr. Riitta-Liisa Valijarvi, senior teaching fellow in Finnish Language at University College London, says Finnish doesn’t deserve its reputation as one of the <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >hardest languages to learn <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> “There are many grammatical cases (…) and the vocabulary is not familiar.

And for good reason! The Finnish language is notorious for the way it sounds to non-speakers who often say Finnish seems like a language from another universe or an alternate dimension.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/learn-finnish-online-960x648.jpg"                      alt="learn finnish online" title="This Is The Best Way To Learn Finnish Online 2"                ></p><p> “Helsinki, Finland” by Carlos “Grury” Santos©</p><h2 id="Finnish-learning-made-easy"><a href="#Finnish-learning-made-easy" class="headerlink" title="Finnish learning made easy"></a>Finnish learning made easy</h2><p> Let’s look at the bright side and see why Finnish is not actually that hard to learn.</p><p> First of all,<strong>Finnish has no grammatical gender.</strong> This means that there is no distinction between masculine, feminine, or neuter (not even in the personal pronouns).<em>Hän</em> , for example, can mean both “he” and “she”.</p><p> Additionally,<strong>Finnish also has no articles</strong> as we do in English.</p><p> Secondly – and most importantly –<strong>Finnish is pronounced as it is written.</strong> There is almost a 100% correspondence between letters and their sounds so you’ll have no problem reading Finnish even though you may not know what the words actually mean.</p><p> Thirdly,<strong>the Finnish language loves working with literal words.</strong> And you’ll love it too. A lot of Finnish words have very literal English translations that make learning super fun. For example, a computer is a “knowledge machine”_(tietokone)_ , a treadmill is a “running carpet”_(juoksumatto)_ and a refrigerator is an “ice cupboard”_(jääkaappi)_ .</p><p> Another interesting thing about Finnish is that it has some prepositions, but more postpositions. “What are postpositions?”, you’ll say. Well, postpositions are similar to prepositions, but they come<strong>after</strong> the word that they add meaning to.</p><p> Furthermore, – this doesn’t necessarily make Finnish easier to learn, but it’s a valuable piece of information for every Finnish beginner –<strong>Finnish is an agglutinative language.</strong> This means that words can be formed by attaching together pieces that add meaning to the word.</p><p> As you can see, Finnish truly fascinating and we promise you’ll have a great time <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5404&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5404?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=fi&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-5404?mother_lang=en_us?target_lang=fi" >learning it with Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> !</p><h2 id="Learn-Finnish-online-with-Mondly"><a href="#Learn-Finnish-online-with-Mondly" class="headerlink" title="Learn Finnish online with Mondly"></a>Learn Finnish online with Mondly</h2><p> You spoke.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Dream-in-a-Foreign-Tongue-Romantic-French-Narratives"><a href="#Dream-in-a-Foreign-Tongue-Romantic-French-Narratives" class="headerlink" title="Dream in a Foreign Tongue: Romantic French Narratives"></a>Dream in a Foreign Tongue: Romantic French Narratives</h2><p> Love inspires us to do bold and sometimes crazy things. Things that don’t necessarily identify with our beliefs or everyday actions. Some people move across the globe to be with their loved ones, and others travel long distances on a regular basis. But maybe the most common (yet sweet) behavior is <a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875"><strong>learning a new language</strong> in the name of love</a> . Or maybe just a few right words. Because_amour_ and_je t’aime_ sound much more romantic than_love_ and _ <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >I love you <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _  . Yes, French has its reputation for being the language of love and <a class="link"   href="https://www.thelocal.fr/20141107/french-translates-love-google-language" >Google Translate has already confirmed this <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> several times.</p><p> But why do we all consider<strong>French</strong> the universal<strong>language of love</strong> ? Is it a positive stereotype that we have all come to believe? History says “definitely no”. As we can <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History%5Fof%5FFrance" >read for ourselves <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> today, Paris and the French, in general, had a unique way of embracing art in all its forms. Art, new tendencies, and love, apparently. Being less religious than other Europeans made French people more open about matters that regard love and social emancipation. That and the famous <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubadour" >troubadours <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> played a huge part in this matter. This is why the French are, even in the present days, regarded as renowned lovers. Besides, we cannot argue that French sounds particularly melodious and intimate.</p><p> Because lovers all over the world just celebrated Valentine’s Day, I thought that it would be a great time to share with you a list of <strong>7 French movies that will inspire you to learn the language of love</strong> . And I am not talking just about romantic love. Love should be celebrated in all its forms today – every day – even if it’s not Valentine’s Day. So here are 7 movies that will probably throw you on an emotional rollercoaster.</p><h2 id="1-Un-Long-Dimanche-De-Fiancailles-2004"><a href="#1-Un-Long-Dimanche-De-Fiancailles-2004" class="headerlink" title="1. Un Long Dimanche De Fiançailles (2004)"></a>1. Un Long Dimanche De Fiançailles (2004)</h2><p> Following the story of Mathilde’s relentless search for her fiancé, who has disappeared from the trenches of the Somme during World War I, “Un long dimanche de fiançailles” is a great story of war, survival and, above all,<strong>love</strong> .</p><p> Determined to find out if her childhood sweetheart and fiancé actually died in the war, frail Mathilde slowly starts to resemble a genuine detective. Her journey creates a story about initiation in life and_amour_ that can (or cannot) overcome all odds.</p><p> The combination of period romance, detective story and black comedy is beautifully carved out. Watch it this weekend and let me know what you think about it in the comment section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/french-language-love-1024x576.png"                      alt="french-language-love" title="7 French Movies That Will Inspire You To Learn The Language Of Love 2"                ></p><p> Screen capture from “Un long dimanche de fiançailles”</p><h2 id="2-Le-Fabuleux-Destin-d’Amelie-Poulain-2002"><a href="#2-Le-Fabuleux-Destin-d’Amelie-Poulain-2002" class="headerlink" title="2.

Because that’s exactly what Amélie is: visual poetry.</p><p> The film follows the destiny of an innocent and maybe even naive young woman who decides to help those around her and discovers love in the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/learn-french-movies-1024x576.png"                      alt="learn-french-movies" title="7 French Movies That Will Inspire You To Learn The Language Of Love 3"                ></p><p> Screen capture from “Le fabuleux destin d’Amélie Poulain”</p><p> Honestly, it is really hard not to fall under the spell of this charming and deliciously romantic movie. Especially if you had a similar and quirky first-love experience.</p><h2 id="3-Intouchables-2011"><a href="#3-Intouchables-2011" class="headerlink" title="3. Intouchables (2011)"></a>3. Intouchables (2011)</h2><p> If you have a best friend, you definitely have to watch this one. It will touch a chord. Or even two. I’m not even kidding! “Intouchables” follows the story of an unlikely friendship between a quadriplegic grumpy aristocrat and his young and funny caregiver. I mean, can it get more emotional than that?</p><p> This may not sound flattering, but this movie is beautifully predictable (yes, you read that right). And also humorous and extremely touching. In other words, perfect for a chill Sunday afternoon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/language-of-love-1024x576.jpg"                      alt="language-of-love" title="7 French Movies That Will Inspire You To Learn The Language Of Love 4"                ></p><p> Screen capture from “Intouchables”</p><p> It’s a clash between classes, a story about the healing power of friendship and people. If you ask me, it sounds like the perfect recipe for a movie designed to be a crowd-pleaser.</p><h2 id="4-Paris-Je-t’Aime-2006"><a href="#4-Paris-Je-t’Aime-2006" class="headerlink" title="4. Paris, Je t’Aime (2006)"></a>4. Paris, Je t’Aime (2006)</h2><p> There’s no need to tell you more about “Paris, je t’aime”. Its title is self-explanatory and even relatable for some of us. Paris is definitely a lovable city. And it has a long history of being a lovable city.<a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege%5Fof%5FParis%5F%28845%29" >Viking raiders approve <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> this message.</p><p> On the other hand, if you are looking for a movie about a great love story, this is not one of them. Because it is actually about 18 love stories (Gotcha!). Every single one unique in its own way. 18 love stories about French people, tourists or immigrants falling in love. Relatable enough for me.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/learn-french-1024x576.jpg"                      alt="learn-french" title="7 French Movies That Will Inspire You To Learn The Language Of Love 5"                ></p><p> Screen capture from “Paris, je t’aime”</p><p> All in all, this is a bohemian’s delight: two hours of short films celebrating love in the most romantic city in the world.</p><h2 id="5-Jeux-d’Enfants-2003"><a href="#5-Jeux-d’Enfants-2003" class="headerlink" title="5. Jeux d’Enfants (2003)"></a>5. Jeux d’Enfants (2003)</h2><p> I don’t remember when I first fell in love with Marion Cotillard. Theatrically speaking, of course. But there’s a great chance it might have been when I saw this movie. She’s one of the most talented actresses today, and “Jeux d’enfants” was the movie that set her career in motion.</p><p> This movie is for those of us who have a contagious fascination with watching people for whom going too far is never far enough.</p><p> Imagine teasing and tormenting your crush today, as an adult, the same way you did when you were a child. “Jeux d’enfants” is about this on a much larger scale. It’s a game of daring and loving that never ends. Deliciously entertaining!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/french-movies-learn-language-love-1024x576.jpg"                      alt="french-movies-learn-language-love" title="7 French Movies That Will Inspire You To Learn The Language Of Love 6"                ></p><p> Screen capture from “Jeux d’enfants”</p><h2 id="6-L’Auberge-Espagnole-2002"><a href="#6-L’Auberge-Espagnole-2002" class="headerlink" title="6. L’Auberge Espagnole (2002)"></a>6. L’Auberge Espagnole (2002)</h2><p> I was reluctant when a friend of mine first recommended me to see this movie. I honestly thought this was just another lame comedy about the cultural clash between global students. But boy, was I wrong!</p><p>“L’auberge espagnole” follows the story of a French student who moves into an apartment in Barcelona together with six other students from all over Europe. They are young, restless and loving. What more can you want?</p><p> If you studied at least one semester in another country, you will relate to this movie and love it. If you didn’t study in another country, you will probably wish you did. Just see it and apply for that Erasmus scholarship already!</p><p> Charming and exhilarating, the end of this movie will leave you wanting more time with its inexperienced characters.</p><h2 id="7-Les-Choristes-2004"><a href="#7-Les-Choristes-2004" class="headerlink" title="7. Les Choristes (2004)"></a>7. Les Choristes (2004)</h2><p> Music and love are international languages and this heart-warming movie is about both. Following the story of a severely administered boys’ boarding school and how the new teacher uses the healing power of music to change things, “Les Choristes” is infused with nostalgia and love.</p><p> You may think “Les Choristes” is the European emotional version of “Dead Poets Society” and you wouldn’t be wrong. The only difference is that the interpretation of certain music pieces in “Les Choristes” will probably give you goosebumps. Watch this sneak peek and let yourself fall in love with this boy’s voice:</p><p>By the way, this is all real singing!</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/7-french-movies-will-inspire-learn-language-love/&t=7+French+Movies+That+Will+Inspire+You+to+Learn+the+Language+of+Love"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h4 id="Learn-French-fast-in-just-10-minutes-a-day"><a href="#Learn-French-fast-in-just-10-minutes-a-day" class="headerlink" title="Learn French fast in just 10 minutes a day"></a>Learn French fast in just 10 minutes a day</h4><p> Do you want to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >speak French fluently <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> fast?

The words from our<strong>list of 100 most misspelled words in English</strong> pose challenges for more people than you think. No matter if you’re an English native speaker or not, hard-to-spell words are determined to give you a headache. And if bad spelling does happen, it’s usually in very important contexts like your application letter or during a conversation with your crush – can’t decide which one is more heartbreaking. 💔 So, you can probably agree that correct spelling in written communication is crucial regardless of the context.</p><p> Whether we’re talking about fancy words or downright common ones like “license” (not “lisence”), misspellings are like Thanos: inevitable. But even Thanos was finally defeated, so you, too, can vanquish misspelled words. The first step is to acknowledge them, so let’s do it. We’ll begin with a small but condensed list of the most misspelled words ever and continue with a complete list of the top 100 commonly misspelled words in English. Ready, steady, go!</p><h2 id="Top-10-Most-Commonly-Misspelled-Words-in-English"><a href="#Top-10-Most-Commonly-Misspelled-Words-in-English" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Most Commonly Misspelled Words in English"></a>Top 10 Most Commonly Misspelled Words in English</h2><h3 id="1-Awkward-not-akward"><a href="#1-Awkward-not-akward" class="headerlink" title="1. Awkward not akward"></a>1. Awkward not akward</h3><p> This one will haunt some of us for the rest of our days because it also describes how we feel when we realize we’ve just misspelled a word.</p><h3 id="2-Believe-not-belive"><a href="#2-Believe-not-belive" class="headerlink" title="2. Believe not belive"></a>2. Believe not belive</h3><p> There’s a famous rhyme in English that says I before E, except after C. The exact same rule applies to “believe”, so it’s advisable to use this mnemonic when in doubt.</p><p>Careful, though – there are some exceptions to it.</p><h3 id="3-Embarrassed-not-embarassed"><a href="#3-Embarrassed-not-embarassed" class="headerlink" title="3. Embarrassed not embarassed"></a>3. Embarrassed not embarassed</h3><p>Also commonly misspelled as: embarrased</p><p> This is another classic case of two sets of double letters. You’ll reduce the chances of finding yourself in an embarrassing bad spelling situation if you remember this one.</p><h3 id="4-Entrepreneur-not-enterpreneur"><a href="#4-Entrepreneur-not-enterpreneur" class="headerlink" title="4. Entrepreneur not enterpreneur"></a>4. Entrepreneur not enterpreneur</h3><p>Also commonly misspelled as: entrepeneur , entreprenur , entreperneur</p><p> We honestly can’t blame whoever misspells this one. It’s not only hard to spell but also <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >hard to pronounce <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The reason? It’s a French word coming from the root entreprendre (‘undertake’).</p><h3 id="5-Liaison-not-liasion"><a href="#5-Liaison-not-liasion" class="headerlink" title="5. Liaison not liasion"></a>5. Liaison not liasion</h3><p> There’s a reason why you’re never sure how to spell “liaison”, “bureaucracy”, “manoeuvre”, “questionnaire”, and “connoisseur”. They do not follow the same patterns because they are all <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >French words <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p>Your best bet is to just remember the correct spelling.</p><h3 id="6-License-not-lisence"><a href="#6-License-not-lisence" class="headerlink" title="6. License not lisence"></a>6. License not lisence</h3><p> This is a special situation. In American English, it’s always spelled “license” – no matter what. On the other hand, in British English, it’s spelled “license” when it’s a verb and “licence” when it’s a noun.</p><p> Basically, the only wrong spelling is “lisense”. However, once you decide which spelling you’re going to use – American or British – it’s best to go forward with that one don’t combine both.</p><h3 id="7-Receive-not-recieve"><a href="#7-Receive-not-recieve" class="headerlink" title="7. Receive not recieve"></a>7. Receive not recieve</h3><p> Remember the “I before E, except after C” rule? This is the kind of word where the rule applies. It also applies to “niece” and “siege”, but it doesn’t apply to “weird” or “seize”. So trust the rule, but keep in mind it has some exceptions.</p><h3 id="8-Successful-not-successfull"><a href="#8-Successful-not-successfull" class="headerlink" title="8. Successful not successfull"></a>8. Successful not successfull</h3><p>Also commonly misspelled as: succesful, sucessful</p><p> There are so many double consonants in English that it becomes tempting to double them all sometimes. But for the love of English, don’t do that to “successful”.</p><h3 id="9-Thorough-not-thourough"><a href="#9-Thorough-not-thourough" class="headerlink" title="9. Thorough not thourough"></a>9. Thorough not thourough</h3><p> You probably heard this tongue twister before: “English can be understood through tough thorough thought, though.” It’s hard not to get confused with so many similar-looking words. You add an O to “through” and its pronunciation changes completely.</p><h3 id="10-Until-not-untill"><a href="#10-Until-not-untill" class="headerlink" title="10. Until not untill"></a>10. Until not untill</h3><p> This one is somehow similar to the “successful” situation, but not entirely. As a matter of fact, “until” was spelled with two Ls in the Middle Ages. If it helps you remember, you can think it just lost some weight but getting rid of the last L (unlike “still”).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hard-words-to-spell-960x641.jpg"                      alt="&quot;Hard words to spell&quot; by Julia M Cameron©" title="Top 100 Most Misspelled Words In English 2"                ></p><h2 id="Why-Spelling-Matters"><a href="#Why-Spelling-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Why Spelling Matters"></a>Why Spelling Matters</h2><p> English has drawn inspiration from many different languages, so it’s perfectly normal to get confused because of its double consonants and silent letters. We all know that moment when you stare at a word for ages and still can’t believe it has two sets of double letters. But it’s true. There are many such examples. In fact, “misspelled” is one of them and people often misspell it.</p><p>Loading poll …</p><p>Coming Soon</p><p> What is the hardest word to spell for you?</p><p> Awkward  Awkward52 (17.16 %)</p><p> Embarrassed  Embarrassed152 (50.17 %)</p><p> License  License73 (24.09 %)</p><p> Successful  Successful26 (8.58 %)</p><p> Anyway, it’s easy to make excuses! We’ve all been there. But the truth is that spelling matters. Not only in professional settings but everywhere in life. Sometimes, your spelling is the first impression someone gets of you. What would your future employer think if you wrote “aquire” instead of “acquire” or “bizzare” instead of “bizarre” (easy with the Zs, Buzz)? Good spelling can be the difference between losing or getting that dream job.</p><p> But why is that? Why do people place such a high importance on spelling? Well, good spelling can tell a couple of things about you:</p><ul><li><strong>You pay attention to details:</strong> Employers often consider this a great asset to have in today’s world. If, unlike other candidates, you spelled Mrs. Saoirse’s name right in your letter of application, you may get an extra point for attention to detail!</li><li><strong>You’re a perfectionist:</strong> Contrary to what some people may think, being a perfectionist is not always a bad thing. If you’re a perfectionist, you won’t permit bad spelling to make you seem sloppy.</li><li><strong>You respect your readers:</strong> Regardless of how many people will read your work, good spelling shows that you value the time they take to do it.</li><li><strong>You have a strong educational background:</strong> Proficiency in spelling often indicates a good grasp of the language.

Improving Your Spelling</h2><p> How do you avoid misspellings? One obvious answer would be spell-checkers. Alas, spell-checkers won’t actually help you to improve your spelling. You will continue to misspell words and they’ll continue to correct them like the good friends they are. This process won’t stimulate you to learn the correct spelling because somebody else already does the job for you. However, if you do want a very good spell-checker to keep you in check, we recommend Grammarly.</p><p> Supposing you really want to improve your English spelling, you’ll just have to practice. Go through this list, then add your own commonly misspelled words and practice writing them a few times. You’ll get the hang of it with just a few attempts.</p><p> If you’re only starting to <a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >learn English <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (or any other language), put your best foot forward with a language learning app such as <a class="link"   href="https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-7340&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-7340&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect_ios=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987873536&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?avangate_src=blog-post-id-7340" >Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Not only does the app include spelling exercises, but it also gives you access to quick lesson reviews with all the words you’ve learned. The best way to avoid bad spelling is to convince your brain to remember the correct spelling from day one!</p><p>Let’s recap. To improve your spelling, you can:</p><ul><li><strong>Practice proofreading:</strong> In other words, carefully check for errors in your text before sharing or publishing it.</li><li><strong>Use spell-checkers:</strong> Grammarly is the best at keeping your written communication tidy, but we can also rely on Word’s built-in spell-checker or even ask ChatGPT or Google when you’re not sure whether your word is spelled right or not.</li><li><strong>Memorize challenging words:</strong> We all have some words we keep getting wrong. So, our recommendation would be to take a pen and a piece of paper and write them by hand a few times until they stick. It’s traditional but it works.</li></ul><h2 id="Why-Some-Words-Are-Tricky"><a href="#Why-Some-Words-Are-Tricky" class="headerlink" title="Why Some Words Are Tricky"></a>Why Some Words Are Tricky</h2><p> When it comes to spelling, the English language is a real maverick. No wonder there are spelling bee competitions organized for young English-speaking students.</p><p>English words can be tricky to spell for several reasons:</p><ol><li><strong>Silent letters:</strong> These are not pronounced, but they are included in the spelling, which makes the job even harder. Thank you, English!</li><li><strong>Double consonants:</strong> There are so many of them in English, that it’s tempting to use them even when you’re not supposed to.</li><li><strong>Homophones:</strong> Words that sound the same but are spelled differently? A nightmare for spelling. Is it “their,” “there,” or “they’re”? It can be hard to tell.</li><li><strong>Exceptions to rules:</strong> Remember “I before E, except after C”? Well, that’s not true for “weird”, “height” and many others.</li><li><strong>Phonetic inconsistencies:</strong> To top it all off, the same sound can be spelled in different ways in different words (like the “oo” sound in “boot” and “blood”), and the same spelling can represent different sounds (like the “ough” in “through,” “though,” “tough,” and “thought”).</li></ol><p> Still, no matter how tricky, we love the English language because it brings everyone together. At this point in time, it wouldn’t be wrong to call it the_lingua franca_ of the world. A_lingua franca_ is a language used for communication between people who do not share a native language.

In American English, “misspelled” is the standard past tense and past participle form. However, “misspelt” is commonly used in British English, although “misspelled” is also acceptable.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/commonly-misspelled-words-english/&t=Top+100+Most+Misspelled+Words+in+English"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h4 id="Improve-your-English-fast"><a href="#Improve-your-English-fast" class="headerlink" title="Improve your English fast"></a>Improve your English fast</h4><p> Do you want to get better at speaking and writing English fast?

Wishing someone to break their leg doesn’t sound especially friendly. But they are a valuable addition to your vocabulary. For instance, if you want to speak German like a fluent speaker, German idioms are probably the fastest way to get to it.</p><p> Once you start learning, the most exciting thing about<strong>German idioms</strong> is that <strong>they feel like learning a super secret code only the fluent speakers understand.</strong> As they provide useful insights into German culture and history, including idioms in your day-to-day conversations will make you sound like “one of their own.” So let’s cut to the chase and present you with the essential collection of German idioms designed to up your German game fast.</p><h2 id="Common-German-idioms-Germans-love"><a href="#Common-German-idioms-Germans-love" class="headerlink" title="Common German idioms Germans love"></a>Common German idioms Germans love</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/idiom" >Cambridge Dictionary <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> defines ‘idiom’ as “a group of words in a fixed order that has a particular meaning that is different from the meanings of each word on its own.” For example, to be “over the moon” is an idiom that means you are extremely happy or delighted. In other words, idioms have figurative, non-literal meanings because you’re not<strong>literally</strong> “over the moon.”</p><p> That being said, let’s see what such idioms Germans use the most in their daily interactions.</p><h3 id="1-Um-den-heisen-Brei-herumreden"><a href="#1-Um-den-heisen-Brei-herumreden" class="headerlink" title="1.Um den heißen Brei herumreden"></a>1.<em>Um den heißen Brei herumreden</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> To talk around the hot porridge.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> To beat around the bush.</p><p> Germans are usually pretty straightforward, but there are times when even they happen to beat around the bush. When such a situation occurs, you can use this idiom to invite them to get straight to the point.</p><h3 id="2-Eine-Extrawurst-haben"><a href="#2-Eine-Extrawurst-haben" class="headerlink" title="2. Eine Extrawurst haben"></a><strong>2.</strong> <em>Eine Extrawurst haben</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> To ask for an extra sausage.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> To ask for special treatment.</p><p> Germans and sausages go together like… well, Germans and sausages! For this reason, it’s no surprise that their idioms include_wursts_ . Even if the special treatment implies getting more dessert,<a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Germans will still say <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you’re asking for an extra sausage.</p><h3 id="3-Lugen-haben-kurze-Beine"><a href="#3-Lugen-haben-kurze-Beine" class="headerlink" title="3. Lügen haben kurze Beine"></a><strong>3.</strong> <em>Lügen haben kurze Beine</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> Lies have short legs.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> Lies won’t get you far.</p><p> Is someone lying to your face? Better remind them that_Lügen haben kurze Beine_ or lies won’t get them too far with those tiny legs. This idiom is similar to the English expression “Liar, liar, pants on fire.”</p><h3 id="4-Ich-glaube-ich-spinne"><a href="#4-Ich-glaube-ich-spinne" class="headerlink" title="4. Ich glaube ich spinne"></a><strong>4.</strong> <em>Ich glaube ich spinne</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> I believe I spider.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> I think I’m going crazy.</p><p> As odd as this one sounds, it will come in very handy in those situations when you can’t believe what you’re hearing or seeing. The English equivalent could be “You’ve got to be kidding me!”.</p><h3 id="5-Seinen-Senf-dazugeben"><a href="#5-Seinen-Senf-dazugeben" class="headerlink" title="5. Seinen Senf dazugeben"></a><strong>5.</strong> <em>Seinen Senf dazugeben</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> To add your mustard to it.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> To give your opinion on something.&#x2F;To give your two cents.</p><p> Where there are sausages, there also must be mustard. If you want to ask someone for their opinion and sound like a fluent speaker when doing it, you better invite them to add their mustard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/german-idioms-in-english-960x640.jpg"                      alt="&#39;German idioms in English&#39; by Ron Lach©" title="Top 25 German Idioms To Speak Like A German 2"                ></p><h3 id="6-Die-Kirche-im-Dorf-lassen"><a href="#6-Die-Kirche-im-Dorf-lassen" class="headerlink" title="6. Die Kirche im Dorf lassen"></a><strong>6.</strong> <em>Die Kirche im Dorf lassen</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> Leave the church in the village.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> Don’t get carried away.</p><p> If you ever get carried away with excitement, German speakers may advise you_die Kirche im Dorf lassen_ , which means to “leave the church in the village.”</p><h3 id="7-Tomaten-auf-den-Augen-haben"><a href="#7-Tomaten-auf-den-Augen-haben" class="headerlink" title="7. Tomaten auf den Augen haben"></a><strong>7.</strong> <em>Tomaten auf den Augen haben</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> To have tomatoes on one’s eyes.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> To be oblivious to what’s going on around you.</p><p> In Germany, when you are blind to what’s happening around you, people could say you have tomatoes on your eyes. Maybe you’re not up to date with the latest news, or you’re not seeing the truth staring you right in the face. Either way, tomatoes seem to affect your vision.</p><h3 id="8-Ich-verstehe-nur-Bahnhof"><a href="#8-Ich-verstehe-nur-Bahnhof" class="headerlink" title="8. Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof"></a><strong>8.</strong> <em>Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> I can only understand ‘train station.’</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> I don’t understand anything.&#x2F;It’s all Greek to me.</p><p> The origin of this idiom goes back to World War I when deployed German soldiers would say that the only thing they understood when given orders was ‘train station’ because they hoped to go home. Nowadays, it’s used to say you didn’t comprehend something that was explained to you.</p><h3 id="9-Man-soll-den-Tag-nicht-vor-dem-Abend-lobe-n"><a href="#9-Man-soll-den-Tag-nicht-vor-dem-Abend-lobe-n" class="headerlink" title="9. Man soll den Tag nicht vor dem Abend lobe n"></a><strong>9.</strong> <em>Man soll den Tag nicht vor dem Abend lobe</em> n</h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> One shouldn’t praise the day before the evening.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> Don’t count your chickens before they hatch.</p><p> This idiom is perfect for those who usually celebrate their victories prematurely. Its sentiment is similar to the English equivalent “Don’t count your chickens before they hatch. “</p><h3 id="10-Da-kannst-du-Gift-drauf-nehmen"><a href="#10-Da-kannst-du-Gift-drauf-nehmen" class="headerlink" title="10. Da kannst du Gift drauf nehmen"></a><strong>10.</strong> <em>Da kannst du Gift drauf nehmen</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> You can take poison on that.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> You can bet your life on that.&#x2F;You can bet on it.</p><p> After all the funny idioms about food and animals, it’s time for a more grim one. If you’re absolutely certain of the information you are giving, you can assure the person you are talking to by saying_Da kannst du Gift drauf nehmen_ , which essentially means “you can bet on it.”</p><h3 id="11-Du-gehst-mir-auf-den-Keks"><a href="#11-Du-gehst-mir-auf-den-Keks" class="headerlink" title="11. Du gehst mir auf den Keks"></a><strong>11.</strong> <em>Du gehst mir auf den Keks</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> You’re walking on my cookie.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> You’re annoying me.</p><p> Now that’s a fun way of saying someone is getting on your nerves! It’s so cute that we’re actually thinking of making a petition to adopt it in English as well. Are you in?</p><h3 id="12-Da-steppt-der-Bar"><a href="#12-Da-steppt-der-Bar" class="headerlink" title="12. Da steppt der Bär"></a><strong>12.</strong> <em>Da steppt der Bär</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> The bear dances there.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> It’s a good party.</p><p> There are several ways to look at this one, but the main idea is that the party is so good that the bear will also join it. Or — there’s a dancing bear at the party and you should absolutely not miss it. Either way, this party is probably the best party ever.</p><h3 id="13-Das-ist-ein-Katzensprung"><a href="#13-Das-ist-ein-Katzensprung" class="headerlink" title="13. Das ist ein Katzensprung"></a><strong>13.</strong> <em>Das ist ein Katzensprung</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> That’s a cat’s jump.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> A stone’s throw away.</p><p> In Germany, if you want to say that a place is not far from here, you usually say “that’s a cat’s jump.” Way more fun than the English “a stone’s throw away.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/common-german-idioms-960x640.jpg"                      alt="&#39;Common German idioms&#39; by Gratisography©" title="Top 25 German Idioms To Speak Like A German 3"                ></p><h3 id="14-Das-ist-Schnee-von-gestern"><a href="#14-Das-ist-Schnee-von-gestern" class="headerlink" title="14. Das ist Schnee von gestern"></a><strong>14.</strong> <em>Das ist Schnee von gestern</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> That’s yesterday’s snow.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> To insist on something that has passed.&#x2F;To beat a dead horse.</p><p> Is someone you know constantly talking about an issue that is over and decided? <em>Das ist Schnee von gestern</em> is perfect in this context.</p><h3 id="15-Ein-Fisch-auf-dem-Trockenen"><a href="#15-Ein-Fisch-auf-dem-Trockenen" class="headerlink" title="15. Ein Fisch auf dem Trockenen"></a><strong>15.</strong> <em>Ein Fisch auf dem Trockenen</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> A fish on the dry.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> To feel like a fish out of the water.</p><p> It’s interesting how similar this idiom is to our English equivalent. It looks like feeling out of place is finally something more languages can agree on.</p><h3 id="16-Die-Daumen-drucken"><a href="#16-Die-Daumen-drucken" class="headerlink" title="16. Die Daumen drücken"></a><strong>16.</strong> <em>Die Daumen drücken</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> Press the thumbs.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> Fingers crossed.</p><p> Same story here. You already know in which situations it’s suitable to use this one.</p><h3 id="17-Du-nimmst-mich-auf-den-Arm"><a href="#17-Du-nimmst-mich-auf-den-Arm" class="headerlink" title="17. Du nimmst mich auf den Arm"></a><strong>17.</strong> <em>Du nimmst mich auf den Arm</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> You’re taking me on your arm.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> You’re joking.&#x2F;You’re pulling my leg.</p><p> Germans have a unique take on this idiom. Instead of pulling one’s leg, they are taken on someone’s arm. Picture the scene and you can help but giggle! Obviously, both versions are used to express disbelief about someone’s actions or claims.</p><h3 id="18-Dumm-wie-Bohnenstroh"><a href="#18-Dumm-wie-Bohnenstroh" class="headerlink" title="18. Dumm wie Bohnenstroh"></a><strong>18.</strong> <em>Dumm wie Bohnenstroh</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> Dumb as a bean straw.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> As thick as a brick.&#x2F;Dumb as a post.</p><p> We don’t support insults, but this one can also be used as a joke between very – and we mean<strong>very</strong> – close friends.</p><h3 id="19-Alles-hat-ein-Ende-nur-die-Wurst-hat-zwei"><a href="#19-Alles-hat-ein-Ende-nur-die-Wurst-hat-zwei" class="headerlink" title="19. Alles hat ein Ende, nur die Wurst hat zwei"></a><strong>19.</strong> <em>Alles hat ein Ende, nur die Wurst hat zwei</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> Everything has an end. Only the sausage has two.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> Everything will come to an end eventually.</p><p> Sausages again! Even when they come up with witty remarks about life itself, Germans must make a reference to_wursts_ . We do feel inspired, but we must admit we’re also drooling at this point.</p><h3 id="20-Ich-habe-Schwein-gehabt"><a href="#20-Ich-habe-Schwein-gehabt" class="headerlink" title="20. Ich habe Schwein gehabt"></a><strong>20.</strong> <em>Ich habe Schwein gehabt</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> I’ve had a pig.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> I was lucky.</p><p> I guess it is inevitable. If there are German idioms about sausages, there must also be German idioms about pigs. Naturally, when someone says_Ich habe Schwein gehabt_ , it means they have been lucky without having done anything themselves to earn it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/german-expressions-960x640.jpg"                      alt="&#39;German expressions&#39; by Picography©" title="Top 25 German Idioms To Speak Like A German 4"                ></p><h3 id="21-Haare-auf-den-Zahnen-haben"><a href="#21-Haare-auf-den-Zahnen-haben" class="headerlink" title="21. Haare auf den Zähnen haben"></a><strong>21.</strong> <em>Haare auf den Zähnen haben</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> To have hair on one’s teeth.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> To be confrontational or bossy.</p><p> That’s just weird, but okay, German. If someone’s having one of those days, it may prove helpful the lighten the mood with this funny idiom.</p><h3 id="22-Einen-Kater-haben"><a href="#22-Einen-Kater-haben" class="headerlink" title="22. Einen Kater haben"></a><strong>22.</strong> <em>Einen Kater haben</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> To have a cat.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> To have a hangover.</p><p> As you can see, Germans have all kinds of animals when it comes to idioms. This time, however, having a cat is not as fun as you’d imagine because it actually refers to having a hangover.</p><p> Before you jump to conclusions, you must know that_Kater_ (‘tomcat’) comes from the word_Katarrh_ , a condition in which a lot of thick liquid is produced in your nose and throat. Over time, the pronunciation of the word changed into_Kater_ .</p><h3 id="23-Da-haben-wir-den-Salat"><a href="#23-Da-haben-wir-den-Salat" class="headerlink" title="23. Da haben wir den Salat"></a><strong>23.</strong> <em>Da haben wir den Salat</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> There we have the salad.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> Now we have a problem.&#x2F;Now we are in a real mess.</p><p> Sometimes we see a bad situation coming and we warn the parties involved, but they choose not to listen. Well, this idiom is perfect for the aftermath when all you want to say is: I told you so!</p><h3 id="24-Einen-Vogel-haben"><a href="#24-Einen-Vogel-haben" class="headerlink" title="24. Einen Vogel haben"></a><strong>24.</strong> <em>Einen Vogel haben</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> To have a bird.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> To be crazy.</p><p> So far, we have had pigs, cats, tomatoes on our eyes and now birds. A fascinating selection of things to have, German!</p><p> On a more serious note, this is yet another fun idiom you can use to sound like a fluent speaker. The idiom probably originated from the belief that crazy people must have flocks of little birds in their heads.</p><p>It’s usually used as an insult, so be careful to who you are saying this.</p><h3 id="25-Jemandem-ein-Ohr-abkauen"><a href="#25-Jemandem-ein-Ohr-abkauen" class="headerlink" title="25. Jemandem ein Ohr abkauen"></a><strong>25.</strong> <em>Jemandem ein Ohr abkauen</em></h3><p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> Chew off someone’s ear.</p><p><strong>Actual meaning:</strong> To talk someone’s ear off.</p><p> Do you have someone in your life who just won’t stop talking? If you feel like your ear will fall off, this is the perfect example of <em>Jemandem ein Ohr abkauen</em> .</p><h2 id="Why-should-you-learn-German-idioms"><a href="#Why-should-you-learn-German-idioms" class="headerlink" title="Why should you learn German idioms?"></a><strong>Why should you learn German idioms?</strong></h2><p> No matter how funny or weird, German idioms are, first and foremost, a great way to boost your German vocabulary.

It shares a border with Slovenia, Hungary, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Its coastline faces the Adriatic Sea. The main dialect of the Croatian language is štokavski, but kajkavski and čakavski are other common dialects in the area. All of these dialects share similarities with the languages spoken in the surrounding countries. However, Croatian is written using the Latin alphabet, whereas the other languages feature the Cyrillic alphabet.</p><h2 id="Reasons-to-Learn-Croatian-A-Personal-Journey-with-a-Beautiful-Language"><a href="#Reasons-to-Learn-Croatian-A-Personal-Journey-with-a-Beautiful-Language" class="headerlink" title="Reasons to Learn Croatian: A Personal Journey with a Beautiful Language"></a>Reasons to Learn Croatian: A Personal Journey with a Beautiful Language</h2><p>Have you always wanted to <a class="link"   href="https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-903&fallback=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-903&utm_source=blog-post-id-903&redirect_macos=https://app.mondly.com?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-903&utm_source=blog-post-id-903&redirect_android=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages?utm_medium=blog_blog-post-id-903&utm_source=blog-post-id-903&redirect_ios=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id987873536?pt=78954800&ct=blog-post-id-903&mt=8" >learn a new language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  ? Do you need a push to get you motivated to begin? Maybe you know that you want to expand your mind by learning a language, but you aren’t sure which language to choose. Some people need to learn a certain language for work purposes, but others don’t feel a pull toward any particular tongue. If so, you might want to add Croatian to the list of foreign languages you are considering.</p><h3 id="1-Learning-Croatian-Provides-a-Gateway-to-Other-Languages"><a href="#1-Learning-Croatian-Provides-a-Gateway-to-Other-Languages" class="headerlink" title="1.

Learning Croatian Provides a Gateway to Other Languages</h3><p> After you learn the basics of Croatian, you will be able to pick up on similar languages, such as Bosnian, Serbian, Bulgarian, and Slovenian. Each of these languages shares similarities with Croatian. However, as we mentioned, Croatian features the Latin alphabet, making it the best of these languages for an English speaker to begin with.</p><h3 id="2-Croatia-Has-a-Magical-Landscape"><a href="#2-Croatia-Has-a-Magical-Landscape" class="headerlink" title="2.

Aside from the quaint farmlands and beautiful rolling hills, there are more than 1200 islands you can visit during your stay. The country has eight national parks and even more nature areas that hikers and rock climbers may enjoy visiting. Fans of the hit HBO show “Game of Thrones” will also be excited to learn that some of the show was filmed on location in the country.</p><p> When visiting, you’ll have a more immersive experience if you have a grasp of the language. Being able to have clear conversations with the locals could help you find your way to some of the best hidden spots in the country.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/pexels-photo-286758-scaled.jpeg"                      alt="pexels photo 286758 scaled" title="Learn Croatian: 7 Reasons Why You Should Learn Croatian 2"                ></p><h3 id="3-Croatian-Food-is-Amazing"><a href="#3-Croatian-Food-is-Amazing" class="headerlink" title="3.

However, before you begin, it can be helpful to have a plan for success.</p><p><strong>1. Know Your Motivation</strong></p><p> It’s always good to know why you’re doing something. Much like any other pursuit, language learning is a process. There will be ups and downs, and during the rough moments, it will be easier to remain committed to the goal if you know why you’re doing this.</p><p><strong>2. Set a Study Schedule</strong></p><p> You don’t have to follow a strict schedule if that doesn’t work for you, but it’s good to have a basic idea of when you can fit in your language learning. Will you practice during the commute to work? Can you study on your lunch break or during your evening jog on the treadmill? You can likely squeeze language learning into your day in a number of ways. Making a list before you get started will help you create solid new habits for practice.</p><p><strong>3. Document Your Progress</strong></p><p> When it comes to challenges like language learning, it can be very helpful to celebrate your progress as you go. When you meet a big goal, like being able to speak a complete sentence, read a paragraph or hold a basic conversation, you should enjoy the glow of your success. Blogging or writing in a journal about these moments will give you a physical record you can examine if you get frustrated learning more advanced aspects of the language in the future.</p><p> You deserve the best in life, and if learning Croatian is something you desire, don’t put it off. Bettering yourself will expand your horizons in ways you can’t even imagine.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.mondly.com/blog/7-reasons-learn-croatian-amazing-foreign-languages/&t=Learn+Croatian:+7+Reasons+Why+You+Should+Learn+Croatian"  title="Share on Facebook">Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875" >Download Mondly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="Speak-Croatian-in-just-10-minutes-a-day"><a href="#Speak-Croatian-in-just-10-minutes-a-day" class="headerlink" title="Speak Croatian in just 10 minutes a day"></a>Speak Croatian in just 10 minutes a day</h3><p> Do you want to speak Croatian fluently fast?
