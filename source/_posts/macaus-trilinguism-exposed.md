## Macau’s Trilinguism Exposed

 **Macau’s language tapestry is a fascinating blend of Cantonese, Portuguese, and Macanese** —a Portuguese-based creole. This intriguing linguistic composition serves as a testament to the region’s rich historical background and cultural amalgamation. Once a Portuguese colony, the city of Macau is now officially known as the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China. As a result, the Macau language, with its harmonious combination of these languages, plays a vital role in shaping this city’s unique cultural personality.

 Nestled in the western Pearl River Delta by the South China Sea, Macau is a vibrant city home to approximately 680,000 inhabitants within a compact area of only 32.9 km2\. So it’s no surprise that it is one of**the most densely populated regions in the world.** Though, the most fascinating thing about Macau remains its special blend of Eastern and Western cultures that offer a unique cultural identity that cannot be found anywhere else on the planet.

 Ready to find our more about the rich linguistic mosaic of Macau? Read on to discover the intriguing history behind this captivating blend of languages.

## The History of Macau

 The current linguistic mosaic of Macau began taking shape almost 500 years ago. It all started in 1557, when**the Ming dynasty leased Macau to Portugal** as a trading post. Naturally, this marked the beginning of a significant Portuguese presence in Macau, introducing the Portuguese language and culture to the region.

 The subsequent union of the [Portuguese and Spanish](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) crowns from 1580 to 1640 further solidified Macau’s prominence as a major trading hub between Europe and the Far East. However, the establishment of a British trading post in nearby Hong Kong in 1750 brought about increased British influence, leading to disputes and a decline in Macau’s prominence as a trading center.

 Portugal continued to administer Macau until 1999, when sovereignty was transferred back to China.

 Today, Macau is a thriving gambling destination – often referred to as the “Las Vegas of the East” – with a degree of autonomy from Beijing and a gambling industry seven times larger than that of Las Vegas. The city is renowned for its high per capita incomes, ranking among the highest globally, and its impressive Human Development Index, which places it fourth worldwide in terms of life expectancy.

 Furthermore, approximately two-thirds of the city’s land area consists of reclaimed land from the sea, making the territory highly urbanized.

 Despite its tumultuous history, Macau is the perfect example of a happy ending.

## Multilingualism in Macau

 Now that you know the history behind it, the Macau linguistic heritage makes much more sense.

**The official languages of Macau are Chinese and Portuguese.** Given Macau’s history as a Portuguese colony, you’d think many people in Macau speak Portuguese. However, in reality, things are different and Portuguese is spoken by only 2.3% of the people.

**The most widely spoken language in Macau is Cantonese,** which is used in everyday life by over 85% of the population. It is the de facto Chinese dialect in Macau, with strong cultural assimilation and usage in personal interactions.

 **Other languages spoken in Macau include Mandarin, Macanese Portuguese, English and other Chinese variants.** English is usually spoken by those who are engaged in trade, commerce and tourism, while Mandarin is taught and used for official purposes and business dealings with mainland China.

 Interestingly enough, English and Mandarin speakers are more prevalent in Macau compared to Portuguese speakers. While Portuguese is the official of Macau, the British and Chinese cultures exercise a much greater influence on a global scale.

## Macanese: A Distinctive Creole Language of Macau

**Macanese Patois or the Macanese creole language, known as Patuá** to its speakers, is a mixture of Cantonese, Malay, Sinhalese, and – most importantly – Portuguese. Developed as a lingua franca for communication among the multicultural community of traders, sailors, and settlers, Macanse emerged as a unique language reflecting the melting pot of cultures that Macau represented.

 Known as the**“sunset creole of Macau”** , Macanese is mostly spoken by those of mixed heritage but is fading out among the younger generation. As a matter of fact, UNESCO’s [Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000187026) even classifies Patuá as a “critically endangered” language.

 The development of Macau’s signature language initially occurred primarily among the descendants of Portuguese settlers in Macau. Instead of marrying locals from neighboring China, they often married women from Portuguese Malacca, Portuguese India, and Portuguese Ceylon. This led to the language adopting notable influences from Malay and Sinhala. In the 17th century, Macanese underwent a further transformation when immigrants from other Portuguese colonies in Asia arrived.

 Even during the time when Macau was Portuguese territory, the usage of Macanese was already declining, and this trend is unlikely to change now that the territory is under Chinese administration. However, speakers of Macanese still hold a deep sense of pride in the fact that Macau has its unique local language.

## Portuguese in Macau: A Journey of 11,000 km

 The story of how Portuguese came to Macau and established its presence is truly captivating. While the number of Portuguese speakers in Macau may be small today, the Portuguese influence remains evident in various aspects of Macau’s culture. This influence is particularly noticeable in the legal and administrative sectors, as well as in place names, cuisine, and other cultural elements.

 Additionally, Macau boasts a vibrant Portuguese media presence, which encompasses three daily newspapers, one radio station, and a television channel.

 The linguistic connection between Macau and Portugal also results in significant movement between the two regions. According to the [2021 Macau Census](https://www.dsec.gov.mo/Censos2021/en-US/) , individuals born in Portugal make up around 0.3% of Macau’s total population, indicating a notable presence of Portuguese-born residents in Macau.

### Official Portuguese Usage in Macau

 Despite the relatively small number of Portuguese speakers in Macau, the local government remains committed to promoting the Portuguese language. In public schools, students are taught Chinese, English, and Portuguese, reflecting the importance of these languages in the education system. Additionally, the government offers free programs to facilitate the learning of Portuguese among the general population.

 In official government documents, both written Portuguese and written Chinese (traditional) are used. This dual-language approach demonstrates the recognition and value given to both languages in administrative matters. In daily life, it is common to come across signs and displays in Macau that feature written Chinese and written Portuguese. This parallel use of languages is similar to the coexistence of written Chinese and British English in Hong Kong.

## Cantonese: The Dominant Language of Macau

 Cantonese, a variant of the [Chinese language](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) , is spoken in Macau, Hong Kong, Southern China, as well as by Chinese communities in North America and Southeast Asian countries. While Cantonese is considered a dialect of Chinese, it is important to note that Mandarin and Cantonese are not mutually intelligible, meaning speakers of one may not understand the other.

 **Despite the city’s historical ties with Portugal, Cantonese firmly dominates the social, commercial, and educational landscapes of Macau.** Over 85% of people in Macau speak Cantonese.

 Cantonese serves as the primary medium of instruction in the majority of schools in Macau. Additionally, there are mandatory classes that focus on Mandarin, ensuring students have exposure to and proficiency in the official language of China.

## The Future of Macau’s Languages

 The future of Macau’s languages, particularly Macanese and Portuguese, is uncertain at this point. Their survival in Macau depends on preservation efforts and demographic shifts.

 In May 2012, the Public Administration and Civil Service Bureau of the Macau Special Administrative Region issued a circular emphasizing the equal importance of Chinese and Portuguese as the official languages of Macau. They urged public administrations to use both languages when releasing information to the public and requested that any existing information available in only one language be supplemented in the other language. Therefore, Portuguese in Macau seems to be safe for now as it is protected by law.

 As China’s influence continues to grow, there has also been a rise in the use of Mandarin. Still, Cantonese remains dominant. On the other hand, Macanese (Patuá), with its small number of speakers, is in danger of extinction. In order to safeguard this distinctive aspect of Macau’s cultural heritage, concerted efforts are said to be made to preserve and promote Macanese through various cultural events and initiatives.

### Is English widely spoken in Macau?

 English is not as widely spoken in Macau compared to Cantonese. However, due to Macau’s status as popular gambling destination, English is commonly understood and spoken. Many signs, menus, and information for tourists are also available in English. Additionally, English is taught as a compulsory subject in schools, contributing to a level of English proficiency among the younger generation.

### Are there any efforts to revitalize endangered languages in Macau?

 There are Macanese individuals who are actively engaged in revitalizing the language through various creative mediums such as literature, theater, and music. However, the success of language revival ultimately relies on the active participation of younger generations—the ones who will be responsible for carrying it forward into the mid-twenty-first century. Their involvement and commitment are crucial for the preservation and continued vitality of the Macanese language.
