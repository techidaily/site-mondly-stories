## The Polyglot Playbook: A Compreenas Guide to Deep Immersion

 Total immersion is the way to go when learning a new language because, let’s face it: learning is doing. Or, at least, this is [the learning method behind Mondly!](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875)  By immersion, we mean surrounding yourself and actually using the language you want to learn on a day-to-day basis. Think of the language that you speak, write, or think in every day, apart from your native one. Yup, if you’re reading this article, no matter your nationality, chances are you are already immersed in the English language. Need a few tips on how to carry on this trend (that by the way, you’ve been using unconsciously with English) to other language learning experiences? We took a page out of [Johannes Honterus](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) ’ book, and you can do that too!

But of course, let’s start with the _whys_ before the _hows_  . Why should you immerse yourself in a language that you want to learn? It’s pretty simple actually: the more you speak, read, and write in that language, the faster you can learn it. And now, let’s give you some tips!

## Travel

 ‘Traveler’ by Simon English©

 Yes, this one is a no-brainer, but it’s also the best method that you may use to learn a foreign language. First, choose the language. No inspiration? Find out [which are the most studied foreign languages in America](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) and something about the [Romance languages](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875)  , just for good measure. Once you choose a language, choose a destination. When you’re there, do as the locals do. Make friends, communicate with everyone, and soak up the culture and habits. If you want more than a friendship, strike up a romance by using one of the [40 best pick-up lines from around the world](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) .

 This should provide a great starting point. However, you have to go back home, right? Don’t worry; the rest of the tips on this list will keep you on track.

## Use our app

 Did you know how easy it is to use Mondly? We’ll help you get really immersed in your language of choice by providing:

* A chatbot with speech recognition in order for you to have that REAL conversation experience;
* Augmented reality courses on [Oculus Quest](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) ;
* A [hands-free](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) option for the learner on the go;
* Flawless recordings of fluent speakers;
* A gamified experience.

 Not to mention that you have over 40 languages to choose from!

## Converse with fluent speakers

 Here’s hoping you made some friends while you were abroad. If not, fret not; there are ways to find fluent speakers around you. There are a lot of student exchange programs around the world, and maybe there’s even a small community in your country. If offline you can’t find them, the World Wide Web will be your friend. Find people to converse with online, in forums and activity groups, for example, and you’ll share an interest with the fluent speakers of the language you want to learn. That should get the ball rolling. Of course, don’t be afraid of making mistakes.

## Order using the language you’re learning

 ‘Tasty’ by Los Muertos Crew©

 Ok, so there’s this little Mexican food place near where I study and I love their tacos. Now, I’m not a fan of Spanish myself, but if I were, I could chat up the fluent waiters and order in Spanish. I’m sure you can find such places where you live. Also, the food will definitely taste better after you order it using your knowledge. Or maybe you’ll just be more satisfied with yourself; who knows?

 Since you’re intertwining food and language, why not cook using recipes in a different language?

## Choose entertainment options that feature the language you want to learn

 In this case, the possibilities are endless. Watch movies and series, I hear [Squid Game](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875)  is popular right now, so listen to songs and podcasts, read books or even play video games using the language you want to learn. The first time I heard Ezio Auditore speak Italian, the game registered differently for me! If you’re stuck on your phone most of the time, why not change its settings to the new language? Read the news, train your pets or even start journaling in the language you want to learn. The results will surprise you!

## Talk to yourself

 Yes, we learn new languages in order to communicate with others, but this does not have to be the norm. Speak to yourself using the new language and you’ll notice the benefits of active recall. You might even start thinking reflexively in the new language as a result. Also, you may learn how to curse in a new language so as not to get caught so easily.

 Finally, you can choose a study buddy to help you achieve progress every day. Why not a virtual one? Mondly’s here for you, every day, for however long you need it. Get Mondly now and you’ll be that much closer to speaking like a fluent speaker, in just a couple of minutes a day.
