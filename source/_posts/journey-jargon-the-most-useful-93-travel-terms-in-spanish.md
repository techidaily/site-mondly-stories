## 1\. Greetings and other basic phrases – the magic Spanish words

The Latins are warm, friendly and very welcoming people, so don’t be surprised if they seem open to conversation. It’s an opportunity you want to take advantage of.

* _¡Buenos días!_ – Good morning!
* _¡Buenas tardes!_ – Good afternoon!
* _¡Buenas noches!_ – Good evening!
* _¡Hola!_ – Hi!
