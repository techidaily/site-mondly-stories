## When should you say you’re sorry?

 What you need to remember is that learning how to say “sorry” in German also has a cultural component. It’s not enough to learn how to say you’re sorry; you also have to learn_when_ to say you’re sorry. Unlike Americans and even Brits who apologize quite a lot,**Germans tend to keep their sorrys to a minimum.** In fact, they say sorry so rarely that they can come off as rude to people of other nationalities.

 However, this is not strictly a German thing. It’s true Germans say sorry once in a blue moon, but there are some other countries like France or Russia where over-apologizing can be regarded as insincere as well.

## How to apologize in German

_**Es tut mir leid**_ is the standard sorry or the apologetic sorry. It’s the kind of sorry you say when you messed up and you want to apologize for what you did. The expression conveys a sense of responsibility it is kind of a formal apology.

 If you want it to be more informal, you can say_**Tut mir leid**_ which is more similar to “sorry” than “I’m sorry”.

Here are some practical examples of apologies in German:

* _Es tut mir schrecklich leid!_ – I’m terribly sorry!
* _Sie haben Recht, das tut mir leid._  – You are right, I am sorry.
* _Tut mir leid, ich mag die Suppe nicht._ – Sorry, I don’t like the soup.

## How to say sorry in German – the “Excuse me” sorry

 If you bump into someone on the street or cause a mishap, the most common way to say “sorry” in German is_**Entschuldigung**_ which literally means “apology!”. This is basically the “sorry” or the “excuse me” you say for a minor inconvenience. In other words, we’re talking about a slight bump or barely touching that person. If you knock them over, a cool_Entschuldigung_ won’t do, so you should probably apologize sincerely.

 In case you need a more**formal sorry** for someone you don’t know or someone older, you should say**_Entschuldigen Sie._** For **informal situations,_Entschuldige_ works best** or you can use the abbreviated_**‘Tschuldigung**_ .

 Hear the formal_Entschuldigen Sie_ in action in this basic conversation in German:
