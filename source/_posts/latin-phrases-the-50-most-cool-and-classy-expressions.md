## Latin Phrases: The 50 Most Cool and Classy Expressions

 Far from being a dead language, Latin is very much alive in our day-to-day conversations._Carpe diem, et cetera, cum laude, curriculum vitae_ and_mea culpa_ are just a few of the Latin phrases still widely used today. It’s unclear whether Latin made a comeback or it has been this cool for hundreds of years. But one thing is sure: **Latin phrases are nowadays the cooler siblings of slang words.** And Julius Caesar approves this message. So, let’s see the most famous Latin phrases you can use to impress your friends.



## Famous Latin Phrases you need to know

These are nearly as famous as Julius Caesar himself.

### **Veni, vidi, vici. —** _I came, I saw, I conquered._

 Famously attributed to Julius Caesar in a message he supposedly sent to the Roman Senate to describe his swift, conclusive victory against King Pharnaces II of Pontus near Zela in 47 BC.

### **Alea iacta est. —** _The die has been cast._

 Another Latin phrase said by Julius Caesar upon crossing the Rubicon to enter Italy and begin the long civil war against Pompey and the Optimates. The meaning of this phrase refers to the point of no return.

### **Carpe diem. —** _Seize the day._

 Probably the most popular Latin phrase of modern times. Luckily, we have an even better one:_carpe vinum_ . Literally ‘seize the wine’. The only Latin phrase you’ll ever need on a Friday night out. And speaking of night, you should also remember the_carpe noctem_ variation which literally translates to ‘seize the night’. Either way, the general meaning is to make the most of everything.

### **Cogito, ergo sum. —** _I think, therefore I am._

 A_dictum_ (‘a short statement that expresses a general truth’) coined by French philosopher René Descartes in Latin.

 What Descartes doesn’t know is that nowadays people prefer the_bibo, ergo sum_ version which literally means “I drink, therefore I am”.

### **In vino veritas. —_In wine, there is truth._**

 Be careful if you_carpe vinum_ on that Friday night out we talked about. This Latin saying suggests that you’ll probably spill all your secrets if you drink too much alcohol.

### **Et tu, Brute? —** _“And you, Brutus?”_

 Or “You too, Brutus?”. This Latin quote appears in William [Shakespeare](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) ‘s play “Julius Caesar” at the very moment of Caesar’s assassination. Upon recognizing his friend, Marcus Junius Brutus, as one of the assassins, Julius Caesar utters these last words.

 That scene is very tragic indeed, but nowadays, the phrase can be used jokingly to condemn a friend’s change of heart.

### **Acta, non verba. —** _Deeds, not words._

 Similar to_res, non verba_ , the English equivalent of this phrase is “actions speak louder than words”. In other words, act upon it or always follow your declarations with actions.

### **Carthago delenda est. —** _Carthage must be destroyed._

 Prior to the Third Punic War between Rome and Carthage, Cato the Censor, a Roman politician, used to conclude all his speeches to the Senate with this phrase. While he did this in an attempt to push for the war, nowadays the expression can be used figuratively as a way to express your absolute support for an idea.

## Common Latin Words & Sayings

* **Ad hominem —** _To the person_

 Short for_argumentum ad hominem_ (literally meaning ‘argument against the person’). It refers to a rhetorical strategy where the speaker attacks the other person rather than the substance of the argument itself.

* **Quid pro quo —** _Something for something_

 Or ‘this for that’. A favor granted in return for something else. Similar to “you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours”.

* **Deus ex machina —** _God from the machine_

 A plot device used to resolve a seemingly unsolvable problem. It’s often considered a lazy or cheap way to tie loose ends in movies or books. A good example could be Arya killing the Night King in Game of Thrones.

* **Ad hoc —** _For this_

 Or ‘for this purpose. Something that is not planned, but done only when it’s needed. An_ad hoc_ meeting.

* **Mea culpa —** _Through my fault_

An acknowledgment of one’s fault or an admission of guilt.

* **Status quo —** _The existing state (of affairs)_

 Mainly used with regard to social or political issues. “The officials wanted to maintain the status quo, so they did not vote to admit the new members.

* **Per se** (and not ‘per say’) —_By itself or in itself_

 Used to describe or talk about something on its own, rather than in connection with other things. “I’m not a fan of the Latin language per se, but rather its influence on modern languages.”

* **Alma mater —** _Nourishing mother_

 Used to identify the institution of education that one formerly attended. It suggests that a school provides intellectual nourishment to its students.

* **De facto —** _In fact_

 Describes something existing in fact, although perhaps not legal. It contrasts with_de jure_ , which refers to things that happen according to law.

* **Persona non grata —** _An unwelcome person_

 Especially used in diplomacy, but also in day-to-day conversations. “Julian is a persona non grata for us since he offended Miriam.

* **Bona fide —** _In good faith_

 If something was made_bona fide_ , then it is sincere, genuine or authentic.

* **Sui generis —** _Of its/his/her/their own kind_

Constituting a class alone. Unique. Think of Mozart for example.

* **Sine qua non —** _Without which, not_

 Something absolutely essential. A more clear translation could be ‘without (something), (something else) won’t be possible’. “Creativity is a sine qua non for writing novels.”

* **Ad infinitum —** _To infinity_

Unlike the previous Latin words, this one is pretty self-explanatory.

* **Et cetera —** _And other similar things_

Every student’s favorite. We all know what this one means, don’t we?

They’re evergreen. If time travel gets invented in a few years,[these phrases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List%5Fof%5FLatin%5Fphrases%5F%28full%29) are gonna come in handy regardless of the century you choose to travel to. Besides, this selection includes only the most relevant expressions so you don’t have to worry about redundancy.

Get ready to bring your Roman alter ego to life in 3… 2… 1\. Go!

* **Castigat ridendo mores.** — _Laughing corrects morals._

 According to this phrase, one supposedly corrects bad habits by laughing at them. Of course, you shouldn’t laugh at strangers, but your close friends will probably like the idea.

* **Cui bono?** —_Good for whom?_

 Or who benefits? Similar to the expression_sequere pecuniam_ (“follow the money”), this phrase suggests to look for the culprit in the person who would benefit from an unwelcome event.

* **Me vexat pede.** — _It annoys me at the foot._

 Similar to the English saying “a pebble in one’s shoe”,_me vexat pede_ refers to a trivial situation or person that is being a nuisance. The Romans don’t seem so serious anymore, do they?

* **Mulgere hircum.** — _To milk a male goat._

 Am I wrong or is this your soon to be favorite Latin phrase? Although it hints at attempting the impossible – which is a very serious matter – you can not help but smile at the image.

* **Ex nihilo nihil fit.** — _Nothing comes from nothing._

 Or so Lucretius said. Originally meaning “work is required to succeed”, the modern reinterpretation suggests that “everything has its origins in something”.

 “Laughing” by Peter Lloyd©

* **Nemo saltat sobrius.** —_Nobody dances sober._

 Have you heard about Cicero? The famous Roman statesman, lawyer, scholar, philosopher and Academic Skeptic? Well, he said this. Probably after an interesting night during which_carpe vinum_ was his favorite motto.

* **Nitimur in vetitum.** — _We strive for the forbidden._

 From Ovid’s ‘Amores’. This behavior is no stranger to the modern world. Highly disputed between philophers,_nitimur in vetitum_ was also what drove Eve to take a bite from the forbidden fruit.

* **Caesar non supra grammaticos.** — _The Emperor is not above the grammarians._

 Know any grammar nazis? Because they’ll love this Latin phrase. Its origin goes back to 1414, when the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg made a grammar mistake during his speech to the Council of Constance. After the error was pointed out to him, Sigismund angrily decided to simply change the grammar rule to his liking. At his point, a member of the Council apparently stood and said “Caesar non supra grammaticos”. Pretty cool story, isn’t it?

* **Pecunia non olet.** — _Money don’t smell._

 According to Suetonius, when to Roman emperor Vespasian imposed a urine tax, his son Titus complained of the money’s disgusting nature. Now you’re probably asking yourself what in heaven’s name is a urine tax. Well, the urine collected from Rome’s public urinals was sold as an ingredient for multiple chemical processes. So no, the people of Rome didn’t pay a tax to urinate. Instead, the buyers of the urine did.

 You can probably imagine what happened next. Vespasian’s answer to his son was to hold up a gold coin and ask whether it smelled. The rest is… history.

* **Plenus venter non studet libenter.** — _A full belly does not like studying._

 To be honest, my belly does not like studying when it’s empty either. What about yours?

 Anyway, it seems that the Romans believed it is difficult to concentrate after a heavy meal.

 Et tu, Brute?  Et tu, Brute?90 (9.18 %)

 Quid pro quo.  Quid pro quo.77 (7.86 %)

* **Festina lente.** — _Hurry slowly._

 An oxymoronic phrase attributed to Augustus. Genius if you ask me. Equivalent to “more haste, less speed”,_festina lente_ essentially encourages you to proceed quickly, but cautiously.

* **Barba non facit philosophum.** — _A beard doesn’t make one a philosopher._

 Want to sweep everyone off their feet with your erudite ways? Use this Latin phrase instead of its English equivalent: “clothes don’t make the man”. Or the similar_cucullus non facit monachum_ (“the hood does not make the monk”).

* **De gustibus non est disputandum.** — _Of tastes there is nothing to be disputed._

Different phrase, same story. You’re welcome.

* **Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes.** — _I fear Greeks even if they bring gifts._

 Similar to_equo ne credite_ (“do not trust the horse”). The phrase belongs to Laocoön when he supposedly warned his fellow Trojans against accepting the wooden horse from the Greeks. Nowadays, this expression can be used figuratively between friends.

* **Dulce est desipere in loco.** — _It is sweet on occasion to play the fool. / It is pleasant to relax once in a while._

 By Horace in ‘Odes’. Criminally underused genius Latin phrase. I trust you shall change this.

* **Audentes fortuna iuvat.** —_Fortune favors the bold._

 Supposedly Pliny the Elder’s last words before leaving the docks at Pompeii to rescue his friend Pomponianus from the eruption of Vesuvius in 79\. The phrase also appears in Virgil’s Aeneid.

* **Ita vero.** —_Thus indeed._

 Funny thing about Romans. Apparently, they had no word for ‘yes’, so they went with_ita vero_ instead.

* **Lupus in fabula.** —_The wolf in the story._

 The Latin equivalent of “speak of the devil”. When you speak of someone and they suddenly appear, almost as if you were summoning them, this proverb is perfect.

* **Memento vivere.** —_Remember to live._

 We all heard about_memento mori_ (“remember that you \[have to\] die”), but apparently a more optimistic view over life also existed.

* **Risus abundat in ore stultorum.** —_Laughter is abundant in the mouth of fools._

 Similar to_per risum multum poteris cognoscere stultum_ (“by excessive laughter one can recognize the fool”). Do you have that one friend who laughs at their own jokes even before saying them? If yes, then this saying is for them. Only if they are not easily offended, of course.

* **Surdo oppedere.** —_To belch before the deaf._

 You gotta love the Latin language. After learning of this phrase’s existence, I no longer regarded my attempt to learn as many Latin phrases as possible as futile.

 If it wasn’t obvious enough,_surdo oppedere_ refers to a useless action.

* **Aut Caesar aut nihil.** —_Either Caesar or nothing._

 Or “all or nothing”. This was the personal motto of the infamous Italian cardinal Cesare Borgia. Nowadays, the expression can be used to denote the absolute aspiration to be the best.

* **Mortuum flagellas.** —_You are flogging a dead man._

 Have you ever criticized someone who did not feel remorse over their actions? This phrase is exactly about that but said in a much more creative and interesting way. Gotta remember this one.

## Latin Words and Phrases for Love

 To conclude our exploration of the Latin phrases in a positive tone, let’s see what the Romans had to say about love. It’s true they talked more about wars, but you don’t need that kind of negativity in your life, do you? Why [learn Latin phrases](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) about war, when love wins no matter what?

* **Si vis amari ama.** —_If you want to be loved, love._

 Written by Seneca in the sixth of his letters to Lucilius. The phrase has a double interpretation: ‘only loving souls can inspire love’ and ‘you cannot ask for love from those you do not love yourself’.

* **Amor vincit omnia.** —_Love conquers all._

 Famously attributed to the Latin poet Virgil, this popular Latin phrase is also the title of a painting by the Italian Baroque artist Caravaggio.

* **Ubi amor, ibi dolor.** —_Where (there is) love, there (is) pain._

 No matter how beautiful, love can also hurt. This expression refers to the pain love can inflict upon one’s soul especially if we’re talking about unrequited love.

* **Amor et melle et felle est fecundissimus.** —_Love is rich with both honey and venom._

 It seems that love was no different in Ancient Rome. This quote appeared in Titus Maccius Plautus’ play ‘Cistellaria’.

* **Hei mihi! Quod nullis amor est medicabilis herbis.** —_Oh me! Love can not be cured by herbs._

From Ovid’s ‘Metamorphoses’. We know your pain, Ovid.

### Why should you learn these cool Latin phrases?

 In all seriousness, Latin phrases, words and sayings are a fun way to boost your vocabulary and learn more about the origin of the words we use every day. While Latin is the common ancestor of the Romance languages, it has also influenced the Germanic languages (of which English is a part). So it might prove most illuminating to take inspiration from the master orators and use Latin words and phrases in your day-to-day conversations.

 Besides, Latin can prepare you for many professions or simply discussions with scholarly people. These fields include law, medicine, science, music, theology, philosophy, art, and literature. Many scholars believe that learning Latin also sharpens the mind and cultivates analysis and attention.

 Furthermore, the Latin language is rich in life lessons, mottos and words to live by. By learning these sayings, you’ll not only improve your vocabulary but also your life experience.

### Why are Latin words used in law?

 Latin words are used in law because of the historical influence Roman law has on the legal system of many countries. As the lingua franca of the Roman Empire, Latin not only shaped the empire's legal constructs but also left a lasting imprint on the evolution of legal systems, especially within Europe. As Roman law became the foundation for many modern legal codes, Latin legal words were passed on throughout history until the present day. This incorporation of Latin words in law ensures a degree of precision and continuity, bridging legal concepts across different eras and jurisdictions.

### Why are Latin words powerful?

 Latin words are perceived as powerful most probably in relation to the Roman Empire, a civilization of immense historical influence and achievement. Additionally, Latin words may be considered powerful thanks to their ability to convey complex legal, scientific, and philosophical concepts succinctly. Their use in various specialized fields has endowed them with a sense of authority and timelessness, allowing for clear and unambiguous communication across different languages and cultures.

 In conclusion, dropping one or two cool Latin words here and there will add at least 50 points to your coolness level. Even the dullest conversation can become an erudite discussion if you use the right Latin sayings. However, you should avoid using popular Latin phrases _ad nauseam_ (’to a sickening or excessive degree’) in your discourse. While they may impress your friends (and foes) if used mindfully, the contrary can also be true if you’re too overzealous.
