 Did you work hard to [learn a new language](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) ? It might be time for you to have your newly acquired language skills officially recognized. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the importance of language exams and certifications, offering insights into their benefits and top-rated exams across different languages. Let’s dive into the world of language exams and unlock your language potential.



## Overview of Language Exams/Tests

 Language exams or tests are structured assessments designed to measure an individual’s language proficiency. They**evaluate skills in reading, writing, listening, and speaking,** providing a comprehensive evaluation of one’s language abilities.

 These exams serve multiple purposes, such as determining language competency for educational admissions, job applications, or immigration requirements. By offering standardized assessments, language exams provide a common benchmark for assessing language skills, ensuring consistency and comparability across different contexts.

### Language Proficiency Scales

 Language proficiency scales help to measure how effectively a language user can perform different types of language tasks. In other words – how well you know the language.

 The most commonly used language proficiency scales are the ACTFL scale and the ILR scale for Americans, and the CEFR scale for Europeans.

* **IRL scale** (Interagency Language Roundtable scale)**:** Developed by the United States Foreign Service Institute as a reference for language proficiency in federal government roles, the ILR scale consists of five levels: elementary proficiency (S-1), limited working proficiency (S-2), professional working proficiency (S-3), full professional proficiency (S-4), and native or bilingual proficiency (S-5).
* **ACTFL scale** (American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages scale)**:** Derived from the IRL scale, it provides a more detailed assessment of language proficiency. The ACTFL scale retains the five-level structure but uses different terms: novice, intermediate, advanced, superior, and distinguished. What sets it apart is the inclusion of low, medium, and high sub-levels within the first four proficiency levels, offering a more precise evaluation of language skills.
* **CEFR scale** (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages scale)**:** The CEFR scale consists of six levels grouped into three categories: basic user (A), independent user (B), and proficient user (C). Each category is further divided into two sub-levels: A1 and A2, B1 and B2, and C1 and C2\. If your goal is to work in Europe or gain admission to a European institution that emphasizes language proficiency, the CEFR scale is the recommended framework to demonstrate your language skills.

## Top 10 Language Exams/Tests

### 1\. English: PTE

 **Pearson Test of English [(PTE)](https://www.pearsonpte.com/)**  is a computer-based English language exam that assesses non-native English speakers’ reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills. PTE provides secure English language testing for study applications worldwide and for visa applications for work and migration in Australia, the UK, New Zealand, and Canada. The exam is known for its innovative test format and quick result turnaround time.

 There are multiple types of PTE tests you can take depending on your needs:

* **PTE Academic:** Accepted by over 3,200 institutions for ​studies globally, PTE Academic is the perfect choice if you need an English certification for studying in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Canada, or the US. Some of the biggest universities that accept PTE Academic include Harvard Business School and Yale.
* **PTE Academic UKVI:** The only difference to PTE Academic is that this test is approved for most UK work visas and studying at below degree level. Thus, this is the perfect test for studying and migrating to the UK.
* **PTE Core:** This is a new test that assesses everyday English (not academic English), and at the moment, it is the best option for migration and work visas for Canada. Already in Canada? Don’t worry! It is approved for permanent residency, too!
* **PTE Home:** This is a 30-minute test that assesses your English level for migration to the UK and some work visas.

 In addition, Pearson also has a PTE Academic Test Prep to help you practice for the real English language test.

### 2\. Spanish: DELE

**DELE** stands for_Diplomas de Español como Lengua Extranjera,_ meaning Diplomas of Spanish as a Foreign Language.

 DELE are official diplomas the Spanish**Instituto Cervantes** grants on behalf of the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science. These certificates are awarded to individuals who have successfully passed a standardized test demonstrating their proficiency in**European Spanish.**

 The DELE Spanish language exam has been designed following the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFRL) guidelines. As a result, the exam offers six versions, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your level: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2\. All DELE versions evaluate reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills.

 Unlike other language exams,**the DELE certification never expires.**

### 3\. French: DELF and DALF

**DELF** (_Diplôme d’Études en Langue Française,_ meaning Diploma in French Language Studies) is an official certification of French language proficiency for non-native speakers. France Education International administers it on behalf of France’s Ministry of Education.

 The DELF consists of four diplomas corresponding to the first four levels of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: A1, A2, B1, and B2\. For higher proficiency levels, the**DALF** (_Diplôme Approfondi de Langue Française_ meaning Diploma in Advanced French Language Studies) is awarded.

 Widely recognized by educational institutions and employers, the**DELF and DALF are lifelong certifications that don’t expire,** providing long-term validity and recognition of your French language skills.

### 4\. German: Goethe-Zertifikat or TestDaF

**Goethe-Zertifikat** is the official German language exam administered by the**Goethe-Institut.** Universities and employers in German-speaking countries widely recognize it as a measure of German language proficiency. The exam assesses reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills, providing a comprehensive evaluation of German language abilities. The Goethe-Institut offers multiple Goethe-Zertifikat exams that align with the CEFR levels, spanning from A1 for beginners to C2 for advanced learners.

 Another popular option for German certification is**TestDaF,** which stands for_Test Deutsch als Fremdsprache_ (Test of German as a Foreign Language). TestDaF is an advanced-level language exam that covers levels B2 to C1 on the CEFR scale. Successfully completing all four sections of the TestDaF exam at level 4 grants a certificate demonstrating the language proficiency required for admission to various subjects and degree programs at German universities and higher education institutions. TestDaF is recognized worldwide, serving as evidence of your German language proficiency for research projects and academic pursuits.

 Neither Goethe-Zertifikat nor TestDaF has an expiration date. However, it is common for institutions and employers to prefer certificates that are no older than two years.

### 5\. Korean: TOPIK

**TOPIK** (Test of Proficiency in Korean) is a written examination designed to assess the language skills of non-native speakers of Korean.

 The TOPIK test evaluates proficiency in reading, writing, and listening comprehension in the Korean language. It consists of two levels: TOPIK-I and TOPIK-II. TOPIK-I, the beginner level, is further divided into sublevels 1 and 2, while TOPIK-II, the intermediate-advanced level, has sublevels 3, 4, 5, and 6\. Test takers receive a level between 1 and 6 based on their total score on the test.

 The TOPIK test is conducted six times a year. Three sessions are held exclusively in Korea (January, May, and November), while the other three sessions are conducted both in Korea and overseas (April, July, and October). In most countries, the TOPIK-I test is administered in the morning, followed by the TOPIK-II test in the afternoon. This allows test takers to take both TOPIK-I and TOPIK-II on the same day if desired.

 The validity of TOPIK certificates is two years from the date of test results issued.

### 6\. Mandarin Chinese: HSK

**HSK** stands for_Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi_ (汉语水平考试), meaning “Chinese Proficiency Test”. It is a series of exams designed to evaluate non-native speakers’ Mandarin Chinese language proficiency. The HSK comprises six individual tests, each corresponding to a different proficiency level. Upon successfully passing a specific level, you will receive HSK certification, ranging from HSK1 (easiest) to HSK6 (most challenging).

 Unlike other internationally-recognized language tests, the HSK focuses solely on written proficiency and does not assess speaking skills. If you wish to certify your spoken Chinese proficiency, you will need to take a separate exam called**HSKK** _(Hanyu Shuiping Kouyu Kaoshi)_ , also known as the “Chinese Proficiency Spoken Test”. The HSKK evaluates learners’ pronunciation, tones, clarity, continuity, variety, and fluency in spoken Chinese.

 The**HSK certificate does not have an expiration date** and remains valid indefinitely. However, for academic purposes, such as applying to a Chinese university, the certificate is typically accepted for a period of two years from the date of the exam. After this period, you may be required to retake the HSK to provide a more recent certification.

### 7\. Italian: CELI

**CELI** –_The Certificato di Conoscenza della Lingua Italiana_ (Certificate of Knowledge of Italian Language) is an internationally recognized qualification for assessing the fluency of non-native Italian speakers. It is administered by the University for Foreigners of Perugia.

 In addition to the standard CELI certifications, specialized versions are available: CELI Immigrati, designed for foreign citizens who have immigrated to Italy, including those with limited education, and CELI Adolescenti, aimed at children between the ages of 13 and 17.

 The CELI exams are aligned with the CEFR levels and are divided into six levels: CELI Impatto (CEFR Level A1), CELI 1 (CEFR Level A2), CELI 2 (CEFR Level B1), CELI 3 (CEFR Level B2), CELI 4 (CEFR Level C1), and CELI 5 (CEFR Level C2).

 The Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) recognizes CELI 3 as a valid certificate for Italian language proficiency required for university studies in Italy. CELI 4 and CELI 5 indicate an equivalent level of Italian language knowledge to that of Italian students.

**CELI certificates do not have an expiration date** and remain valid indefinitely, providing a lasting testament to your Italian language skills.

 The TORFL exam consists of six different levels that align with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR): TEL, TBL, TORFL-I, TORFL-II, TORFL-III, and TORFL-IV. Each level represents a specific degree of proficiency in Russian.

 The exam evaluates various language competencies through five sections: writing, vocabulary/grammar, reading, listening, and speaking. Typically, the exam is conducted over a two-day period. To pass the exam, a minimum score of 66% is required in each subtest. If a test taker scores below 66% in any subtest, they can retake that specific subtest for an additional fee (50% of the exam cost).

 The JLPT is categorized into five levels: N1, N2, N3, N4, and N5, with N5 being the easiest and N1 the most advanced. Each level assesses Japanese language skills relevant to that specific level. N4 and N5 focus on fundamental Japanese knowledge typically acquired in a classroom setting, while N1 and N2 test the understanding in various real-life situations. N3 bridges the N4/N5 and N1/N2 levels, combining elements from both.

 Obtaining a JLPT certification brings several advantages, such as academic credit recognition, favorable consideration in job applications, and overall acknowledgment of language proficiency in society.

**The JLPT certificate never expires.**

### 10\. Portuguese: CAPLE

**CAPLE** (_Centro de Avaliação de Português Língua Estrangeira_ or Centre for Evaluation of Portuguese as a Foreign Language) is a certification that assesses proficiency in Standard European Portuguese as a second language.

 Depending on the level, the CAPLE exam is broken into either four or five parts: reading comprehension, written production and interaction, oral comprehension, oral production and interaction, and structural competence (which is for B2, C1, and C2 only).

**CAPLE certificates/diplomas do not expire over time.**

## Tips for Language Exam Preparation

 Are you ready to ace your language certification? Let’s look at some tips for language exam preparation. Even if your language level is very good, preparing for a language exam is crucial. For example, doing a couple of sample tests can greatly improve your chances of success.

### **Set your goal**

 To begin, identify the desired level of proficiency or score you wish to achieve and establish realistic goals for each language skill. This approach will help you prioritize your study efforts and effectively monitor your progress.

### **Study the exam format**

 Familiarize yourself with the structure and sections of the test so you don’t get surprised on the spot. Make sure you know all the question types and tasks you will encounter in each section and the allocated time limits for each.

### **Understand the exam criteria**

 Find out what every section is worth! Understanding the scoring criteria and proficiency levels the exam assesses is more important than you think. Will they evaluate your reading, writing, listening, speaking, vocabulary, and grammar skills?

### **Establish a study plan**

 Create a well-structured study schedule with dedicated time for each language skill: speaking, listening, writing, etc. Use diverse study materials, such as [language learning apps](https://app.adjust.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-8270&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-8270&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-8270) , textbooks, online resources, and practice tests, to ensure a comprehensive learning experience.

### **Practice with sample tests**

 This is probably the most important step in your preparation. The internet is full of sample tests for all the popular language exams. Ensure you do as many as possible (under timed conditions) to get familiar with the language exam you’re about to take. Practice makes perfect!

### **Practice speaking and listening**

 If you’re one who gets nervous during an exam, allocate dedicated time to practice active listening and speaking to get confident. Mental blocks are more likely to happen when you’re put on the spot during listening and speaking exercises.

### **Review and recap**

 Repetition is the key to learning. That’s why you must regularly review your learning material to reinforce your knowledge. If it’s too time-consuming, make summaries and review those!

### **Focus on the gaps**

 Do you have any knowledge gaps? Is there anything you keep getting wrong in sample tests? Work on strengthening these gaps to ensure a well-rounded proficiency. Focusing on your weaknesses will enable you to address them effectively and enhance your overall language proficiency.

 Prepping for success in language exams is ultimately easy if you stay organized and practice as much as possible. But remember, a positive mindset can make all the difference!

## How to Choose the Right Language Exam/Test for You

 Choosing the right language exam/test for you depends on a lot of things. What are your expectations? What is the language you want to assess? When making your choice, make sure you completely understand what’s your purpose with this certification. Fortunately, there are enough language proficiency tests to choose from. All you have to do is weigh the options. Here are some factors to consider when deciding which language test to take.

* **Your purpose:** What do you need this language certification for? Academic purposes, employment, immigration, or personal development? By choosing the test that aligns with your objectives, you can ensure that you take the most relevant and beneficial examination for your language proficiency.
* **The language:** You’ll obviously need to choose a test that matches the language you want to evaluate.

Does any one of them sound good to you?
* **Recognition:** Find out if the test you want to take is recognized by the educational institutions, employers, or immigration authorities in the region or country you are targeting.
* **Proficiency level:** Before taking a language test, it’s important to determine your current language proficiency level. Most language tests assess users across multiple proficiency levels. By understanding your current level, you can identify the appropriate test that matches your skills and abilities. So make sure you figure out what’s your level.

![language tests](https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/language-tests-960x640.jpg "Language Exams And Certifications: Your Path To Proficiency 11")

* **Exam format and criteria:** To make an informed decision, it’s crucial to review the format, structure, and criteria of the language test to ensure it suits your strengths. Is the test computer-based, includes written or oral components, or follows a different format? Consider your comfort level with each format and choose the one that best suits your abilities. This will allow you to approach the test with confidence and perform at your best.
* **Timing and location:** Before committing to a language test, check the availability of test centers and dates in your location. Make sure you have enough time left to prepare before the date you choose.
* **Budget:** Is the test you chose within your budget? If not, consider switching to a less popular language exam. You’d be surprised to find out that some language exams offer the same benefits for less money.
* **Ask for advice:** If you’re still unsure, consider consulting with language teachers or professionals in your field who can help you make the best choice based on your specific circumstances.

 Does your desired language exam meet your conditions? Then it is a good choice. Now let’s move on to some frequently asked questions about language exams.
