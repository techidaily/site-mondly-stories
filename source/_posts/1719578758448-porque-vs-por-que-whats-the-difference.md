## Porque vs Por Que: What’s the Difference?

**_Porque_** vs**_por que_** and**_porqué_** vs **_por qué_ :** the real Clash of the Titans, the ultimate mystery of our world. What’s the difference and how do you correctly use all these_p_ _orques_ in Spanish? Well, buckle up because today you are finally going to find out and, most importantly, glue into your brain for eternity, the answers you’ve been looking for.

 Essentially, **_porque, por que, porqué_ and_por qué_**  are all**pronounced the same** (with some minor differences related to emphasis), but they mean totally different things. While**_porque_** translates to**“because”** ,**_por que_** translates to**“for which”** , **_el_ _porqué_**  to**“the reason”** and**_por qué_** to**“why”** . It’s obviously incredibly easy to change the whole meaning of a sentence with a single misplaced **[Spanish accent](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) .**

 If you are an English speaker, you know that’s not new. We also have our struggles with “your” and “you’re”, “whose” and “who’s”, “these” and “this”. Even if you know English to perfection, sometimes your brain just goes blank and you don’t know what’s the correct form anymore. But the [**_porque, por que, porqué_ and_por qué_**  problem](https://www.rae.es/espanol-al-dia/porque-porque-por-que-por-que-0) seems even more complicated than that. So read on to discover rules, eloquent examples in Spanish and the correct**Spanish pronunciation** for each situation.

## 1\. Por qué – how to ask**“** why?” in Spanish

 Let’s start with the two most common _porques:**por qué**_   **and_porque_ – “why?” and “because”** – the question and the answer.

 Although you may be confused right now with all these versions of – basically – the same word, this**_por qué_** will always be written in two words and an accent over “e” when you want to ask a question:**“why?”.** Let’s add the distinctive Spanish question marks and see some examples:

* _**¿Por qué** no vienes?_ –**“Why** aren’t you coming?”
* _**¿Por qué** no comes el pastel?_ –**“Why** aren’t you eating the cake?”
* _**¿Por qué** no aprendes español con Mondly?_ –**“Why** don’t you learn Spanish with Mondly?”
* _**¿Por qué** lees libros en español?_ –**“Why** do you read books in Spanish?”

 Now let’s see some examples where**_por qué_** is used as a reported or indirect question. Here are some examples to help you understand better:

* _Me preguntó**por qué** no leo libros en español._ – “He asked me**why** I did not read Spanish books.”
* _No sé**por qué** rechazaste la oferta._ – “I don’t know**why** you refused the offer.”
* _Quiero saber**por qué** está tan feliz._ – “I want to know**why** he/she is so happy.”

## 2\. Porque – “because” or how to give reasons in Spanish

 As you already know, whenever you ask “why?” in English, the other person will probably begin their answer using “because”. Well, Spanish has the same rules: whenever you ask someone**“por qué”,** they will probably begin their answer with the plain and simple**“porque”** with no spaces and no accents. Let’s see some examples:

* _**¿Por qué** no vienes a la fiesta?**Porque** estoy cansado._ – “Why are you not coming to the party?**Because** I’m tired.”
* _**¿Por qué** estás tan feliz?**Porque me** voy de vacaciones mañana._ – “Why are you so happy?**Because** I’m going on vacation tomorrow.”
* _**¿Por qué** me llamaste?**Porque** necesitaba tu ayuda._  – “Why did you call me?**Because** I needed your help.”
* _**Porque** quiero mejorar mi español._ – “**Because** I want to improve my Spanish.”

 In other cases,**“because”** and**“porque”**  can become the subordinating conjunctions that link two clauses: the reason and the result. Let’s see some examples to help you better understand:

* _No llegué a tiempo**porque** perdí el tren._ – “I didn’t make it on time**because** I missed the train.”
* _No me uní a la clase**porque** estoy aprendiendo español más rápido con Mondly._  – “I didn’t join the class**because** I’m learning Spanish faster with Mondly.”

 Well, this was the easy part of the great mystery behind **p_orque_ vs_por que_ .** Lucky for those of us who want to**learn Spanish,** the simplest_porques_ are also the most frequently used.

 But it’s always better to be safe and learn all the possible outcomes than learn only half of them and feel sorry afterwars. So let’s move on to the more problematic_porques:_ **_por que_ (for which)** and **_el porqué_ (the reason)_._**

## 3\. Por que – “For which”

 The knottiest of the four_porques_ is definitely the**_por que_** that translates to**“for which”.** Even in English we rarely use this word arrangement in a sentence.

 Let’s look at “this is the jacket for which I was looking”. That doesn’t sound exactly natural, does it? A more logical way to express the same information would be “this is the jacket I was looking for”. But Spanish can’t end a sentence with a preposition. So let’s explore the two situations where you’ll need to use**“por que”.**

* _Esta es la razón**por que** no vine._ – “This is the reason**for which** I didn’t come.”
* _Cual es el motivo**por que** te has ido?_ – “What is the reason**for which** you left?”

 While in the original Spanish sentence_la razón por que_ can be replaced with_por la que / por la cual,_ in the English translation, “the reason why” can always take the place of “the reason for which”. Same goes for the second example:_el motivo por que_ can be replaced with_el motivo por el que / por el cual._ In day-to-day conversations in Spanish, people are more likely to use the more natural forms:**_por la/el que, por la/el cual._**

 Another possible situation where you’ll need to use**_por que_** is when you’ll have phrasal verbs like_abogar por_ (advocate for),_preocupar por_ (worry about)‌ or_luchar por_ (fight for) followed by “que”.

* _Yo estoy preocupada**por que** el vuelo pueda cancelarse._ – “I’m worried that the flight might be cancelled.”
* _La profesora aboga**por que** los alumnos no lleven deberes a casa._ – “The teacher advocates that students should not receive homework.”
* _Mi abuela se preocupa**por que** comamos bien._ – “My grandmother worries about our nutrition.”
* La sociedad luchó**por que** las mujeres pudiesen votar. – “Society fought for women’s suffrage.”

Well, now it’s all starting to make sense, doesn’t it?

## 4\. El porqué – The reason

 Bare with me. This is the last**“porqué”** and the easiest**“porqué”.**

**_El porqué_** usually translates to**“the reason”,** but it can also mean**“why”** – used as a noun. Here’s an example from [Simon Sinek](https://simonsinek.com/find-your-why/) : “Everybody has a WHY. Do you know yours?”. In Spanish, that would translate to “Todos tienen un PORQUÉ. ¿Conoces el tuyo?”. Here are a few more examples with **_el porqué_ :**

* _El quería saber más sobre**los porqués** de mi partida._ – He wanted to know more about**the reasons** for my departure.
* _Todo tiene**un porqué.**_  – Everything has a reason.
* _Este buen clima es**el porqué** de mi felicidad._ – This nice weather is**the reason** for my happiness.
* _¿Cuál es**el porqué** de su elección?_ – “What is**the reason** of your choice?”

 Officially, **the four_porques_**  are no longer a mystery for you. Yey!
