## The meaning behind the days of the week in Korean

 If you are a fan of BTS, Squid Game, or K-drama in general, it’s possible that some of the Korean weekdays sound familiar to you. However, to make sure they are completely glued into your brain, we are going to look at how these words were formed. Studying the etymology of a word or its formation can help you make associations and remember it faster. This little trick applies to any language, not just Korean.

 As you can see, all days in Korean end in**요일 (’yoil’) which translates to ‘day’ in English.** Now all that remains to be analyzed is a single Korean character at the beginning of each of the seven words. Here’s what each day in Korean means in English:

* **월 (wol)** in 월요일 (wollyoil – Monday) means **‘moon’**
* **화 (hwa)** in 화요일 (hwayoil – Tuesday) means **‘fire’**
* **수 (su)** in 수요일 (suyoil – Wednesday) means **‘water’**
* **목 (mok)** in 목요일 (mogyoil – Thursday) means **‘wood’ or ‘tree’**
* **금 (geum)** in 금요일 (geumyoil – Friday) means **‘gold’**
* **토 (to)** in 토요일 (toyoil – Saturday) means **‘soil’ or ‘earth’**
* **일 (il)** in 일요일 (illyoil – Sunday) means **‘day’ or ‘sun’**

 We can all agree that Koreans are right: Friday is indeed ‘gold’ and we all love it!

 As a little bonus, here’s an image that may come in handy later. Save it or screenshot it and use it to practice what you’ve just learned.
