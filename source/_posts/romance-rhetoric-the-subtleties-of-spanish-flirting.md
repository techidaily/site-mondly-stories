## Romance Rhetoric: The Subtleties of Spanish Flirting

 Trying to get the attention of a Spanish-speaking_señorita_ or_muchacho_ ? Then a couple of good ol’**Spanish pick up lines** will come in handy. Lucky for you, the Spanish language isn’t short on pick-up lines or_piropos_ – as Spanish-speaking countries call them. On the contrary! Romance languages aren’t called “romance” for nothing, right? Latin people are known for their way of loving and their fiery passion.

 Now, everyone knows flirting can prove to be quite challenging even in your own native language, let alone Spanish. But we’ve got you covered. If you don’t speak the language yet, the following**pick up lines in Spanish** will at least help you make a good first impression and learn some foreign words as a bonus! That, plus your charm, should work wonders. Good luck!

## Funny Pick Up Lines in Spanish

* _¿Te llamas Google? Porque tienes todo lo que busco._ (“Is your name Google? Because you have everything I’m searching for.”)
* _¿Eres una cámara? Porque cada vez que te veo, sonrío._ (“Are you a camera? Because every time I see you, I smile.”)
* _¿Eres un préstamo bancario? Porque tienes mi interés._ (“Are you a bank loan? Because you have my interest.”)
* _¿Eres un billete de lotería? Porque verte me da ganas de ser afortunado._ (“Are you a lottery ticket? Because seeing you makes me feel lucky.”)
* _¿Eres un ladrón? Porque has robado mi corazón._ (“Are you a thief? Because you’ve stolen my heart.”)

 It’s no secret that many people learn new languages in the name of love. What’s spending a few months [learning Spanish](https://app.adjust.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-9326&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-9326?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-9326?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es) compared to the joy of not having to deal with a language barrier in your relationship? However, if you didn’t learn Spanish yet (understandable. that’s a whole new level in a relationship), these funny pick up lines in Spanish can spice up your interactions.

## Best Pick Up Lines for Girls in Spain

* _¡Qué ojazos tienes!_ (“You have such beautiful eyes!”)
* _¡Eres un sol_ (“You are a sun!”)
* _¡Me gustas más que comer con los dedos!_ (“I like you more than eating with my fingers!”
* _¿Te puedo seguir? Porque mi mamá me dijo que siguiera mis sueños._ (“Can I follow you? Because my mom told me to follow my dreams.”)
* _¿De qué juguetería saliste, muñeca?_ (“What toy store did you come from, doll?”)
* _No camines bajo el sol, con este calor los bombones se derriten._ (“Do not walk in the sun, chocolate melts in this heat.”)
* _Perdí mi número, ¿me das el tuyo?_ (“I lost my number, can I have yours?”)
* _¡Ahora resulta que las flores caminan!_ (“Turns out that flowers walk!”
* _Si fueras una estrella, serías la única en mi cielo._ (“If you were a star, you’d be the only one in my sky.”)
* _Si te viera Cristóbal Colón, diría: ¡Santa María, pero qué Pinta tiene esa Niña!_ (“If Christopher Columbus saw you, he would say: Holy Mary, that girl looks incredible!”)

 This last pick up line is a bit more special as there’s a context you have to understand. First, let’s keep in mind that Christopher Columbus completed four Spanish-based voyages across the Atlantic Ocean. Then, the fact that the names of his ships were_La Niña, La Pinta,_ and_La Santa María_ .

 Now that you have the historical context, let’s further explain the meaning of this very Spanish pick up line. In Spanish,_Santa María_ (“Saint Mary”) is often used as an exclamation, similar to the English phrase “Oh my God!”. Additionally,_tener pinta_ is a casual expression used to indicate that someone (or something) appears attractive or looks good. Get it now?

## Use the right Spanish pick up lines

 Girls or guys in Spain or Latino people in general are diverse and unique. However, cultural factors can shape certain aspects of their lives, including their values, traditions, and customs. In Spain and many Latino cultures, family plays a significant role, and there may be a strong emphasis on social connections and community. So, make sure you’re aware of that and maybe even use it to your advantage when flirting.

 If you’re flirting with someone for the first time, take your time to choose a suitable Spanish pick up line. Most of them are meant for many different contexts, but you never know when you can hit a sensitive spot by mistake.

 Although it can be cheesy or corny, everyone loves a good pick up line. If delivered properly, a good Spanish pick up line can even land you the love of your life. Are you in?
