## Bridging the Technologies Behind Chatbots and Speech Recognition with VR

 Mondly’s conversational voice chatbot for language learning was first released by the company inAugust 2016 . The technology uses advanced speech recognition that understands millions of phrases and words in 28 different languages. Since its release, it has been used by millions of Mondly users and has learned millions of new phrases and responses, thanks to the chatbot’s self-learning technology.

 To bridge the technologies behind its chatbot, speech recognition, and VR, the company had to develop a new automatic voice detection system. Alexandru Iliescu , the CEO and co-founder of ATi Studios, spoke about the challenges involved with creating Mondly VR:

> _“The toughest challenge was to make the speech interaction feel natural in VR._
>
> _Because VR is so immersive, we quickly realized that traditional speech interaction models that require a tap or a voice command to enable speech recognition would kill the flow of the experience._
>
> _So we developed our own automatic voice detection system. It calibrates to the room’s background noise, and it ignores unintentional sounds. The result is amazing, the conversations with the virtual characters happen as naturally as real-life conversations – they just flow.”_

## Virtual Reality Language Training in 28 Different Languages

![Mondly VR - learn 30 languages in Virtual Reality](https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Mondly-VR-learn-30-languages-in-Virtual-Reality.png "Mondly Launches Virtual Reality For Learning Languages, Powered By Chatbots 3")

[Learn Languages VR by Mondly](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1272636489423125/?locale=en%5FUS) allows users to practice conversing in a new language with virtual characters; all within realistic situations that teach language fundamentals and help build their confidence.

The first version offers three scenes and 28 languages to explore:

* **The Restaurant** – Practice ordering food and drinks in a small bistro.
* **The Eurotrain** – Have a conversation and make new friends on a train in Europe.
* **The Hotel** – Check into a boutique hotel and score a room with a view.

 Having learned from the usage patterns of over 15 million Mondly users to date, ATi Studios has created the VR application based on what users actually need to effectively [learn a new language](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) – instant feedback and an immersive, real-world experience to build their confidence.

 “ _Fluency in a language is not how many words you know, but how well you communicate with the words you do,_ ” said Iliescu. “ _Our goal with Mondly is to push the envelope of language learning with new technologies that drive our users to become better communicators and have richer life experiences_ . _And the Oculus team and the virtual reality technology they’ve created offered us the perfect environment for achieving this goal._ ”

**Full list of languages:** British English, American English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Romanian, Greek, Portuguese, Arabic, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, and Thai.
