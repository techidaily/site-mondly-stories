## 100+ French Travel Phrases You'll Need In Your Next Trip To France

 “Paris is always a good idea”. Although wrongfully attributed to Audrey Hepburn, this quote is absolutely iconic. If you’ll watch the original [1954 Sabrina movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047437/) , you’ll see that Audrey doesn’t actually say this in it, but there is a Sabrina that does! Watch the [remake from 1995](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114319/) with Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond and you’ll have a surprise. Back to the city of lovers – yes, Paris and France are always a good idea. But you’ll need a few**French travel phrases** to experience your trip to France to the fullest. Why say “I would like a croissant” when you can say “Je voudrais un croissant”? A few [**common French phrases**](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) can make your vacation a lot more interesting… and even_romantique_ !

 There’s no denying that French has a certain elegance when it’s spoken by natives. It’s like a neverending ode to the gods of languages._Merde!_ It’s just… annoyingly beautiful! Even when you use bad words. And contagious. Challenge yourself and test this claim. Binge-watch some [French movies](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) this weekend (that’s easy!). But do it without trying (and failing) to [speak French](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) afterward. Kinda impossible. You’ll see.

Disappointing, I know. But don’t despair! This article has**the best French travel vocabulary** that will save you from the most embarrassing situations you can imagine.
