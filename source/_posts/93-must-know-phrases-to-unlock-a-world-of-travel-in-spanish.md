 Holidays are always “just around the corner”. You dream about them. You measure your working time in months/weeks/days remaining until the vacation.

## 1\. Greetings and other basic phrases – the magic Spanish words

 If you want to spark some Spanish conversations, it takes just a common Spanish word to do it: a greeting. And you probably know one already. The Latins are warm, friendly and very welcoming people, so don’t be surprised if they seem open to conversation. It’s an opportunity you want to take advantage of.

* _¡Buenos días!_ – Good morning!
* _¡Buenas tardes!_ – Good afternoon!
* _¡Buenas noches!_ – Good evening!
* _¡Hola!_ – Hi!

Whether we are talking about passport verification, asking for directions or for help with your luggage, these travel phrases will definitely help you. It’s important to realize that not everybody speaks English.

## 3\. Basic Spanish for travelers that need help

 In this situation, you can also use the basic Spanish travel phrases for conversation that were mentioned in the first bullet points. Don’t hesitate to ask for help if you need it. Taxi drivers, for example, are usually nice people and will surely answer your questions. They might even give you travel tips that only locals know.  
 The questions that will help you the most when you are asking for help are_¿Dónde está…?_ meaning_Where is…?_ and_¿Dónde hay…?_ that is basically the same thing but it is generally used together with indefinite articles like_un_ or_una_ .

* _el aeropuerto_ – the airport
* _la estación de trene_ – the train station
* _la oficina de información turística_ – the tourist information center
* _el puesto de venta de billetes_ – the ticket sales stand
* _una parada de taxis_ – taxi stop
