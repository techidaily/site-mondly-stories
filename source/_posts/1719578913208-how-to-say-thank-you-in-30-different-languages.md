## How To Say Thank You In 30 Different Languages

 Have you ever thought about how important it is to be polite? This is not a matter of culture, but rather a matter of international common sense. It doesn’t matter if you are a French man in Romania or an American woman in Sweden. Common sense translates the same in all languages. How to say “thank you” in different languages should probably be included in students’ curricula at school. Expressing your gratitude is as important as expressing your love.

 Besides, this has everything to do with first impressions. As Will Rogers (American stage and motion picture actor) once said: “You never get a second chance to make a first impression”. So you have to make it count from the first try. We are people. We tend to automatically judge. We only need 30 seconds to make a full semiotic analysis of someone we’ve just met. That’s it! 30 seconds for an impression that may last a lifetime. If you travel to a foreign country, making that good first impression may mean to say**“thank you” in Spanish** (“gracias”). That doesn’t sound that hard to do, isn’t it?

 “Thanks” by Hanny Naibaho©

## The origin of saying “thank you”

 The mere act of expressing gratitude sits at the core of human interaction, so it should be interesting to analyze it a bit more. As the [Oxford Dictionaries](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/thank%5Fyou) explain, “thank you” is “a polite expression used when acknowledging a gift, service, or compliment, or accepting or refusing an offer”. “Thank you” is basically the general expression of gratitude or politeness to someone for an act of kindness that he or she has done.

 But what is the origin of this expression? [Online sources](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/thank--you)  claim that in Old English “thank you” had the form _þancian_ “to give thanks” – a word that originated from Proto-Germanic_thankojan_ (similar to Old Saxon_thancon_ , Old Norse_þakka_ , Danish_takke_ , Old Frisian_thankia_ , German_danken_ – “to thank”). But all this was also derived from the original_thankoz_ which meant “thought, gratitude,” from the Proto-Indo-European root_tong_ – “to think, feel”. In short, that means that “thank you” is actually derived from the verb “to think”! So people used to express their gratitude differently in the past. If we were to paraphrase its meaning, we could say “because of what you have done for me, I think favorably of you”.

 Naturally, there are many other languages in which this expression has transitioned through other forms before settling to its present one. Here are only a few examples:

**–** **Thank you in Portuguese** _(obrigado/obrigada)_ – originates from the past participle of the Latin_obligō_ (“I bind in obligation”)

**–** **Thank you in French** –_merci_ – originates from the Latin_mercēs_ that means “wages, payment, reward”

**–** **Thank you in Spanish** _(gracias)_ and**thank you in Italian** _(grazie)_ are quite similar so it’s no surprise they originate from the same Latin expression –_gratias agere_ – which simply means “to express gratitude”

**–** **Thank you in Japanese** (_arigatō gozaimasu_ or simply_arigatō_ for “thanks) – originates from_arikatashi_ where “ari” is a verb meaning “to be” and “katashi” is an adjective meaning “difficult”. The original meaning of “arigatashi” was “difficult to be”. Put into a context, that would mean that someone’s generosity or behavior is “rare” and thus “special”.
