## Charge Up Chic Italics: Top 20 Slangs Unveiled

 When in Rome, do as Romans do, and use Italian slang words and expressions. No, really. If you’re learning the language and want the full Italian experience, Italian slang is a great way to get it. Slang and even expressions are like the “secret code” of a language, so they can make you feel right at home when you use them. Moreover, if you aim to learn Italian – and truly master it – you should embrace it all: slang words, expressions, idioms, and proverbs. So, let’s dive in!

## Most Common Italian Expressions

1. _Non mi va._ — I don’t feel like it.
2. _Sei fuori._ — Your are out of your mind. (literally “You are out”)
3. _In bocca al lupo!_  — Good luck! (literally “In the mouth of the wolf”)
4. _Non vedo l’ora!_ — I can’t wait! (literally “I can’t see the hour”)
5. _Mi tocca (fare qualcosa)._ — I have to/I’m forced to (do something).
6. _Che pizza!_ — How boring!
7. _Non è male!_ — Not bad!
8. _Neanche per sogno!_ — Don’t even dream about it!
9. _Falla finita!_ — Stop it!
10. _Che ne so!_  — How should I know?

 These are some of the most common Italian expressions you’ll encounter while in Italy. They are unique, humorous, and expressive – just like Italians themselves! I mean, who would have expected Italians to have an expression about pizza that means ‘boring’ when pizza is everybody’s favorite thing ever?

 Before we move on, you need to understand that expressions, sayings, phrases, and idioms is that they are the salt and pepper of any language, not just Italian. And the best ones are, of course, those unique to the language you are learning. Why? Because they are the shortcut to making you sound more fluent.

## Old Italian Expressions

* **_Avere le braccine corte._** To literally “have short arms”. This witty old Italian saying depicts stingy people, humorously suggesting their arms are too short to reach into their pockets!
* **_Non tutte le ciambelle riescono col buco._** “Not all donuts come with a hole”, which symbolizes that not everything in life goes according to plan, and that’s perfectly fine. Indeed, exploring these old Italian expressions is like uncovering hidden treasures, isn’t it?
* **_Mettere una pulce nell’orecchio._** “To put a flea in the ear”, which means “to plant an idea in someone’s head”. We’re basically talking about the Italian Inception, right? 😂
* **_Tra il dire e il fare c’è di mezzo il mare._** “Between saying and doing, there is the sea.” Old Italian expressions are full of wisdom and this one’s no exception as it refers to the big difference between words and actions.
* **_Una volta ogni morte di papa._** This literally translates to “once every Pope’s death” and it means hardly ever as a pope dying doesn’t happen very often. The English counterpart would be “once every blue moon”.
* **_Braccia rubate all’agricoltura._** At first, this Italian expression appears innocuous as it literally means “Arms stolen from agricultural work”. Yet, it sarcastically refers to someone in an “intellectual” job who is clueless, humorously suggesting they might be more suited to farm work.
* **_Prendere due piccioni con una fava._** Interestingly enough, the literal translation of this Italian expression is “to catch two pigeons with one fava bean”, as opposed to our slightly more violent equivalent, “to kill two birds with one stone”.
* **_Chi fa da sé fa per tre._** “Whoever does it himself does it for three.” In other words, if you want it done well, it’s best to do it yourself.
* **_Tocca ferro_ .** While we “knock on wood” to ward off bad luck, Italians prefer to “touch iron”.

 What’s your favorite Italian expression so far? Here’s a quick tip: sprinkle these expressions throughout your conversations without exaggerating. While using them can give the impression that you were born in Italy, overdoing it might come across as a bit unnatural. And it goes the same for Italian slang words!

### 1\. Cavoli amari

_Cavoli amari_ literally translates to “bitter cabbages” in Italian but refers to a tough situation or impending problems. Interestingly, Italians frequently mention cabbages! For instance,_cavoli miei_ (“my cabbages”) implies something is your personal business that others shouldn’t meddle with.

### 2\. Boh

 When you’re clueless about something or you don’t know what to say, in Italian, you can simply say “boh!”. This one is quite similar to the Italian expression_che ne so!_ meaning “how should I know?”.

### 3\. Dai

 There’s no denying that Italians are experts in expression. For example, the Italian expression [“dai!”](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20171207-dai-the-italian-word-with-many-meanings) can be used in three quite different contexts. And if you are wondering how that is possible, well, it’s all about the correct use of intonation, mimics, and [Italian hand gestures](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) .

* _Dai! Veramente?_ – Come on! Really? (expresses surprise or disbelief)
* _Dai! Passa la palla a Luigi!_ – Come on! Pass the ball to Luigi! (encouragement)
* _Dai! Basta! Smettila!_ – Come on! That’s enough! Stop that! (frustration or annoyance)

### 5\. Tirare il pacco

 “To throw the package”. Contrary to what some may think, this has nothing to do with the delivery man. Instead, it means to stand someone up. So, Italians don’t just skip a meeting or a date, they “throw the package”.

### 6\. Schialla

_Scialla_ is an Italian slang word that has become very popular lately, thanks to Gen Z. It basically means “to relax”, “to chill out” or to “keep calm”. It is generally used as an encouragement to “don’t worry”.

 There’s a 2011 movie with the same name in case you’re looking to expand your Italian slang word repertoire further.

### 7\. Figo

 Mostly used by younger people, this Italian slang word is the equivalent of “cool”. If you want to say that something is extraordinary, fantastic, or cool, in Italian you would say_figo_ or_che figata_ .

 Additionally,_figo_ (or_figa_ for women) can also be used to say that someone is very attractive. For example,_Brad Pitt è un gran figo_ translates to “Brad Pitt is very attractive”.

### 8\. Sbronza

_Sbronza_ is for everything related to alcohol as it essentially describes the state of intoxication resulted from consuming it. Are you having a_sbronza_ ? It means you have a hangover.

 If you have to convey the meaning of being drunk in a more formal setting, you would definitely not use_sbronza_ . Instead, you would use terms like_ubriachezza_ (“drunkness”) or_intossicazione alcolica_ (“alcohol intoxication”).

### 9\. Che casino

_Casino_ in Italian has nothing to do with gambling because it is literally a “brothel”. So, this Italian expression actually means “what a mess!” and is used to describe a situation that’s a bit out of control, confusing, or crowded.

### 10\. Beccarsi

_Beccarsi_ is an Italian slang verb that comes from_beccare,_ which literally means “to peck”. However, in slang or informal language,_beccarsi_ has several meanings depending on the context. The most common is “to meet” or “to catch up” with someone. For example,_Ci becchiamo dopo la scuola?_ translates to “Shall we meet up after school?”.

### 11\. Americanata

_Americanata_ is a playful jab, not to be taken offensively, used to describe something absurdly grandiose, extravagant, or exaggerated, reflecting a humorous observation of American culture.
