## Dreaming in Diversity: Mondly Languages' Two-Year Odyssey

 We had a dream. A great dream. We wanted to create something that will positively impact the lives of millions of people around the world. Our passion for technology, design and education inspired us to start working on a language project that was so ambitious, it seemed almost impossible to complete in the beginning.

 Two years ago we made that dream come true. We built a great language learning app and we made it our mission to offer everyone lessons in as many languages as possible.

## On May 28 2014, Mondly

 We started small, but kept thinking big at every step of the way. Our developers, designers, language experts and translators all worked together to build a language learning app that’s easy to use, fun to learn with, and effective in real life situations.

 There were good times and there were difficult times. It was our motivation to build the best language app out there that kept us going. On top of this, the positive feedback that we got from all of you convinced us that we’re doing the right thing.

 We’ve come a long way since the beginning and there’s a lifetime of learning ahead of us.

 With this in mind, we give you an infographic about where Mondly stands today. From here on, sky’s the limit.
