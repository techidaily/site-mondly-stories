 “Mondly is a fast growing and profitable business that expands our reach and scale in the language learning market and drives growth for the company. This acquisition is strategically important to the Group as well as being accretive and driving shareholder returns.”

 “Mondly’s mission has always been to make language learning fun, easy and accessible to everyone.
