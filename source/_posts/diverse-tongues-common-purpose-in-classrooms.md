## Diverse Tongues, Common Purpose in Classrooms

 Every year, on October 5, we are honoring teachers and their role in providing quality education for students everywhere. Also known as International Teachers Day, World Teachers’ Day was established in 1994 and it observes the anniversary of the adoption of the 1966 ILO/UNESCO Recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers. This [Recommendation](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000160495) set the standard regarding the rights and the responsibilities of the teachers concerning their education, employment, recruitment, and teaching conditions.
