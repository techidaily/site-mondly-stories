Hello, Mondly learners!

 We’re happy to announce a much-anticipated addition to the Mondly website: the brand-new [FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) section. Our mission at Mondly has always been to make language learning fun, easy, and accessible for everyone, and we believe this new section will greatly contribute to accomplishing it.

 The new FAQ was designed with you in mind. After talking to many of you, we compiled a list of commonly asked questions about our platform, language learning techniques, features, privacy, and much more. This is how the new section came to be.
