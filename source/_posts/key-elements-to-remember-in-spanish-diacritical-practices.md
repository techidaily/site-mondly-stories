## Key Elements to Remember in Spanish Diacritical Practices

 Navigating Spanish accents‚Äîor accents in any language that utilizes them‚Äîcan be particularly challenging for individuals whose first language doesn‚Äôt include accent marks. How does one type Spanish accent marks on a standard keyboard? How does the pronunciation of a word shift with the addition of an accent mark? Do these marks affect the stress of a word? And how can one remember when they‚Äôre necessary?

 If you‚Äôre not yet familiar with the primary rules of Spanish accents, these questions might seem daunting. However, it‚Äôs crucial not to get discouraged! Accents play a vital role in languages that incorporate them‚Äînot only in Spanish. It‚Äôs essential to understand that the presence or absence of an accent mark can drastically alter the meaning of a word. Mastering the use of accents is indispensable for anyone aiming to become proficient in Spanish. Here are the key facts you need to know about Spanish accents.



## Spanish Accent Marks

 Spanish accent marks or Spanish accents can also be referred to as diacritics, diacritical marks or diacritical signs. These represent an extra symbol or glyph added to a letter.

The Spanish language has three types of accent marks:

* **Tilde**
* **Acute accents**
* **Diaeresis**

### Tilde

 The tilde is only applied to the letter ‚Äún‚Äù, creating the character ‚Äú√±‚Äù, which is considered a separate letter in the Spanish alphabet and appears as such in dictionaries. Also known as_la tilde de la e√±e_ or_la virgulilla_ , ‚Äú√±‚Äù appears in words such as_ni√±o_ (‚Äúchild‚Äù),_ma√±ana_ (‚Äútomorrow‚Äù),_se√±or_ (‚Äúmister, sir‚Äù),_a√±o_ (‚Äúyear‚Äù) and even_espa√±ol_ (‚ÄúSpanish‚Äù ‚Äì the language).

### Diaeresis

 The diaeresis is only found on the letter ‚Äúu‚Äù, marked by two dots above it_(√º)_ . It indicates that the ‚Äúu‚Äù should be pronounced independently, as a separate vowel, not as part of a digraph or diphthong. Although rare, the diaeresis in Spanish is typically placed immediately after ‚Äúg‚Äù or immediately before ‚Äúe‚Äù or ‚Äúi‚Äù in a word. In case you were wondering, yes, it is distinct from an umlaut, which denotes a sound shift.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Acute Accent

 The acute accent, represented by a short diagonal line above vowels, is the most common accent mark in Spanish. Acute accents occur only once per word and their purpose is to stress words, distinguish between otherwise identical words and indicate questions.

## All Spanish Accents Letters

* **√°**
* **√©**
* **√≠**
* **√≥**
* **√∫**
* **√±**
* **√º**

**Spanish uses accent marks on only six different letters** **.** Accent marks are never applied to any other letters in the alphabet, so it‚Äôs easy to remember them. Here‚Äôs how Spanish accent letters are grouped by type of accent marks:

* **_√°, √©, √≠, √≥, √∫_ use acute accents;**
* **_√±_ uses the tilde;**
* **_√º_ uses the diaeresis.**

## Spanish Pronunciation Without Accent Marks

 In Spanish, having [accent](https://www.britannica.com/topic/accent-linguistics) marks makes speaking easier because they indicate the correct pronunciation of a word by telling you which syllable to stress or emphasize. But how do you pronounce Spanish words without accent marks? Here are the two main rules for how to pronounce [Spanish words](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) without accent marks:

 1\. If the word ends with a vowel, the letter ‚Äún‚Äù or the letter ‚Äús‚Äù, the stress is on the**next to last syllable.** For example:

* _com-pu-ta-**DO** \-ra_ (‚Äúcomputer‚Äù in English)
* _her-**MO** \-so_ (‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù in English)

 2\. If the word ends with a consonant (other than ‚Äún‚Äù or ‚Äús‚Äù), the stress is on the**last syllable.** For example:

* _fe-**LIZ**_  (‚Äúhappy‚Äù in English)
* _pro-fe-**SOR**_  (‚Äúprofessor‚Äù in English)

## Spanish Pronunciation With Accents Marks

 If your Spanish word has an acute accent, ignore the previously mentioned rules and**stress the syllable that contains the accent.** You‚Äôll quickly become accustomed to pronouncing and writing these words. A helpful option for practice is to use the Mondly Chatbot, where you can both SEE and HEAR the words.

 In Spanish, stress and accents are closely related as they help distinguish between words in both pronunciation and meaning. For example,_‚Äòella mand√≥ una carta‚Äô_ means ‚Äòshe sent a letter‚Äô, while_‚Äòyo mando una carta‚Äô_ means ‚ÄòI send a letter‚Äô. Here are some additional examples where accent marks can completely change the meaning of a word in Spanish:

| Spanish words with accent marks | Spanish words without accent marks | Example sentence using both words                              | Translation                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _t√∫_ (you)                      | _tu_ (your)                        | _T√∫ tienes un perro muy bonito. ¬øEs tu √∫nica mascota?_         | You have a very cute dog. Is it your only pet?                   |
| _t√©_ (tea)                      | _te_ (you)                         | _Te recomiendo que tomes mucho t√©._                            | I recommend that you drink a lot of tea.                         |
| _c√≥mo_ (how/what)               | _como_ (like, as)                  | _¬øC√≥mo se llama tu colega? ¬øEs tan inteligente como Cristian?_ | What is your colleague's name? Is he as smart as Cristian?       |
| _√©l_ (he)                       | _el_ (the)                         | _A √©l le gusta el vino._                                       | He likes the wine.                                               |
| _s√≠_ (yes)                      | _si_ (if)                          | _S√≠, quiero probar el chorizo pero solo si no es picante._     | Yes, I want to try the pork sausage but only if it is not spicy. |

 As you can see, Spanish differentiates between homonyms by using accent marks. Once you understand how Spanish accent marks make everything easier, you‚Äôll love learning about them!

## Spanish Accents Rules

 Acute accents are necessary in Spanish to indicate the stressed syllable, especially in the following cases:

1. When a word ends in a vowel, -n, or -s and the stress is on the last syllable. Example: _cami√≥n_ (truck)
2. When a word ends in a consonant (excluding -n or -s) or a vowel and the stress is on the second to last syllable. Example: _f√°cil_ (easy)
3. When the stress falls on the antepenultimate syllable (the syllable before the second to last). Example: _pol√≠tico_ (politician)
4. When the stress is on the syllable before the antepenultimate, especially with Spanish pronouns in gerunds, imperatives, or Spanish infinitives. Example: _c√≥mpramelo_ (buy it for me)

### Exception

 Words ending in -mente have two stressed syllables, complicating Spanish accent placement. What you can do is remove the ending (-mente), follow the above rules, then add the ending back on and stress both the accented Spanish letter and MEN-te.

### Question Words

 All Spanish question words require an acute accent, even if they don‚Äôt have one in declarative sentences. That‚Äôs basically how you differentiate between interrogative words: when they are used in a question, they have an accent; when used to answer a question or make a statement, they don‚Äôt.

 For example, when you ask_‚Äò_ _¬øcu√°nto tengo que pagar?‚Äô_ (how much do I have to pay?) you use an acute accent, but when you say_‚Äòt√∫ no sabes cuanto te voy a extra√±ar‚Äô_ (you don‚Äôt know how much I will miss you), you don‚Äôt.
