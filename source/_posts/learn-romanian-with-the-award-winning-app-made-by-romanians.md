## Learn Romanian With the Award-Winning App Made by Romanians

 What better way is there to learn Romanian than with an app made by Romanians themselves? Forget about dry memorization techniques that lack context. **The world’s best way to [learn Romanian is Mondly](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-6033&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-6033?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=ro&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-6033?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=ro) , an [app made in Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondly) .** Featuring fun, easy and effective language courses designed by the natives for you, Mondly will help you speak Romanian from day 1.

 You don’t even have to take my word for it. Have you heard about Dracula? Famous vampire, born and raised in Transylvania, Romania. How do you think he knows such perfect English? He learned it with Mondly, of course!

 Kidding about the Dracula part, but Mondly can really help you learn up to 41 languages. Here’s more about how it can help you master Romanian.

## The Romanian language — Dracula’s mother tongue

 With over 23 million [speakers worldwide](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ron) , the Romanian language is the official and national language of Romania and Moldova and one of the official languages of the European Union. If you don’t know where to locate [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania) , think Central Eastern Europe. As already mentioned, Romania is also the home of the infamous Dracula, most commonly known by Romanians as [Vlad the Impaler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad%5Fthe%5FImpaler) .

 One of the most surprising things about **Romanian is the fact that it is a [Romance language](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) ,** therefore related to Italian, Spanish, French and Portuguese. Entirely surrounded by Slavic-speaking countries, it’s still a mystery how Romanian and most of its Latin roots managed to prevail as a Romance [language in Eastern Europe](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) . Slavic populations that passed through the territory at some point did not transform, but rather just influenced the Romanian language. That’s why there are some Romanian words that sound nothing like their Italian, Spanish or French counterparts.

![romance language](https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/romance-language.png "Learn Romanian With The Award-Winning App Made By Romanians 2")

 Romanian, the unusual Romance language.

 Written using the Latin alphabet (plus five additional letters with diacritics), **Romanian is fairly easy to read and speak because it is a phonetic language.** This means that all the words are pronounced exactly as they are spelled. Awesome news if you want to learn Romanian fast! Besides, if you’re already familiar with one or more Romance languages, learning gets even easier. Here are some words and phrases that may look familiar:

| English | Spanish | Italian | French | Roma- nian |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------ | ---------- |
| good    | bueno   | buono   | buono  | bun        |
| night   | noche   | notte   | nuit   | noapte     |
| mother  | madre   | madre   | mère   | mamă       |
| sky     | cielo   | cielo   | ciel   | cer        |
| milk    | leche   | latte   | lait   | lapte      |
| eye     | ojo     | occhio  | oeil   | ochi       |
| rain    | lluvia  | pioggia | pluie  | ploaie     |
| house   | casa    | casa    | maison | casă       |
| five    | cinco   | cinque  | cinq   | cinci      |

 As you can see from these examples,**Romanian is closest to Italian** most of the time. So it’s no mere coincidence that the largest population of Romanian expats can be found in Italy.

 When it comes to [grammar](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Romanian-language) though, Romanian seems to be the odd one out. Due to its isolation from the other Latin languages, it developed in rather different directions. That is why its definite articles are enclitic (attached to the end of the noun) and not proclitic (in front of the noun). However, unlike other Latin languages, Romanian has stayed true to the Latin morphological case differentiation: nominative/accusative, genitive/dative, and vocative.

## Speak Romanian like a local on your next trip to Romania

 What piqued your interest in Romania? Was it its appearance in the [Top Gear show](https://www.topgear.com/car-news/big-reads/transfagarasan-highway-worlds-best-road) with the world’s best road? Was it falling in love with a Romanian? The famous song ‘Dragostea din Tei’? Sebastian Stan? Dracula? Or maybe just a friend that told you about all the great parties in Bucharest?

 No matter the reason, know this: you have yet to discover Romania’s full potential. If you are looking for a country where you can climb spectacular mountains, go to the seaside, eat good food and meet fascinating people, Romania should be on your list. Watch [Flavours of Romania](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13094256/) on Netflix if you want to get a better idea of what this little country is all about.

 Now, if you do decide to visit, what better way is there to fully discover a new destination than by interacting with its people? And Mondly empowers you to do just that. By focusing on real conversations and pronunciation exercises, the app will allow you to speak like a Romanian native before your next trip there.

![speak romanian](https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/speak-romanian-960x720.jpg "Learn Romanian With The Award-Winning App Made By Romanians 4")

 “Transfăgărășan, the best road in the world” by Gints Gailis©

 The practical conversations inspired by real-life were recorded by Romanian native voice artists so you can hear how the real language sounds like. This means that the learning process is swifter than in any other app. You get to study the lesson, expand your vocabulary and then employ what you’ve learned with a dedicated conversation exercise.

 Like talking to an old friend,[speaking Romanian](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-6033&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-6033?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=ro&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-6033?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=ro) has never been easier!

## 10 basic Romanian words and phrases you can learn right now

 Before you go, here’s a small gift for you: you’re going to**learn how to say ‘hello’ in Romanian.** ‘Salut!’, ‘bună!’ (’ă’ sounds like the second ‘a’ in ‘magical’) are the best choices for an informal hello, but you can also use ‘hei!’ which is pronounced the same way as the English ‘hey!’. If you need something a little more formal, you can use ‘bună dimineața’ in the morning (’t’ is pronounced ‘ts’), ‘bună ziua’ during noon and ‘bună seara’ in the evening.

 That being said, here are the ten most important Romanian words and phrases. Master these and you are going to make a lot of friends in Romania.

* Hello! – Bună!
* yes – da
* no – nu
* Thanks. – Mulțumesc.
* I’m sorry. – Îmi pare rău./Scuze.
* What’s your name? – Cum te cheamă?
* I am… – Eu sunt…
* How are you? – Ce mai faci?
* Great! – Super!
* Goodbye! – La revedere! (formal)/ Pa! (informal)
