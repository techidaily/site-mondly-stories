## Shaping Future Learning Landscapes With AI Tools

 The positive impact of AI in education is only starting to show. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been blowing off our minds for a while now, and this is only the beginning. As it continues to get smarter every day, we will soon have a more personalized learning experience than we have ever imagined. Before the pandemic, we may have been reluctant to adopt AI in education, but not anymore. Today, more and more people are starting to see the benefits of using AI to help humanity learn faster.

 But what exactly is AI? Well, who better to ask that if not AI itself? Here’s what [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) said: “AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines that can think and act like humans. AI systems are designed to learn from their environment, recognize patterns, and adapt to changing situations. AI is used in a variety of industries, including healthcare, finance, and robotics.”

## The future of AI in education

 Let’s set the record straight right from the start:**AI didn’t write these words. A human did.** A human who has no reason to exaggerate the importance of AI. While some of us may be biased, fearing that AI will one day replace us, we have to stop for a second and reflect. Rather than replace real people, AI will enhance the efficacy and speed of our efforts, at least for now.

 When it comes to education, the advantages are astounding. Just the other day, I used an AI-powered app to talk to Mozart. Just imagine that! I asked about his relationship with Antonio Salieri, his favorite piece he had ever composed and more. I was so self-aware that I even asked if he was bothered by my many questions.

 However, talking to influential people in history to broaden your knowledge of different domains is just the tip of the iceberg. Here are just a few of**the benefits of AI in education.**

### Instant feedback for students

 Having 25 students in your class makes it virtually impossible to give real-time feedback to everyone. Then it’s also the matter of the tests. Teachers spend hours correcting and grading for just one class. Meanwhile, as a student, waiting for an important test result can be stressful. And when it finally arrives, you no longer remember your answer, so it’s hard to know what area you should improve.

 Nevertheless, using AI could change all. Even as it is today, AI has the power to give instant feedback to all students at once. Teachers would no longer spend countless hours grading and students would get feedback in real time.

### Personalized lessons

 Personalized learning works best for knowledge gaps. There are always two, three or more students who understand the entire lesson from day 1, but what about those who don’t? AI could tailor the lesson content according to a student’s specific needs and help everyone get on the same page.

 One of the best things about personalized learning is that it targets specific needs and learning methods. Everyone will get to learn in their own time and style.

### Better engagement

 Using AI in the classroom could also help teachers speak the language of their students. One thing that all youngsters have in common is an affinity for technology.

 Once teachers use technology to enhance their lessons (digital textbooks, study guides, information visualization and more), students will engage more.

### 24/7 tutoring

 AI can also be a great tool for supporting 24/7 tutoring. AI-driven chatbots and virtual tutors ([Mondly VR](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4214902388537196/ "https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4214902388537196/") is a great example!) can be used to provide students with round-the-clock access to educational resources and support. These AI-based tutors can even provide personalized help by offering real-time feedback and guidance to students as they learn.

 Additionally, AI can monitor student progress and offer comprehensive analytics to educators and tutors, allowing them to adapt their teaching methods to best meet the needs of the student.

### Education without borders

 Probably the best thing about bringing the power of AI in education would be to facilitate the learning of any course across the globe anytime, anywhere. Do you want to study at Princeton? Are intellectually equipped to do it? Great! AI can help you do it from anywhere.

 The first thing that comes to mind in this situation is exams. How can you ensure that students aren’t cheating? The answer is AI-powered remote proctoring. Look into it. It’s more clever than you’d think.

## Say “hola!” to personalized language learning

 Now that we discussed education in general let’s move on to language learning. Having all the knowledge in the entire universe is virtually useless if you can share your thoughts with other people. Speaking more than one language can help you connect and share ideas with individuals from every corner of the world.

 However, before speaking a new language, you must learn it and that’s the tricky part. People will always say you have to practice. But why increase your anxiety levels and talk to a native speaker if you’re not ready yet? Using a language learning chatbot such as [Mondly](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-7409&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-7409&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-7409) ’s, you can eliminate the effects of foreign language anxiety and refine your speaking skills without fear of embarrassment. All from the comfort of your home.

 If you want to understand how AI can and will revolutionize language learning, take all the benefits mentioned above and multiply “personalized learning” by 100\. There’s nothing more important than personalized training in language learning.

 Some of us would [learn Japanese](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) to read manga, some would need [English for business](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) , and others would like to [speak Spanish](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) with their loved ones. The bottom line is**our needs differ.** And when it comes to languages, AI can make all the difference.

 Language learning chatbots are not perfect now, but in a few years (or maybe even months!), artificial intelligence will [change language learning forever](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) . Are you ready?
