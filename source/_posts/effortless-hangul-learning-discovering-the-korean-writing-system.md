 The Korean alphabet, referred to as Hangul within South Korea, is the official writing system of the Korean language. Created in the 15th century by King Sejong the Great to increase literacy, Hangul is renowned for its simplicity and logical design. Although the Korean language is one of the [hardest languages to learn](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) for English speakers, Hangul enables ease of learning and pronunciation for everyone starting to learn Korean.

 Whether you’re a BTS fan (aka the Bangtan Boys, a South Korean boy band) or a Korean culture enthusiast in general, Hangul is the perfect starting point if you want to delve deeper into your passion. So, let’s learn the Korean alphabet!

## History of Hangul – World’s Most Ingenious Alphabet

 Usually, we don’t discuss history when it comes to writing systems, but the history of Hangul is absolutely fascinating, and you’ll surely want to find out more.

 The Korean alphabet, also known as Hangul or Hangeul in South Korea and Chosŏn’gŭl in North Korea, was invented in 1443 by King Sejong the Great, the fourth king in Korea’s Joseon dynasty.

 For hundreds of years, before Hangul was created, Koreans wrote using Classical Chinese characters (which they called Hanja) alongside other native phonetic writing systems. However, many lower-class people didn’t know how to read or write because of the fundamental differences between Korean and Chinese and the large number of Chinese characters. After all, even today, many people find Chinese and [Japanese](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) very difficult to learn because of their complex writing systems.

 Thus, to help more common people become literate, King Sejong the Great personally created and promulgated a new alphabet: the Korean alphabet. The new writing system was designed so people with little or no education could easily learn to read and write.

![hangul sejong](https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hangul-sejong-600x400.jpg "Korean Alphabet – A Quick Guide To Hangul 8")

 “King Sejong the Great, creator of Hangul” by Mathew Schwartz©

 A document published in 1446 and discovered in 1940 explains that the design of the Korean consonants mimics their articulator’s shape and phonetic features when pronouncing them and the vowels are based on the principles of vowel harmony and yin and yang.

### **Opposition and revival**

 But that’s not how the story ends.[The new alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul) faced opposition from the literary elite, who believed Hanja was the only legitimate writing system and saw the circulation of the Korean alphabet as a threat to their status. Nonetheless, the Korean alphabet entered popular culture and was especially used by women and popular fiction writers.

 In 1504, King Yeonsangun banned the study and publication of the Korean alphabet after documents and posters criticizing him were published.

 However, the late 16th and 17th centuries saw a revival of the Korean alphabet when poetry and novels written in the Korean alphabet flourished.

 Then, thanks to Korean nationalism and Western missionaries’ promotion of the Korean alphabet,**Hangul** (a term coined by linguist Ju Si-gyeong in 1912)**was adopted in official documents for the first time in 1894.**

 The use of Hangul met even more opposition and reforms under Japanese rule, but it eventually became the exclusive writing system in both North and South Korea after 1950.

## Guide to the Korean Alphabet

**The Korean alphabet or Hangul consists of 40 letters:**

* **24 basic letters**  
  * 14 consonants (ㄱ ㄴ ㄷ ㄹ ㅁ ㅂ ㅅ ㅇ ㅈ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ)  
  * 10 vowels (ㅏ ㅑ ㅓ ㅕ ㅗ ㅛ ㅜ ㅠ ㅡ ㅣ)
* **16 complex letters** (formed by combining the basic letters)  
  * 11 complex vowels  
  * 5 double consonants

 The name “Hangeul” combines the Korean word **_han_ (한) – meaning “great” – and_geul_ (글) – meaning “script”.** However, the word_han_ is also used to refer to Korea in general, so the name can also translate to “Korean script”.

 Unlike Chinese or [Japanese](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) , which have hundreds or even thousands of characters – each with 10, 15, or even more strokes –**the most complex Korean character has only five strokes.** Besides, Hangul is a very scientific alphabet. Once you manage to understand the logic behind it, Korean writing becomes easier.

 Korean characters are called_jamo_ (자모), and they are written in syllabic blocks arranged in two dimensions. One such block always has exactly one syllable. For example, to write “honeybee” in Korean (_kkulbeol_), you’ll write 꿀벌, not ㄲㅜㄹㅂㅓㄹ. Today, Korean texts are typically written from left to right, with spaces between words and Western-style punctuation.

 As mentioned earlier,**Hangul is a featural writing system.** This means that Korean symbols mimic the shape of the mouth made when the corresponding sound is created. Absolutely fascinating! Let’s go into a little more detail and see how to pronounce the letters of the Korean alphabet.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Korean Consonant Pronunciation

 Languages from different language groups rarely resemble each other. Thus, it’s very difficult to explain the sounds of a language using the letters of another. In our context, this means that there is no perfect way to represent Korean characters using Latin/English letters or sounds. The English letters we will use to explain how to pronounce the letters of the Korean alphabet are the closest representation possible.

 To better understand**how to pronounce Hangul,** it’s best to go to language learning apps such as [Mondly](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5015&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5015?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=ko&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5015?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=ko) , where crystal-clear audios recorded by fluent voice actors will help you understand the pronunciation particularities of the Korean language.

 For example, the sounds of the 14 consonants (or the extended list of 19) of the Korean language change depending on whether they appear at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of a syllable. Here’s a Korean alphabet chart with consonants for beginners to help you get started:

![korean consonants chart](https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/korean-consonants-chart-600x291.jpg "Korean Alphabet – A Quick Guide To Hangul 10")

 Korean consonants chart for beginners

 As you can see, the complex or double consonants are in a different color on the last row of the chart. Additionally, under each consonant, you’ll find its corresponding sound at the beginning and at the end of the syllable. Some of them have identical sounds regardless of their place in the syllable. Furthermore, some of them are silent and some of them are never used syllable-finally (like ㄸ, ㅃ, and ㅉ).

 Take “ㅇ” for example, which is silent when it is at the beginning of the syllable and it is used as a placeholder when the syllable starts with a vowel.

 Let’s see some other Korean consonants whose sounds transform due to location changes in a word.

* **ㅈ** : 죽 \[**c** huk\] – “porridge” and 콩죽 \[k’ong-**j** uk\] – “bean porridge”;
* **ㅂ:** 밥 \[**p** ap\] – “rice” and 보리밥 \[pori**b** ap\] – “barley mixed with rice”
* **ㄱ:** 공 \[**k** ong\] – “ball” and 새 공 \[sae**g** ong\] – “new ball”

 It may seem a bit overwhelming now, but with some study, you’ll eventually master all these rules. The secret is to see all the Korean symbols in action in an actual context. Just make sure you start practicing [Korean with Mondly](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5015&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5015?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=ko&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5015?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=ko) and you won’t be sorry. Speaking your first words in Korean takes just 10 minutes a day.

## Comprehensive Guide to Korean Vowel Pronunciation

 The Korean vowels are generally separated into two categories: monophthongs and diphthongs. While monophthongs are produced with a single articular movement, diphthongs feature an articulatory change and typically consist of two elements: a glide (or a semivowel) and a monophthong.

 The best part about Korean vowels is that they are easier to learn because **they don’t change depending on their position in the syllable.** Here’s a Korean alphabet chart to help you with vowel pronunciation:

 The ones that are represented with a different color on the last two rows are the 11 complex vowels that combine basic letters.

 There you have it! Now you know all the Korean characters. Make sure to practice what you’ve learned, and you can say you officially mastered Korean writing._Good job, you!_

## Korean Letters Design

 The alphabetic order of the Korean alphabet is called_ganada_ (가나다 순) and it does not mix consonants and vowels. Rather, consonants come first and vowels come next.

 Now, when you’re learning Korean for beginners, it is sometimes useful to know the names of the Korean letters. If you don’t know how to pronounce a word, you could spell it using these names. However, they should only be used as a guide in the beginning. Don’t rely on this kind of trick for a long period of time, or you’ll risk never mastering the art of the Hangul.

| ㅟ                       | wi                 |
| ㅠ                       | yu                 |
| ㅡ                       | eu                 |
| ㅢ                       | ui                 |
| ㅣ                       | i                  |

 Because the vowels’ names are actually the sounds they make, this bit will be easier to remember. Good luck!

## Genius of Hangul: Korean Pronunciation

 For an untrained eye, Korean characters might seem meaningless, but there’s a much more complex story behind them. Scripts can transcribe languages at the level of morphemes (logographic scripts like Hanja), syllables (syllabaries like [Japanese kana](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) ), segments (alphabetic scripts like the Latin script we use in English), or, sometimes, distinctive features. Well, imagine that the Korean alphabet incorporates aspects of the latter three.

 Hangul groups sounds into syllables, uses distinct symbols for segments and sometimes uses distinct strokes to indicate distinctive features like the place of articulation (labial, coronal, velar, glottal), the manner of articulation (plosive, nasal, sibilant, aspiration) and so on.

 The consonants fall into five homorganic groups – each with its own basic shape. We must not forget that the Korean symbols for consonants mimic the shape of the mouth when the corresponding sound is created. Let’s explore the basic shape of each group:

* **velar consonants** (ㄱ g \[k\], ㅋ ḳ \[kʰ\]):**ㄱ** is a side view of the back of the tongue raised toward the velum;**ㅋ** is derived from**ㄱ** with an extra stroke for the burst of aspiration.
* **sibilant consonants** (ㅅ s \[s\], ㅈ j \[tɕ\], ㅊ ch \[tɕʰ\]):**ㅅ** represents a side view of the teeth and the horizontal line at the top of**ㅈ** represents the firm contact with the roof of your mouth; the horizontal stroke topping**ㅊ** represents an additional burst of aspiration.
* **coronal consonants** (ㄴ _n_  \[n\] ,ㄷ _d_  \[t\] ,ㅌ ṭ \[tʰ\] ,ㄹ _r_  \[ɾ, l\]): **ㄴ** is a side view of the tip of the tongue raised toward the gum ridge; the horizontal line at the top of**ㄷ** represents steady contact with the roof of the mouth; the middle stroke on**ㅌ** represents a burst of aspiration and the top of ㄹ represents a flap of the tongue.
* **bilabial consonants** (ㅁ _m_  \[m\] ,ㅂ _b_  \[p\] ,ㅍ _p̣_  \[pʰ\]) –**ㅁ** represents the shape of the lips brought together; the top of**ㅂ** represents the release burst of the b, the top horizontal stroke of**ㅍ** is for the burst of aspiration.
* **dorsal consonants** (ㅇ ‘/_ng_  \[ʔ, ŋ\] ,ㅎ _h_  \[h\]) –**ㅇ** is an outline of the throat and **ㅎ** is pronounced in the throat with a close represented by the top horizontal line. The extra vertical stroke represents a burst of aspiration.

## Additional Tips for Learning Hangul

 Another thing you need to master in Korean writing is**letter placement within block shapes.** It’s been said that there are around 11,000 block shapes possible in the Korean alphabet. So, how do you place a letter within a block? Do you have to remember them all by heart?

 Don’t worry. No. Once you understand the logic behind letter placement within a block, Korean writing will become a piece of cake for you. Here are some tips:

* if the vowel consists of a long vertical line like**ㅏ, ㅑ, ㅓ, ㅕ,** or**ㅣ** , the consonant accompanying it will take the first (or the left) half of the block and the vowel will be written in the second half:**ㅂ + ㅣ = 비** (bi) or**ㅇ + ㅏ = 아** (a);
* if the vowel consists of a long horizontal line like**ㅗ, ㅛ, ㅜ, ㅠ,** or**ㅡ,** the consonant accompanying it will be written on the upper half of the block and the vowel in the lower half:**ㅋ + ㅠ = 큐** (kyu) or**ㅇ + ㅗ = 오** (o);
* if you have a consonant and a vowel and then another final consonant attached at the end, the second consonant letter will be written at the very bottom of the block shape and will be called**받침** _batchim_ (“supporting floor”):**부 + ㄹ = 불** (bul) or**아 + ㄴ = 안** (an);
* if the vowel combines orientations (has both a long vertical line and a long horizontal line like**ㅢ**), then it will wrap around the initial character from the bottom to the right:**ㅇ+ ㅢ = 의** (ui).

Before you go, make sure you check out these frequently asked questions.

### How long does it take to learn Hangul?

 Hangul can be learned in as little as a couple of hours. According to a popular Korean saying about Hangul and its characters, “a wise man can acquaint himself with them \[the characters\] before the morning is over; a stupid man can learn them in the space of ten days”.

### What are the benefits of learning Hangul?

 Learning Hangul offers numerous benefits, including a key to understanding the Korean language, improved communication with Korean speakers, a deeper understanding of Korean culture, access to a wealth of resources in Korean, enhanced career prospects, personal development through cognitive challenges, demonstration of cultural sensitivity, and enriched travel experiences in South Korea.

### What are some common mistakes that learners make when learning Hangul?

 Some common mistakes that learners make when learning Hangul include incorrect Korean pronunciation due to not fully understanding the phonetic system, confusion between similar-looking Korean characters, overlooking the importance of stroke order in writing characters, and neglecting to practice writing characters regularly. Additionally, learners may struggle with memorizing character combinations and syllable structures, which can lead to difficulties in reading and writing Korean words correctly.
