## Mondly Supports Education by Investing in State-Of-The-Art Apple Technology for Students

 We are proud to announce that we’ve just inaugurated a second Mondly iMac lab at Transilvania University of Brașov. In the last 11 months, we have sponsored the university with a total of**30 brand new iMacs** . These are **the first Apple computers the university trains its students on.** But there’s a whole story to it.

 The journey started in 2012 when our founders – Alexandru Iliescu and Tudor Iliescu – decided to quit their corporate jobs and build mobile apps. They borrowed 1,000 euros from their parents, bought their first MacBook and began working on their first iPhone app.

 Seven years later, Mondly is an award-winning language learning app with over**40 million downloads** in**190 countries** . That first MacBook was a part of their recipe to success – a recipe they decided to share with the students of Transilvania University of Brașov.

 Both Alexandru and Tudor are alumni of the university, so giving something back to the school that contributed to their training and development was the natural thing to do. Thus, in April 2018, **Mondly sponsored The Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science with 10 brand new iMacs.**

 _iOS app development can only be done on Apple computers, but since the university was equipped with Windows computers only, students didn’t yet have the tools to learn to develop apps for an app store that generated [93% more revenue](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/11/app-store-generated-93-more-revenue-than-google-play-in-q3/) than its closest competitor in the third quarter of 2018\. We wanted to give them the opportunity to build the future in a state-of-the-art iMac lab_ , says Alexandru Iliescu, CEO of Mondly.

 Alexandru Iliescu, CEO of Mondly

 We, at Mondly, believe that the key to positive change is investing in education. This is why we didn’t want to stop at only one iMac lab. The next step was to put together an**iOS app development course** for the undergraduates of**The Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science** . Thus, every Thursday for 3 months, they attended the Mondly iOS course held by one of our top specialists.

 The feedback for the first 10 Apple computers and the iOS app development course was overwhelming. Students would stop by our booth at local events and tell us stories about how fascinated they were with the new computers. That was the moment when we knew we needed to continue. And we did.

 In March 2019 we sponsored **The Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science with another 10 brand new iMacs** and **inaugurated a second state-of-the-art laboratory at The Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science** . In less than one year, we proudly equipped Transilvania University of Brașov with 30 Apple computers – a first-ever**event for Brașov** and its university.

 The inauguration of the second Mondly iMac lab

 Needless to say, the second Mondly iOS app development course has already kicked off at The Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Enthusiasts are gathering every week to learn the basics and share their own accomplishments.

 It was our genuine wish as a team to do good and invest the fruits of our labor in [the future of education](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) . And this is only the beginning.
