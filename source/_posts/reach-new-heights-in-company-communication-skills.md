## Reach New Heights in Company Communication Skills

 Effective communication in the corporate world relies heavily on language, which serves as the essential conduit for the flow of ideas, decision-making and relationship-building.

 As global markets expand and teams become more diverse, language training is no longer a luxurious add-on to professional development and the learning of skills alone; it’s an essential bridge to success.

 But in the quest to equip your team with the language skills and linguistic tools they need, the one-size-fits-all approach falls short of what is required in the mosaic of different languages, other cultures and corporate cultures. This is where customization becomes paramount.

 In this comprehensive guide, we explore examples and practices of the strategic framework that enables companies to communicate and transcend [language barriers](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) .

 By delving deep into identifying, customizing and measuring corporate and other language learning skills training goals that mirror your unique corporate culture, you’re not merely investing resources in successful corporate language training and learning skills; you’re nurturing an ecosystem poised for growth and globalized impact.

## Understanding your corporate culture

 Before delving into a new language or training, the first step is to understand the ethos that drives your organization.

 Corporate culture encompasses the shared values, beliefs and behaviors that define ‘the way things are done around here’.

 This is not a surface-level branding exercise; it’s the DNA of your company, shaping every interaction from the boardroom to the break room.

### Defining corporate culture

 Corporate culture includes elements such as the language goals, the company’s mission, vision and goals. It also includes the environment in which employees work, the reputation, the company’s structure and policies and the beliefs that employees hold about the organization.

 Every aspect of this culture, from how hierarchies and resources are managed to the preferred style of collaborative problem-solving, it all intersects with language use.

### Cultural impact on language training goals

 Consider two companies: one, a traditional, meticulously formal corporate structure with a preference for detailed, hierarchical language use; and the other, a young, vibrant startup with an informal, creative approach to language studies.

 The [language learning](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) goals for both will differ drastically. The former may require employees to master business etiquette and speak in [multiple languages](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) , while language learning goals for the latter may emphasize conversational proficiency in phrases, words and industry buzzwords.

## Identifying training objectives

 Language proficiency is not a monolith. The expectations for language work of a customer-facing salesperson will vary significantly from those of either person or R&D team member. This step is about precision and intentionality.

### Assessing needs per role

 Conducting role-based language assessments is the first step towards granularity in language courses.

 This practice involves examining job functions in detail to determine the importance of specific [skills and language](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) skill sets required.

 Sales professionals may focus on learning techniques for cultivating persuasive language, for example, while tech teams could gravitate towards comprehending complex technical manuals in a foreign language.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




### Setting clear and measurable goals

 It’s not enough to vaguely aim for ‘fluency’. Smart corporations set out [language skills training](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) objectives that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-Bound (SMART).

 This might be the ability to enhance the ability to conduct meetings in a foreign language or improve written correspondence proficiency by a certain percentile within two different languages over a defined period of study time. Being specific is essential to be able to track and create realistic goals.

## Customizing training programs

 The heart of customization lies not only in tailoring language content but, of course, also in weaving it seamlessly with your organization’s fabric.

### Aligning with corporate values

 Every last word or phrase learned and every nuance grasped should resonate with the importance of your company’s mission.

 If your core value is customer service, then ’empathetic communication in support of service recovery’ becomes a desired language skill.

 If innovation is a top priority, for example, then speaking the vernacular vocabulary of patents and inventions is a training staple.

### Incorporating industry-specific lingo

 Language can be as idiosyncratic as culture. Medical, legal, technical and financial industries have their own lexicons of words, phrases, vocabulary, syntax and other tools of jargon.

 Corporate [language training](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) should include context-appropriate language and the ability to learn vocabulary that’s indigenous to your sector.

## Engaging stakeholders

 The journey towards linguistic empowerment is ultimately a collective one. Involving all concerned parties in the practice of speaking and learning a language together early on is a winning strategy.

### HR and trainers as partners

 HR managers are the gatekeepers of talent development, while corporate trainers are the architects of [language learning](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) programs.

 Their insight during the goal-setting and program-structuring phases of language learning to achieve these goals is indispensable.

 They will identify language learning skills and competencies as part of job descriptions and performance evaluations, ensuring that corporate training works smoothly with career advancement.

### Inclusive learning approaches

 A democratic approach is pivotal in designing language training programs. Hosting focus groups, surveys, online courses and feedback sessions allows employees to voice their preferences and learning curves.

 Remember, the goal for language learners isn’t just learning to speak a new language; it’s entwining it naturally with a person or team member’s personal growth, progress and success.

## Measuring success

 The adage ‘what gets measured, gets managed’ holds especially true for language training effectiveness.

### Developing KPIs for language skills

 How does [language learning and fluency impact your business](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) ? Is it a crucial aspect of employee engagement, enabling them to negotiate contracts for foreign services and foster cross-cultural teamwork?

 KPIs for [language training must be quantifiable and aligned with business](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) objectives. This might involve fluency tests, error rates in communication during language courses, or even increased customer satisfaction scores from multilingual support.

### Tracking progress and being flexible

 Training isn’t a linear path. By tracking students’ language-learning patterns and progress, you can identify bottlenecks in progress and areas for improvement.

 It’s imperative to have a feedback loop where the training plan can flex to adapt to changing business needs or individual students’ learning styles.
