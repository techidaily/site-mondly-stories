If you already had the French experience by visiting Paris and other attractions, you might already be in love with the language, and you can take the next steps to improve your skills.

 If you want to move to France to study or work abroad, and you speak the language at a native proficiency level, you can easily evolve and move to a different country where French-speaking people are the majority.

## What culture do you admire the most?

 A big part of learning a new language stems from the admiration you have for one culture or another. France is the epitome of culture, art, and a bohemian lifestyle. The French view culture as an essential part of their education and place it high on their pyramid of needs.

 French is also the language of love, so not only do you require it for work or university, but also to live the greatest romance of your life.
