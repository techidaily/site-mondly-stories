## Speak Like an Aussie: Top 100 Slang Guide

` __ Listen `

 You don’t really know a language until you’ve learned its [slang](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) . And when it comes to English, many people agree that Australian slang is the richest, liveliest and funniest slang you could learn. Sure, there’s always British English, but the Brits don’t call their barbecue “barbie”. And that’s a missed opportunity. Wouldn’t you agree? How can you have just a plain, dull barbecue when you could have a “barbie”? The Aussie slang is the best slang.

## Top 10 Popular Australian Slang Terms & Words

 Let’s start with the basics: core Australian slang vocabulary. Here’s a list of popular Australian slang terms you probably heard before but didn’t know what they meant.

### 1._Ta_ – Thank you

 You can also use “thanks heaps” when you are really grateful to someone for doing something for you or “cheers” to combine both “thank you”‌ and “goodbye” ‌in a single word. For example, “cheers” is a perfect choice for leaving the shop after the barista gives you your coffee.

### 2._Brekkie_ – Breakfast

 Although it sounds like breakfast for kids, brekkie is the Australian meal everyone has in the morning.

_“So… what did you have for brekkie today?”_

### 3._Barbie_ – Barbecue

Well, I don’t mind if you call me a “barbie girl” now.

### 4._Crikey!_ – An Exclamation of Surprise

 Famously used by Steve Irwin. It’s similar to the [British English slang](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) “blimey!”.

### 5._Cake Hole_ – Mouth

 There’s no better replacement for the word “mouth”. Why isn’t everybody using this?

### 6._Ankle-Biter_ – A Small or Young Child

It can also refer to a small, aggressive dog like a chihuahua.

### 7._Bogan_ – An Uncultured or Unsophisticated Person

 A “bogan” is an uncouth or unrefined person regarded as being of low social status. The term is usually pejorative, but it can also be regarded as a joke between friends.

### 8._Bush Telly_ – What You Watch at Night When You Are Camping

 You heard “telly” before, but “bush telly”? That’s a new one. Basically, when you are camping, you can’t watch traditional television, so you watch the “bush telly”: the campfire, the stars or just… the bush.

### 9._Bikkie_ – Biscuit

You’ll ask for a “bikkie” just to hear yourself say it.

 There’s also the very cute expression “to cost big bikkies”, meaning that something is very expensive.

### 10._Mate_ – Friend

_Oi, mate!_ This one’s a classic. You ought to use it. Additionally, you can also say “cobber”.

## Funny Australian Slang Phrases

### 1\. What’s the John Dory?

**What’s going on?**

 John Dory is an edible fish found on the coasts of Africa, Southeast Asia, New Zealand, and – of course – Australia. There’s no secret story to it apart from the fact that it just rhymes with ‘story’. So, instead of asking,_“what’s the story?”_ , in Australian slang, you ask_“what’s the John Dory?”_ .

### 2\. Chuck a sickie

**Call in sick without actually being sick.**

 If you ever took a day off work pretending to be sick, you’re guilty of chucking a sickie._“I’m chucking a sickie to go to the beach. Wanna join?”_

### 3\. Fair dinkum

**Honest, true or genuine.**

 Popular Australian exclamation often used to emphasize or seek confirmation (if used with the proper intonation) of the genuineness or truth of something._“This pork barbie is fair dinkum!”_

### 4\. Wrap your laughing gear ‘round that

**Eat that.**

 What’s your laughing gear? Your mouth, of course. So, when you wrap your laughing gear ‘round something, you… eat it. It can be used in either a friendly or threatening way.

### 5\. Carrying on like a pork chop

**To behave foolishly.**

Let me get my Australian slang translator for this one. 😅

It seems that this phrase has had a lot of variations:

* Carrying on like a pork chop in Jerusalem on a Saturday.
* Carrying on like a pork chop at a Jewish wedding.
* Carrying on like a pork chop in a synagogue.

 While the original message referred to an object that is out of place, the modern meaning has slightly shifted. So, when you hear someone using this Australian slang phrase, know that they are referring to someone who behaves foolishly, makes a fuss, complains, or rants.

### 6\. Dog’s breakfast

**Complete chaos, mess.**

 You can think of it this way: what does a dog’s breakfast consist of? Leftovers. Chicken bones or maybe a half-eaten pizza from last night. So, if something is really messy or disordered, then it looks like a dog’s breakfast.

### 7\. Do the Harry

**Disappear.**

 The complete phrase is known as “to do a Harold Holt”, which is rhyming slang for “bolt”. The story behind this Australian slang phrase is related to Harold Holt, the 17th prime minister of Australia. In 1967, Mr. Holt disappeared, presumably by drowning, while swimming along Victoria’s coast.

Some say he “did the bolt” from his responsibilities as a prime minister.

### 8\. No worries, mate, she’ll be apples

**Everything will be fine.**

 Also known as “she’ll be right”, these positive expressions reflect the Australian way of looking at unfortunate events. There’s no point in worrying about anything, as it will all be alright in the end.
