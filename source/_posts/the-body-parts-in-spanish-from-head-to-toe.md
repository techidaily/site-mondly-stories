## Body parts in Spanish: head

 Now that you know that ‘head’ in Spanish is_‘cabeza’_ , let’s move forward to all the body parts you can find on and in the head. For example, did you know that ‘brain’ in Spanish is ‘cerebro’? If you are an X-men fan and know that ‘cerebro’ is also the name of a machine used by Professor X to amplify his telepathic ability, this one won’t be too difficult to remember.

## Body parts in Spanish: from neck to torso

 Time to explore the area where the most important organ lies: the heart. Some will argue that_el cerebro_ (‘the brain’) is more important, but the heart (‘el corazón’) is the one pumping blood all over the body. By the way, did you know that every day your heart beats about 115,000 times and pumps about 6,000-7,500 liters (1,500-2,000 gallons) of blood? To better take care of it, make sure you laugh a lot. Laughing reduces stress, boosts your immune system, and makes your heart stronger.

 But let’s not get cold feet and discover what are the Spanish names of the body parts located between neck and torso.

* (the) neck — _(el) cuello_
* (the) organs — _(los) órganos_
* (the) heart — _(el) corazón_

* (the) liver — _(el) hígado_
* (the) kidneys — _(los) riñones_
* (the) intestines — _(los) intestinos_

## Grammar rules and practice

 In terms of grammar, there’s nothing too difficult when it comes to the parts of the body in Spanish. You just have to remember that, in Spanish, names of parts of the body are more likely to be accompanied by the definite articles_el, la, los_ and_las_ (meaning ‘the’) instead of the usual English possessive adjectives like ‘my’, ‘your’, ‘our’ or ‘their’.

For example:

* _Me duele **el** pie._ (‘**My** foot hurts.’)
* _Protéjase **las** manos con guantes._ (‘Protect **your** hands with gloves.’)

 However, Spanish doesn’t shy away from using possessive adjectives when things need to be clear.

* _**Sus** brazos son atléticos._ (‘**His** arms are athletic.’)
* _Sal de **tu** pecho._ (‘Get it off **your** chest.’)

 Additionally, there are situations when Spanish uses the definite article, but English drops even the possessive adjective.

* _Tengo **los** ojos azules._ (I have blue eyes.)
