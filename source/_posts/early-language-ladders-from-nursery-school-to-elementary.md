## Early Language Ladders: From Nursery School To Elementary

 In today’s globalized world,**Spanish for kids** stands out as an invaluable learning opportunity. Recognizing the value of bilingualism, it’s vital to tap into the receptiveness of your children’s young minds and introduce them to Spanish while it’s still very easy to learn. Encouraging them to start learning Spanish for kids now will equip them with a skill they can use and appreciate throughout their lives as they mature into global citizens.

 The goal is to instill a lasting love for this Romance language and make learning Spanish a fascinating adventure! So, let’s discover what are the best resources to help kids learn Spanish fast. Whether you’re thinking Spanish songs, books, or cartoons – they’re all included in this comprehensive guide.



## Introduction to Spanish for Kids

 Teaching the little ones anything – from dinosaur names to Spanish for kids – is extremely simple if you know what methods to use. There are no ‘lazy’ children that ‘won’t study’. Only busy adults. If you give them your time and knowledge, kids’ minds will almost literally absorb all kinds of information, from languages to poetry or basic math, in no time.

 How? Well, their brains have a less developed prefrontal cortex. Thus, they tend to use their imagination much more than us. While adults experience functional fixedness and see everything exactly as it is, **children create unexpected connections to help them learn faster.** Obviously, the difficulty level is different. So adults shouldn’t blame their ‘old’ and ‘dusty’ minds for not retaining information but for their lack of imagination.

 Meanwhile, children have no problem associating new words with seemingly unrelated notions they already know. For example, my 4-year-old nephew associates the word_aburrido_ (‘bored’) with_burro_ (‘donkey’) – a Spanish word he already knew. The connection is Eeyore, the iconic donkey from Winnie the Pooh. He says that “Eeyore always looks sad, tired, and bored”.
