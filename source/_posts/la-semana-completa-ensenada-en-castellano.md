## La Semana Completa Ense√±ada en Castellano

 ¬°Hola, Spanish language aficionado! Welcome to another essential [Spanish lesson](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) about the days of the week in Spanish.

 The days of the week are probably one of the first things you learn not just in Spanish but in any language. Even as a child, when you started speaking your native language, you started with ‚Äúmom‚Äù, ‚Äúdad‚Äù,[‚Äúhello‚Äù](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) , then you probably learned the parts of the body, how to count to ten, the colors and ‚Äì naturally ‚Äì the days of the week. Otherwise, how would you have been able to set up meetings with the other cool toddlers in the park? The days of the week are crucial for every toddler! üòÇ

 But no more talking. Let‚Äôs dive in and find out how to say Monday in Spanish.

 Before you can say that that‚Äôs easy peasy lemon squeezy, let‚Äôs look at some rules:

* **days of the week are not capitalized in Spanish** ‚Äì unless, of course, they appear at the beginning of a sentence;
* **days of the week are all masculine in Spanish** ‚Äì this means you‚Äôll always have to use masculine articles ‚Äì_el_ ,_los_ ,_un_ and_algunos ‚Äì_ and masculine adjectives when talking about the days of the week. For example, if you want to say ‚Äúthe last Friday of the month was rainy‚Äù in Spanish, you say ‚Äú**el** √∫ltim**o** viernes del mes fue lluvios**o** ‚Äù;
* **‚Äúon Monday‚Äù in Spanish can‚Äôt be translated verbatim** ‚Äì for example, ‚ÄúI will pay you a visit on Monday‚Äù translates to ‚Äúte har√© una visita**el** lunes‚Äù in Spanish. Although you could be tempted to say ‚Äúen‚Äù, don‚Äôt do it! The only correct way to talk about something happening on a specific day in Spanish is by using the pronouns_el_ and_los_ (e.g. ‚Äúshe visits her grandma every Sunday‚Äù will translate to ‚Äúella visita a su abuela todos**los** domingos‚Äù)
* **to make a day of the week plural, you add an_s_**  (if it doesn‚Äôt already end in one) ‚Äì this means_lunes_ will remain_lunes_ for the plural form_los lunes_ , but_domingo_ will become_domingos_ ‚Äì_los domingos._ In other words, the only days that get an_s_ for their plural form are_s√°bado_ and_domingo_ :_s√°bados y domingos._
