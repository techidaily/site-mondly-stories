### **Better Educational Performance**

Bilingual students have been found to possess a heightened intelligence. Numerous studies by York University have shown that bilingual students are more focused and less distracted than monolingual students. Students who have acquired bilingual education, that is, taught using their second language, go ahead in life to have better shots at bilingual jobs.

### **Greater Job Opportunities**

There are bilingual jobs that require employees to act as representatives at branches located in different international communities.
