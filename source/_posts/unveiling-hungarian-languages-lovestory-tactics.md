While it can be challenging, it will also lead to some hilarious misunderstandings more often than not. And what spices up the romance if not humor?

## How to say ‘I love you’ in Hungarian

 The word you are looking for if you want to say **_I love you_ in Hungarian is_Szeretlek_**  .

 While English uses three different words – I love you –, Hungarian makes use of suffixes and gets it done in one word. Thus, the_**\-lek**_ at the end accounts for “you.”

 Besides, unlike other languages, Hungarian is a non-gendered language. This means you can say_Szeretlek_ to someone of either sex.

 Supposing you want to find out if your feelings are reciprocated, you can ask_Te szeretsz engem?_ which means “Do you love me?”.

 Last but not least, **the word for “love” in Hungarian is_szeretet_ .**
