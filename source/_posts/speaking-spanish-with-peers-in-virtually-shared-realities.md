## Speaking Spanish with Peers in Virtually Shared Realities

Enter a room in our multiplayer module and practice your Spanish with people from all around the world as if you were in the same room.

It currently provides users with 30 different languages ranging from those more commonly learned (like [English, Japanese, Farsi](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) , Mandarin, and Spanish) to languages usually only studied by native speakers and linguistics aficionados (like Finnish and Hungarian). 14 of the available learning choices in Mondly VR rank among the hardest for native English speakers to learn.
