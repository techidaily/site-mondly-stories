## How To Tell Time In Spanish - A Complete Guide For Beginners

_¿Que hora es?_ demands an answer! And no, we’re not talking about the Mexican soap opera for people who only had 3 weeks of Spanish in the 4th grade_(wink wink)_ . In all seriousness, how do you reply to the question that has been on everybody’s lips at one point? How do you tell the time in Spanish? Well, it’s time_(wink wink)_ to find out.

 I know what you think and it’s true. We’re lucky enough to live in an era of rapid technological advancements. Even if you don’t own a watch, you probably have a smartphone. Asking or telling the time in Spanish or any other language may seem obsolete. But what if your phone’s battery is dead? I for one had a pretty interesting experience when I had to survive one week without a phone. I kept asking random people the time to make sure I wasn’t late and they looked at me like I was some kind of an alien. So yeah, knowing how to tell the time in Spanish can make all the difference!

 One more thing! If you’ve learned [how to count in Spanish](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) , it will be extremely easy for you.

But first things first.

## ¿Que hora es? – how to ask for the time in Spanish

 In order to tell the time in Spanish, you’ll first have to learn how to properly ask for the time in Spanish. You can never be too cautious. I’m just making sure you’re not missing that_fiesta española_ you spent weeks thinking about!

 In addition to the now well-known_**¿que hora es?**_ which literally translates to “what hour is it?”, you can also ask_**¿tiene hora?**_ which is literally “do you have the hour?”. Easy enough!

## The basics of Spanish time

 To_decir la hora_ (“tell the time”) in Spanish, there are a few simple rules you’ll have to know.

 First of all, always use the verb**_ser_** . No, not_estar_ , but_ser_ . If you don’t know what [Spanish verbs](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) are all about, you might want to check this little [guide for beginners](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) . To put it simply, time is a permanent entity that requires the use of the verb_ser_ .

 Secondly, remember that only when talking about one o’clock, you’ll need to use the **third person singular form of_ser_ .** For all the other eleven hours, you can safely go with the plural form. Here’s how to tell the time in Spanish if the time is on the hour:

* _**Es** la una._ – It’s one o’clock.
* _**Son** las dos._ – It’s two o’clock.
* _**Son** las tres._ – It’s three o’clock.
* _**Son** las cuatro._ – It’s four o’clock.
* _**Son** las cinco._ – It’s five o’clock.
* _**Son** las seis._ – It’s six o’clock.
* _**Son** las siete._ – It’s seven o’clock.
* _**Son** las ocho._ – It’s eight o’clock.
* _**Son** las nueve._ – It’s nine o’clock.
* _**Son** las diez._ – It’s ten o’clock.
* _**Son** las once._ – It’s eleven o’clock.
* _**Son** las doce._ – It’s twelve o’clock.

 As you can see, the feminine article (_la/las_) is used before the number. Why is that? Well, because it refers to_la hora_ . But again, remember that the singular form**_la_** will only be used in the case of**“one o’clock”** because we’re talking about a single hour.

_**Nota bene:**_ If you prefer to use the 24-hour clock, you should say**_son las dieciséis_** **(“it’s 16:00”)** instead of **_son las cuatro_ (“it’s 4 o’clock p.m.”).** But that will require a little more studying on your part. Don’t worry though. Spanish numbers are just as easy as learning how to tell the time. You can master them with Mondly faster than you can say Jack Robinson. You can get started [here](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5345&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5345?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5345?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es) .

### How do you say the time in Spanish after 30?

 Now, the time is not always on the hour. So how do you say “half past”, “quarter past” and “quarter to” in Spanish? There are only two new words you need to remember:_**media**_ and_**cuarto**_ .

* If it’s**half past** the hour in Spanish, use the phrase_**y media**_ ;
* If it’s a**quarter past** the hour, use the phrase_**y cuarto**_ ;
* If it’s**a quarter until the hour,** use the phrase**_menos cuarto_** .

Here are some examples:

* 2:30 –_Son las dos y media._ – It’s two thirty.
* 1:15 –_Es la una y cuarto._ – It’s one fifteen.
* 5:45 –_Son las seis menos cuarto._ – It’s a quarter until six.

 Telling time in Spanish – a visual guide

### Hour + minutes in Spanish time

 Wanna be a little more specific? Here’s how Spanish time works when you need to indicate the exact number of minutes that have past from the hour.

 The simplest formula is **_es/son_ \+ las + hour + number of minutes.** For example, if you want to say that it’s_**3:29**_ , you’ll say**_son las tres veintinueve._**

 Thus, the same as in English, there will be two ways in which you can indicate some hours in Spanish. If it’s 8:15, you can say:

* _Son las ocho y cuarto._ (“it’s a quarter past eight”)
* _Son las ocho y quince._ (“it’s eight and fifteen minutes”)

### Different ways of telling time in Spanish

 There are three formulas of telling time in Spanish. Here are different ways of telling it’s 3:10:

* _es/son_ +_las_ \+ hour + number of minutes –_**Son las tres diez**_
* _es/son_ +_las_ \+ hour + y + number of minutes –**_Son las tres y diez_**
* _es/son_ +_las_ \+ hour + con + number of minutes –**_Son las tres con diez_**

 Which one do you prefer? Additionally, if we also count it_cuarto_ and_media_ , there are no less than four different ways to tell the time in Spanish. And you’ve just mastered them all!

## How to indicate the time of day in Spanish

 If you are using the 12-hour clock, you sometimes might want to also point out the time of day. For instance, “it’s two in the afternoon” translates to_**son las dos de la tarde**_ in Spanish. Not too complicated, is it? Here are some more times of day that might come in handy:

* _mediodía_ – midday
* _mañana_ – in the morning
* _noche_ – at night
* _madrugada_ – the middle of the night
* _medianoche_ – midnight
* _amanecer_ – dawn
* _tarde_ – in the afternoon

 To indicate that an event occurs at a specific time, use the formula **a +_la(s)_ \+ time** :_La clase de español empieza a las nueve_ – “The Spanish class begins at 9”.

### Other useful time phrases in Spanish

* _por la mañana_ – in the morning
* _por la tarde_ – in the afternoon
* _de la tarde_ – in the afternoon
* _al mediodía_ – at noon
* _a la medianoche_ – at midnight
* _por la noche_ – in the evening or night
* _de la noche_ – in the evening or night
* _la mañana_ – morning or tomorrow
* _mañana por la mañana_ – tomorrow morning
* _pasado mañana_ – the day after tomorrow
* _tarde_ – late
* _temprano_ – early
* _en punto_ – exactly or sharp (son _las ocho en punto_ – “it’s exactly eight o’clock”)
* _ayer_ – yesterday
* _anteayer_ – the day before yesterday
* _anoche_ – last night
* _la noche anterior, anteanoche_ – the night before last
* _el lunes que viene_ – next Monday
* _el lunes pasado_ – last Monday
* _la semana que viene_ – next week
* _semana por medio_ – every other week
* _la semana pasada_ – last week
* _el año que viene_ – next year
* _el año pasado_ – last year
* _durante el día_ – during the day
