## Sea-Talk for Swashbucklers Only

 Ahoy, maties! Avast, ye! Stop what you are doing.**If it‚Äôs September 19, then it‚Äôs International Talk Like a Pirate Day!** The perfect excuse to drink industrial quantities of rum, grunt, growl, dress like Jack Sparrow, walk your parrot pet on the shoulder and call everyone you meet a scallywag. Blimey! That sure sounds like a lot of fun. Arr! So let‚Äôs walk the plank and see what‚Äôs this all about.

## The origins of Talk Like a Pirate Day

 It was June 6, 1995, when John Baur and Mark Summers ‚Äì later known by their pirate names Ol‚Äô Chumbucket and Cap‚Äôn Slappy ‚Äì played racquetball. The story says one of them got injured during the game and reacted with an outburst of ‚ÄúArrr!‚Äù. Thus the Talk Like a Pirate Day was born. Out of respect for the observance of World War II‚Äôs D-Day on the 6th of June, the soon-to-be world-renowned pirates decided to choose Summers‚Äô now ex-wife‚Äôs birthday ‚Äì September 19 ‚Äì to celebrate pirate lingo.

 At first, Baur and Summers celebrated Talk Like a Pirate Day as an inside joke between two friends. But a few years later they sent a letter to Dave Barry, a syndicated humor columnist, who liked the idea and released it into the world. The rest‚Ä¶ is history.

 Over the years, the idea gained a lot of notoriety and is now celebrated internationally by people and brands everywhere. For example, in 2008, to celebrate the day, Facebook introduced a pirate-translated version of its website.

## The pirate accent: how to talk like a pirate

 **Arr! All right, ye‚Äô bilge rat! It‚Äôs time to teach ye‚Äô how to talk like a real pirate!**

 ‚ÄúAhoy, matey!‚Äù by Austin Neill¬©

 All you have to do is talk in a deep, gravelly voice, grunt and growl a lot, use insults abundantly, yell ‚Äúarr!‚Äù every now and then, mumble incoherently from all the rum you‚Äôve drunk, slur your words, give up g‚Äôs and v‚Äôs in most words, and replace ‚Äúyou‚Äù and your‚Äú with ‚Äúye‚Äù and ‚Äúyer‚Äù.

Easy peasy, ain‚Äôt it?
