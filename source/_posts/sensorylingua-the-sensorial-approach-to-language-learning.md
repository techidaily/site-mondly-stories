## SensoryLingua: The Sensorial Approach to Language Learning

 Say goodbye to dry memorization techniques that lack context and welcome the magic of**Mondly VR Multiplayer** into your life. We combined**the wizardry of virtual reality** with**language learning** to give you a revolutionary and intuitive approach to learn languages like you never knew you could.

## How does it work?

 Eager to**practice your French or Spanish** in a **[REAL‌ conversation](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) ?** Put your VR headset on, choose an avatar, select your native language and let’s get you talking! You will be automatically assigned to a VR room together with a maximum of 11 other participants where you will socialize and practice the language you want to learn “face to face” as if you were in the same room.

 Using**speech recognition** and**intelligent suggestions** accompanied by**real-time translations,** Mondly VR will make sure you won’t get stuck with words you can’t remember and the conversation will go seamlessly.

## Connect with people from all around the world

 One of the things we love most about the Multiplayer module is that it brings people together. Every new session gives you the chance to interact with people just like you: people that want to learn Spanish, French or maybe English and don’t have a conversation partner to practice conversations.

 This is a unique chance to connect and learn languages together in a **singular hands-on VR experience that will shape you into a better and more natural speaker.**
