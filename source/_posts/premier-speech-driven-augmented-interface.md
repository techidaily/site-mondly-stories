## Premier Speech-Driven Augmented Interface

 Today, we are thrilled to announce the arrival of the [AR module in Mondly](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) – the first Augmented Reality experience in the world that uses speech recognition to help you learn languages.

 The innovative learning app introduces you to a virtual character that will guide you through a new world where interactive objects with spectacular appearances make learning happen naturally. Powered by chatbot technology, the virtual teacher takes learning a step further by engaging you in conversations, giving instant feedback on pronunciation.

 To create the experience, we worked in close collaboration with Google for the past 6 months.

Here’s a video showcasing Mondly AR:

 The new experience we created helps you develop a strong sense of the language you want to learn through highly realistic visual lessons and purposeful conversations. This approach is aiming to stimulate you to learn languages not because you have to, but because [it’s genuinely fun.](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875)

 Mondly, the lifelike language learning assistant uses augmented reality to bring language lessons to life. She has the ability to make planets, animals and musical instruments magically appear into your own environment, creating a scenery where you can walk up and around these virtual creations and even interact with them. This spatial interaction creates a truly immersive experience which was made possible using the latest augmented reality technologies such as ARCore from Google.

 Just as futuristic, the chatbot experience from Mondly aims to be the closest thing to a real interaction. Mondly understands spoken language, replies with a human voice, changes her outfit to match the topic of discussion and uses gestures and facial expressions to create dynamic dialogues.

Alex Iliescu, our CEO, spoke about the launch:

> _We started working on Mondly AR in August 2017 and by the time [Blade Runner 2049](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856101/) was released, we already had a working demo. Watching Blade Runner 2049 made me realize that we were beginning to build the future. To me, Joi (the holographic companion of officer K) looked like a super advanced version of Mondly – the character we were creating. They can both understand speech, reply with a human voice and change outfits. Of course, Mondly is not as smart and realistic as Joi. Yet. But she can teach you 7 languages. And this is just the beginning._
