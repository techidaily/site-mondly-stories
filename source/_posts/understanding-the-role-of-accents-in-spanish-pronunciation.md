## Understanding the Role of Accents in Spanish Pronunciation

 Navigating Spanish accents—or accents in any language that utilizes them—can be particularly challenging for individuals whose first language doesn’t include accent marks. How does one type Spanish accent marks on a standard keyboard? How does the pronunciation of a word shift with the addition of an accent mark? Do these marks affect the stress of a word? And how can one remember when they’re necessary?

 If you’re not yet familiar with the primary rules of Spanish accents, these questions might seem daunting. However, it’s crucial not to get discouraged! Accents play a vital role in languages that incorporate them—not only in Spanish. It’s essential to understand that the presence or absence of an accent mark can drastically alter the meaning of a word. Mastering the use of accents is indispensable for anyone aiming to become proficient in Spanish. Here are the key facts you need to know about Spanish accents.



## Spanish Accent Marks

 Spanish accent marks or Spanish accents can also be referred to as diacritics, diacritical marks or diacritical signs. These represent an extra symbol or glyph added to a letter.

The Spanish language has three types of accent marks:

* **Tilde**
* **Acute accents**
* **Diaeresis**

### Tilde

 The tilde is only applied to the letter “n”, creating the character “ñ”, which is considered a separate letter in the Spanish alphabet and appears as such in dictionaries. Also known as_la tilde de la eñe_ or_la virgulilla_ , “ñ” appears in words such as_niño_ (“child”),_mañana_ (“tomorrow”),_señor_ (“mister, sir”),_año_ (“year”) and even_español_ (“Spanish” – the language).

### Diaeresis

 The diaeresis is only found on the letter “u”, marked by two dots above it_(ü)_ . It indicates that the “u” should be pronounced independently, as a separate vowel, not as part of a digraph or diphthong. Although rare, the diaeresis in Spanish is typically placed immediately after “g” or immediately before “e” or “i” in a word. In case you were wondering, yes, it is distinct from an umlaut, which denotes a sound shift.

### Acute Accent

 The acute accent, represented by a short diagonal line above vowels, is the most common accent mark in Spanish. Acute accents occur only once per word and their purpose is to stress words, distinguish between otherwise identical words and indicate questions.

## All Spanish Accents Letters

* **á**
* **é**
* **í**
* **ó**
* **ú**
* **ñ**
* **ü**

**Spanish uses accent marks on only six different letters** **.** Accent marks are never applied to any other letters in the alphabet, so it’s easy to remember them. Here’s how Spanish accent letters are grouped by type of accent marks:

* **_á, é, í, ó, ú_ use acute accents;**
* **_ñ_ uses the tilde;**
* **_ü_ uses the diaeresis.**

## Spanish Pronunciation Without Accent Marks

 In Spanish, having [accent](https://www.britannica.com/topic/accent-linguistics) marks makes speaking easier because they indicate the correct pronunciation of a word by telling you which syllable to stress or emphasize. But how do you pronounce Spanish words without accent marks? Here are the two main rules for how to pronounce [Spanish words](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) without accent marks:

 1\. If the word ends with a vowel, the letter “n” or the letter “s”, the stress is on the**next to last syllable.** For example:

* _com-pu-ta-**DO** \-ra_ (“computer” in English)
* _her-**MO** \-so_ (“beautiful” in English)

 2\. If the word ends with a consonant (other than “n” or “s”), the stress is on the**last syllable.** For example:

* _fe-**LIZ**_  (“happy” in English)
* _pro-fe-**SOR**_  (“professor” in English)

## Spanish Pronunciation With Accents Marks

 If your Spanish word has an acute accent, ignore the previously mentioned rules and**stress the syllable that contains the accent.** You’ll quickly become accustomed to pronouncing and writing these words. A helpful option for practice is to use the Mondly Chatbot, where you can both SEE and HEAR the words.

 In Spanish, stress and accents are closely related as they help distinguish between words in both pronunciation and meaning. For example,_‘ella mandó una carta’_ means ‘she sent a letter’, while_‘yo mando una carta’_ means ‘I send a letter’. Here are some additional examples where accent marks can completely change the meaning of a word in Spanish:

| Spanish words with accent marks | Spanish words without accent marks | Example sentence using both words                              | Translation                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _tú_ (you)                      | _tu_ (your)                        | _Tú tienes un perro muy bonito. ¿Es tu única mascota?_         | You have a very cute dog. Is it your only pet?                   |
| _té_ (tea)                      | _te_ (you)                         | _Te recomiendo que tomes mucho té._                            | I recommend that you drink a lot of tea.                         |
| _cómo_ (how/what)               | _como_ (like, as)                  | _¿Cómo se llama tu colega? ¿Es tan inteligente como Cristian?_ | What is your colleague's name? Is he as smart as Cristian?       |
| _él_ (he)                       | _el_ (the)                         | _A él le gusta el vino._                                       | He likes the wine.                                               |
| _sí_ (yes)                      | _si_ (if)                          | _Sí, quiero probar el chorizo pero solo si no es picante._     | Yes, I want to try the pork sausage but only if it is not spicy. |

 As you can see, Spanish differentiates between homonyms by using accent marks. Once you understand how Spanish accent marks make everything easier, you’ll love learning about them!

## Spanish Accents Rules

 Acute accents are necessary in Spanish to indicate the stressed syllable, especially in the following cases:

1. When a word ends in a vowel, -n, or -s and the stress is on the last syllable. Example: _camión_ (truck)
2. When a word ends in a consonant (excluding -n or -s) or a vowel and the stress is on the second to last syllable. Example: _fácil_ (easy)
3. When the stress falls on the antepenultimate syllable (the syllable before the second to last). Example: _político_ (politician)
4. When the stress is on the syllable before the antepenultimate, especially with Spanish pronouns in gerunds, imperatives, or Spanish infinitives. Example: _cómpramelo_ (buy it for me)

### Exception

 Words ending in -mente have two stressed syllables, complicating Spanish accent placement. What you can do is remove the ending (-mente), follow the above rules, then add the ending back on and stress both the accented Spanish letter and MEN-te.

### Question Words

 All Spanish question words require an acute accent, even if they don’t have one in declarative sentences. That’s basically how you differentiate between interrogative words: when they are used in a question, they have an accent; when used to answer a question or make a statement, they don’t.

 For example, when you ask_‘_ _¿cuánto tengo que pagar?’_ (how much do I have to pay?) you use an acute accent, but when you say_‘tú no sabes cuanto te voy a extrañar’_ (you don’t know how much I will miss you), you don’t.
