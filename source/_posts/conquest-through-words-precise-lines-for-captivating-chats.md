## Conquest Through Words: Precise Lines for Captivating Chats

 Think of it this way: if flirting is an art, then you are the artist, and the**best** **pick up lines in English** (and beyond) are your works of art_(we’re exaggerating a bit for the sake of emphasis, but bear with us)_ . Would you like your Tinder match – or worse: your crush – to think that the art you create is cheap? Of course not. That’s why it’s crucial to choose your pick up lines carefully and not overdo it. Remember: the best pick up lines are not cringe or dirty but classy, smooth, funny, and charming. That’s the kind of English pick up lines that actually work in real life.

![chocolate in different languages](https://media.giphy.com/media/wrBURfbZmqqXu/giphy.gif "Elevate Your Flirting Game: The Best Pick-Up Lines In English 2")

 Lucky for you, our list includes the**best** **pick up lines in English guaranteed to make a good first impression.** Your only job will be to put them in the right context and act them well: in a tongue-in-cheek kind of way. The purpose is to make the other person blush, smile, even laugh or go \*heart eyes emoji\*. Not cringe and roll their eyes in annoyance.

[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pickup%20line) defines a**“pick up line”** as **“a prepared remark used by a person to start a conversation with a stranger they are interested in having a romantic relationship with”** . In other words, a pick up line is an icebreaker or a conversation opener. So, let’s see what are some funny pick up lines in English that can get the conversation going. Let’s go!
