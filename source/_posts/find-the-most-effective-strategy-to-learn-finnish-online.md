## Finnish, the language that inspired Tolkien to invent Elvish

[Finnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish%5Flanguage) (or Suomi, as Finns would say) is the official language of Finland (alongside Swedish) and one of the 24 official languages of the European Union. Additionally, there are also some Finnish-speaking minorities in Russia, Norway and Sweden.

 The Finnish language is a member of the Finno-Ugric group of the Uralic language family and although it had its first comprehensive writing system in the 16th century, it became an official language of Finland only in 1863.

 While the FSI (Foreign Service Institute) of the US government classifies Finnish as a tier 4 language (of 5 tiers) in terms of learning difficulty for native English speakers, Dr. Riitta-Liisa Valijarvi, senior teaching fellow in Finnish Language at University College London, says Finnish doesn’t deserve its reputation as one of the [hardest languages to learn](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) .

 “There are many grammatical cases (…) and the vocabulary is not familiar. But the sound system is very easy, very basic, and that is what [inspired \[Tolkien’s\] Elvish](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34063157#:~:text=On%20Thursday%20JRR%20Tolkien's%20early,Kullervo%2C%22%20Tolkien%20called%20him.) ,” she says.

 As probably die-hard_The_ _Lord of the Rings_ fans already know, J. R. R. Tolkien took inspiration from Finnish to create the Elvish language. Although he never visited Finland and didn’t even [speak Finnish](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5404&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5404?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=fi&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5404?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=fi) fluently, Tolkien became captivated by the language. And for good reason! The Finnish language is notorious for the way it sounds to non-speakers who often say Finnish seems like a language from another universe or an alternate dimension.

 “Helsinki, Finland” by Carlos “Grury” Santos©

## Finnish learning made easy

 Let’s look at the bright side and see why Finnish is not actually that hard to learn.

 First of all,**Finnish has no grammatical gender.** This means that there is no distinction between masculine, feminine, or neuter (not even in the personal pronouns)._Hän_ , for example, can mean both “he” and “she”.

 Additionally,**Finnish also has no articles** as we do in English.

 Secondly – and most importantly –**Finnish is pronounced as it is written.** There is almost a 100% correspondence between letters and their sounds so you’ll have no problem reading Finnish even though you may not know what the words actually mean.

 Thirdly,**the Finnish language loves working with literal words.** And you’ll love it too. A lot of Finnish words have very literal English translations that make learning super fun. For example, a computer is a “knowledge machine”_(tietokone)_ , a treadmill is a “running carpet”_(juoksumatto)_ and a refrigerator is an “ice cupboard”_(jääkaappi)_ .

 Another interesting thing about Finnish is that it has some prepositions, but more postpositions. “What are postpositions?”, you’ll say. Well, postpositions are similar to prepositions, but they come**after** the word that they add meaning to.

 Furthermore, – this doesn’t necessarily make Finnish easier to learn, but it’s a valuable piece of information for every Finnish beginner –**Finnish is an agglutinative language.** This means that words can be formed by attaching together pieces that add meaning to the word.

 As you can see, Finnish truly fascinating and we promise you’ll have a great time [learning it with Mondly](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5404&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5404?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=fi&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5404?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=fi) !
