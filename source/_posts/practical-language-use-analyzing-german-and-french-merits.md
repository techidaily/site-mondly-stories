## What culture do you admire the most?

 A big part of learning a new language stems from the admiration you have for one culture or another. France is the epitome of culture, art, and a bohemian lifestyle. The French view culture as an essential part of their education and place it high on their pyramid of needs.

 French is also the language of love, so not only do you require it for work or university, but also to live the greatest romance of your life. If you’re a fan of French cinema, which includes big names like Godard, Truffaut, and Rohmer, learning French will help you become an expert and understand the culture on a different level.

 Germany can offer you just as many attractions when it comes to the artistic fields. Not just a place for businesses to grow, but also for creatives to express themselves, the country has much to offer. For example, Berlin is becoming the go-to place for artists all over the world, due to its distinct approach to nightlife, cultural events, and a strong sense of self-expression.
