 Holidays are always “just around the corner”. You dream about them. You measure your working time in months/weeks/days remaining until the vacation.

* _¡Buenas tardes!_ – Good afternoon!
* _¡Buenas noches!_ – Good evening!

## 3\. Basic Spanish for travelers that need help

 In this situation, you can also use the basic Spanish travel phrases for conversation that were mentioned in the first bullet points. Don’t hesitate to ask for help if you need it. Taxi drivers, for example, are usually nice people and will surely answer your questions. They might even give you travel tips that only locals know.  
 The questions that will help you the most when you are asking for help are_¿Dónde está…?_ meaning_Where is…?_ and_¿Dónde hay…?_ that is basically the same thing but it is generally used together with indefinite articles like_un_ or_una_ .

* _el puesto de venta de billetes_ – the ticket sales stand
