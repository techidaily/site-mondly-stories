## Cocoa Communication: Expressing Chocolate Across Cultures

 Chocolate, the same as love, brings sweetness and joy to our hearts. When life happens, chocolate helps. When it touches your taste buds, you taste heaven. Every chocolate lover knows that feeling. And don’t you feel as powerful as a Greek god or goddess tasting ambrosia for the first time? Because that’s chocolate: so good it becomes addictive, so yummy it makes you happy, so fine it makes you invincible, so creamy it makes you salivate right now.

 Now imagine that the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao) was unknown to Europeans until the 16th century. Just imagine that! 16 sad centuries with no chocolate. But after the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was finally imported to Europe and within about 100 years it became notorious all over the continent. People loved it.

 Today, scientists have even confirmed that chocolate is amazing for you. Besides the obvious **release of feel-good endorphins,[chocolate contains antioxidants](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/7-health-benefits-dark-chocolate#section5) that improve overall cardiovascular health.** But don’t drown yourself in chocolate yet. It seems that too much chocolate can cause serious health problems and can even [kill you](https://lostinscience.wordpress.com/2012/10/11/death-by-chocolate/) . So don’t overeat it. You know what they say: “everything good in life is either illegal, immoral, or fattening”.

## International Chocolate Day

 Chocoholics such as you or me love chocolate so much they celebrate its existence every single day. But did you know there are [multiple days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%5FChocolate%5FDay) throughout the year dedicated to the greatness of chocolate? The most commonly accepted such day is**World Chocolate Day** **on July 7,** but people also celebrate**International Chocolate Day** **on September 13** (the birth date of Milton S. Hershey, founder of Hershey’s Chocolate!).

 And, if you live in the U.S., you’ll have even MORE official days to celebrate different types of chocolate. The U.S. National Confectioners Association did a complete list of [candy holidays](https://www.candyusa.com/life-candy/candy-holidays/) which includes a National Chocolate Covered Cherry Day in January, a Chocolate Mint Day in February, a National Chocolate Caramel Day, a National Chocolate-Covered Raisin Day and an entire week dedicated to American Chocolate in March. And that’s only three months into the year. Imagine how many more “chocolate days” the U.S. has until the end of the year.
