## Diverse Vocabularies, Common Educators Goal

 Every year, on October 5, we are honoring teachers and their role in providing quality education for students everywhere. Also known as International Teachers Day, World Teachers’ Day was established in 1994 and it observes the anniversary of the adoption of the 1966 ILO/UNESCO Recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers. This [Recommendation](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000160495) set the standard regarding the rights and the responsibilities of the teachers concerning their education, employment, recruitment, and teaching conditions.

 “The teacher” by neonbrand©

[Teachers are the best people](https://www.myenglishteacher.eu/) in the world. They always go above and beyond to support their students. They change lives. And one day is not enough to thank them for all their dedication to education.

 Our [World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/teachers-and-professors) shows that, in 2014, there were almost 90 million teachers in the world. On Teachers’ Day, thank at least one of them and let’s make this world a better place.
