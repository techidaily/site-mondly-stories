Enhancing employees’[language skills can improve](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) interpersonal relationships and help integrate non-native speakers, facilitating more effective communication and collaboration. Imagine your multilingual employees navigating international commerce with ease, communicating with clients in their native language. This not only fosters better business relationships but also enhances understanding of client needs.

 Beyond its role as a communication tool, language learning also serves as a productivity enhancer. Enhancing an employee’s reading skills, intellectual capabilities, and efficiency in task completion are just a few of the numerous benefits. Employees with language training often exhibit higher confidence in meetings, contributing to a more cohesive workplace environment, personal growth, and team morale.

 But the benefits extend beyond immediate team dynamics. Providing language training can:

* Strengthen employee loyalty
* Attract a more diverse and talented workforce
* Enrich the company’s cultural dynamics
* Infuse fresh perspectives into the workplace
* Make it a hotbed of creativity and innovation.

### Overcoming language barriers

 Language [barriers](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) can be a real thorn in the side of business progress.

## Top Language Learning Platforms: Features and Benefits

 Language learning platforms, in the modern digital era, have drastically transformed the methods of language acquisition. They offer features such as picture-word association, speech recognition, and multiple choice quizzes, crafted to cater to various learning preferences. Among these platforms, the best language learning software, such as Duolingo, provides extensive content gratis, making language learning an accessible option for all. With the help of language software, mastering a new language has never been easier.

 Diversity in language offerings is a salient feature of many platforms. For instance, Babbel teaches 14 languages, while Drops by Kahoot! provides a selection of 50 languages. Some platforms, like Babbel, support advanced learners with niche vocabulary and conversations, while others, including Drops by Kahoot!, focus on vocabulary building.

 Certain platforms like Pimsleur emphasize listening and speaking through 30-minute audio lessons, ideal for hands-free learning. On the other hand, Rosetta Stone is highlighted for its structured approach benefiting beginners and intermediate learners. These platforms also utilize proficiency tests to place learners at the correct difficulty level, thereby personalizing the learning experience.

 While cost may be a concern, bear in mind that the quality of the service is often reflected in its price. Some factors to consider when choosing a language learning platform include:

* Pimsleur: higher monthly cost, but offers additional features like live lessons, podcasts, and games
* Babbel: offers value through additional features like live lessons, podcasts, and games
* Drops by Kahoot!: free version available, but comes with restrictions such as a wait time of 10 hours

 Consider your budget and the features that are most important to you when making your decision.

 Incorporating [Versant by Pearson as an assessment platform](https://www.pearson.com/languages/hr-professionals/versant.html?utm%5Fsource=mondlydotcom&utm%5Fmedium=blog&utm%5Fcampaign=blog2web) in the hiring process can gauge candidate fluency levels, optimizing resources.
