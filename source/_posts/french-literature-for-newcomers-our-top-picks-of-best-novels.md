16. _Le Comte de Monte-Cristo_ (The Count of Monte Cristo) by Alexandre Dumas

 If you’re a**beginner eager to read in French,** it’s best to start with the first book on this list of French novels and then progressively work your way through. This approach ensures that as the texts become more complex, your French reading skills will improve accordingly. As a special highlight, the final recommendations are French classics books that everyone should read in their lifetime.

 Naturally, this list is exclusively dedicated to books originally written in French, because reading them in the original language ensures you experience the full depth and nuances, which can sometimes be lost in translation. However, if we’re talking about a very good translation, you can definitely also**read French translations of foreign books.** For instance, after you’ve tackled the first six books on our list, I highly recommend **reading_Harry Potter_ in French.** Targeted at young readers, the initial books in the series are perfectly suited for beginners.

## How to Choose the Best French Books for New Learners

**The best French novels for new learners** are ones you’ve already read. No, really. Take it from me—a language learner at heart. I perfected my English, Spanish, and French by reading books, and I strongly recommend you do the same to improve your French.

**Reading in French,** if your French is not that good,**can be challenging** at first. That’s why I always suggest starting with a book you have already read in your native language. It could be your favorite book or simply one you want to experience again. Being familiar with the story can significantly ease your first foray into reading a book in French.

 As you progress through the pages, you’ll notice a gradual increase in your familiarity with French. You’ll start to deduce the meanings of unknown words from the context and [learn French](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) in a natural way. Even better, if you read an**eBook in French** on a Kindle, you can leverage the dictionary feature to learn new words simply by tapping on them.

 After finishing, you can move on to a book you’ve never read before—in any language. However, depending on your French level, I’d suggest opting for a French novel for beginners, like_Le Petit Prince_ (The Little Prince), which is technically a novella.

 Let’s recap.**This is how to start reading in French:**

1. Read your favorite book first (or just a book you read before) as it will help you get used to reading in French;
2. Continue with a short and accessible book that uses simpler language – like _Le Petit Prince_ (The Little Prince);
3. Repeat the first two steps with different books if reading in French doesn’t feel like home yet;
4. Go on with more complex books, but don’t jump straight to French philosophy! Easy does it.

**The secret to choosing the best books to read in French** is to proceed step by step. Begin with shorter, simpler books that use straightforward language, and gradually progress to longer and more complex French books. Throughout this journey, avoid putting pressure on yourself. Reading should be enjoyable, especially when you pick genres that you love. So, make the most of your French reading experience — it will significantly benefit your French studies!

## Top French Authors You Should Know

* Victor Hugo
* Alexandre Dumas
* Jules Verne
* Gustave Flaubert
* George Sand
* Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
* Guy de Maupassant
* Voltaire
* Albert Camus
* Marcel Proust
* Molière
* Jean-Paul Sartre
* Émile Zola
* Stendhal
* Honoré de Balzac

 The history of French literature is rich and extensive. Some of the**world’s most celebrated authors are French,** and you can discover them in this list of top French authors that everyone should know. However, if you want to learn to read French, it’s important to approach it step by step. If you’re just starting out, avoid diving straight into the complex works of Émile Zola or Jean-Paul Sartre. Instead, start with more accessible authors like Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and Victor Hugo. You might not be ready to tackle the**greatest French novels** from day one, but with enough work and patience, you’ll eventually get there.

## Romance French Novels for Incurable Romantics

* _L’amant_ (The Lover) by Marguerite Duras
* _La Dame aux Camélias_ (The Lady of the Camellias) by Alexandre Dumas fils
* _Les Liaisons dangereuses_ (Dangerous Liaisons) by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos
* _Chéri_  by Colette
* _Bonjour Tristesse_ (Hello Sadness) by Françoise Sagan

* _Un long dimanche de fiançailles_ (A very long engagement) by Sebastien Japrisot
* _Suite française_ by Irène Némorovsky
* _Le Grandes Meaulnes_  by Alain-Fournier

 My number one rule for reading in French as a beginner is simple: read what you love. If that means diving into**French romance novels,** then embrace it! When you’re starting to read in French, there’s no such thing as a ‘bad’ book genre.

 Think about the types of books you enjoy in your native language. If history books aren’t your thing in English, chances are you won’t suddenly find a passion for them in French.

 Let’s be honest—everyone enjoys a captivating romance novel now and then. The fact that it’s in French only adds to the charm, making it a delightful bonus on your journey to learning French!
