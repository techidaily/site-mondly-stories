 You don‚Äôt really know a language until you‚Äôve learned its [slang](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) . And when it comes to English, many people agree that Australian slang is the richest, liveliest and funniest slang you could learn. Sure, there‚Äôs always British English, but the Brits don‚Äôt call their barbecue ‚Äúbarbie‚Äù. And that‚Äôs a missed opportunity. Wouldn‚Äôt you agree? How can you have just a plain, dull barbecue when you could have a ‚Äúbarbie‚Äù? The Aussie slang is the best slang.



## Top 10 Popular Australian Slang Terms & Words

 Let‚Äôs start with the basics: core Australian slang vocabulary. Here‚Äôs a list of popular Australian slang terms you probably heard before but didn‚Äôt know what they meant.

### 1._Ta_ ‚Äì Thank you

 You can also use ‚Äúthanks heaps‚Äù when you are really grateful to someone for doing something for you or ‚Äúcheers‚Äù to combine both ‚Äúthank you‚Äù‚Äå and ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù ‚Äåin a single word. For example, ‚Äúcheers‚Äù is a perfect choice for leaving the shop after the barista gives you your coffee.

Well, I don‚Äôt mind if you call me a ‚Äúbarbie girl‚Äù now.

### 4._Crikey!_ ‚Äì An Exclamation of Surprise

 Famously used by Steve Irwin. It‚Äôs similar to the [British English slang](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) ‚Äúblimey!‚Äù.

 There‚Äôs no better replacement for the word ‚Äúmouth‚Äù. Why isn‚Äôt everybody using this?

It can also refer to a small, aggressive dog like a chihuahua.

### 7._Bogan_ ‚Äì An Uncultured or Unsophisticated Person

### 8._Bush Telly_ ‚Äì What You Watch at Night When You Are Camping

 You heard ‚Äútelly‚Äù before, but ‚Äúbush telly‚Äù? That‚Äôs a new one. Basically, when you are camping, you can‚Äôt watch traditional television, so you watch the ‚Äúbush telly‚Äù: the campfire, the stars or just‚Ä¶ the bush.

### 9._Bikkie_ ‚Äì Biscuit

You‚Äôll ask for a ‚Äúbikkie‚Äù just to hear yourself say it.

 There‚Äôs also the very cute expression ‚Äúto cost big bikkies‚Äù, meaning that something is very expensive.

 Aussie slang

## Funny Australian Slang Phrases

 If it weren‚Äôt for this list, you‚Äôd need an Australian slang translator when you hear these Australian slang phrases! Use them in your day-to-day conversations and Aussies might think you‚Äôre one of their own.

### 1\. What‚Äôs the John Dory?

**What‚Äôs going on?**

 John Dory is an edible fish found on the coasts of Africa, Southeast Asia, New Zealand, and ‚Äì of course ‚Äì Australia. There‚Äôs no secret story to it apart from the fact that it just rhymes with ‚Äòstory‚Äô. So, instead of asking,_‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the story?‚Äù_ , in Australian slang, you ask_‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the John Dory?‚Äù_ .

### 2\. Chuck a sickie

**Call in sick without actually being sick.**

 If you ever took a day off work pretending to be sick, you‚Äôre guilty of chucking a sickie._‚ÄúI‚Äôm chucking a sickie to go to the beach. Wanna join?‚Äù_

### 3\. Fair dinkum

**Honest, true or genuine.**

 Popular Australian exclamation often used to emphasize or seek confirmation (if used with the proper intonation) of the genuineness or truth of something._‚ÄúThis pork barbie is fair dinkum!‚Äù_

### 4\. Wrap your laughing gear ‚Äòround that

**Eat that.**

 What‚Äôs your laughing gear? Your mouth, of course. So, when you wrap your laughing gear ‚Äòround something, you‚Ä¶ eat it. It can be used in either a friendly or threatening way.

### 5\. Carrying on like a pork chop

**To behave foolishly.**

Let me get my Australian slang translator for this one. üòÖ

It seems that this phrase has had a lot of variations:

* Carrying on like a pork chop in Jerusalem on a Saturday.
* Carrying on like a pork chop at a Jewish wedding.
* Carrying on like a pork chop in a synagogue.

 While the original message referred to an object that is out of place, the modern meaning has slightly shifted. So, when you hear someone using this Australian slang phrase, know that they are referring to someone who behaves foolishly, makes a fuss, complains, or rants.

### 6\. Dog‚Äôs breakfast

**Complete chaos, mess.**

 You can think of it this way: what does a dog‚Äôs breakfast consist of? Leftovers. Chicken bones or maybe a half-eaten pizza from last night. So, if something is really messy or disordered, then it looks like a dog‚Äôs breakfast.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 7\. Do the Harry

**Disappear.**

 The complete phrase is known as ‚Äúto do a Harold Holt‚Äù, which is rhyming slang for ‚Äúbolt‚Äù. The story behind this Australian slang phrase is related to Harold Holt, the 17th prime minister of Australia. In 1967, Mr. Holt disappeared, presumably by drowning, while swimming along Victoria‚Äôs coast.

Some say he ‚Äúdid the bolt‚Äù from his responsibilities as a prime minister.

### 8\. No worries, mate, she‚Äôll be apples

**Everything will be fine.**

 Also known as ‚Äúshe‚Äôll be right‚Äù, these positive expressions reflect the Australian way of looking at unfortunate events. There‚Äôs no point in worrying about anything, as it will all be alright in the end.
