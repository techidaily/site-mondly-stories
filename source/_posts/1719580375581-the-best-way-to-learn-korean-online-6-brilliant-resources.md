## The Best Way To Learn Korean Online - 6 Brilliant Resources

 **The Korean language is the 13th [most spoken language](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) in the world** today with roughly 77.2 million native speakers in North Korea, South Korea, China and some areas from Japan and Russia. According to the Foreign Service Institute of the US Government, a native English speaker would need around 2200 hours or 88 weeks of study to reach fluency in Korean. Now that may seem like a lot, but there are ways to make learning enjoyable.**Let’s see what is the best way to learn Korean online!**

## 1\. Learn Korean words daily with Mondly

 Until a few years ago, learning a new language was never easy. Especially when it came to languages such as Korean – languages that are not exactly the easiest to learn by a native English speaker.

 But with the rise of language learning apps such as [Mondly](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-3598&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-3598?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=ko&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-3598?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=ko) , everything has changed. **Now you can learn Korean online in just 5 or 10 minutes a day and fit more valuable information in one week with Mondly than in one semester of Korean classes with a teacher.** And you know what? You can get a [**LIFETIME** Mondly Premium membership](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-3598&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-3598?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=ko&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-3598?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=ko) at the bargain price of**ONE CLASS** with a Korean teacher.

 Imagine trying to master Korean pronunciation as an English speaker. If you don’t actively live in South Korea, it can be really tricky to master Korean. And choosing the right curriculum… That’s another headache altogether! But with Mondly, the award-winning language learning app, you can become conversational in no time if you practice Korean daily.

 Featuring bite-sized Daily Lessons, practical topics and authentic Korean conversations recorded by fluent voice artists so you can tackle day-to-day situations, Mondly is the main and the best way to learn Korean online.

[Download the app](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-3598&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-3598?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=ko&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-3598?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=ko) , start practicing daily for 5-10 minutes a day and soon enough you’ll find yourself speaking Korean like you never knew you could. How so? Well, Mondly doesn’t waste your time with unnecessary information that won’t get you conversational. Instead, it focuses on getting you fluent in Korean using the inductive method – learn by doing, context and example, and extrapolate to rules.

 So what are you waiting for?‌ Get Mondly right now and start learning Korean words you’ll actually get to use in your day-to-day conversations in Korean.

## 2\. Watch Korean Movies

 Has it ever happened to you to spend time in a foreign country and then hear people at home speak the language of the country you visited? Strangely enough, your brain is so smart it just accommodates to the sounds you hear. It creates expectations and when these expectations are not met, it “recalibrates” to hear the right sounds. The process happens so fast that some of the times you won’t realize, but it’s always there.

 So why not use the brilliance of your brain into your own advantage? **Why not create a medium where you can hear Korean on a daily or at least weekly basis?** For example, you could watch Korean movies**.** Given the fact that South Korea isn’t short of amazing movies, you’ll surely have a great time getting your brain used to the Korean language. In fact, some of the best movies ever made were Korean.[“Oldboy”](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/) ,[“Memories of Murder”](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0353969/?ref%5F=nv%5Fsr%5F1?ref%5F=nv%5Fsr%5F1) ,[“New World”](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2625030/?ref%5F=nv%5Fsr%5F4?ref%5F=nv%5Fsr%5F4) or [“Parasite”](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/?ref%5F=nv%5Fsr%5F1?ref%5F=nv%5Fsr%5F1) are just a few of them.

## 3\. Learn Hangul, the Korean alphabet

 Following the logic of learning to write in your native tongue, learning [Hangul, the Korean alphabet](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) will give you a head start if you want to learn Korean.

 In fact, whenever you want to learn a language that uses a different writing system than your native language, you should definitely explore its alphabet first. This way, the learning process will make more sense and it will become easier.

## 4\. Explore a Korean dictionary

 Learning Korean should be considered a personal triumph. Throughout your study, don’t ever forget that. The whole process is indeed more time-consuming than learning a [romance language](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) (for example), but it’s not impossible. Depending on your objective – to learn enough Korean to talk to other people during your trip to South Korea or to master it to perfection because you want to work there – you can adapt the amount of work you’ll need to do in order to reach the corresponding level of Korean you’ll need.

 The bottom line is that you can learn Korean online, at home, without paying someone thousands of dollars to help you. Mondly and a Korean dictionary such as [Naver](https://endic.naver.com/search.nhn?sLn=en&isOnlyViewEE=N&query=learn) are everything you need to learn Korean online without a teacher.

 Always keep a Korean dictionary at hand – not necessarily Naver, but whichever you like – and search for relevant words throughout the day: “chair”, “office”, “colleagues”, “street”, “coffee” and so on. Maybe you won’t remember it the first time, but you know what they say: third time’s a charm!

## 5\. Use flashcards for those Korean words that won’t stick

 We all have some stubborn words that just won’t stick. They don’t necessarily need to be in a foreign language. Sometimes we get this kind of “slip of the tongue” moment even in our native tongues.

 Luckily, flashcards can help a great deal in this situation. Identify these “stubborn” Korean words, write them on sticky notes – so they’ll stick both literally and figuratively – and put them by the bed, in the bathroom, in the kitchen or wherever you spend the most time during a day. Next thing you know, the very same words that didn’t seem to stick, will now follow you everywhere.

## 6\. The best way to learn Korean: explore Hallyu

 It’s no secret that falling in love with a culture can give you the power to move mountains and learn its language faster than anyone else. Nothing drives you like passion. And if you want to learn Korean, you’ll need a lot of passion.

 Luckily, the Korean culture is one of the most fascinating cultures in the world. Especially if you never explored Asia before, the Korean culture will charm you completely.

 **As a matter of fact, the Korean culture is so influential that has gained its own name: Hallyu (“The Korean Wave”).** [Hallyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean%5FWave) is in fact a Chinese term used to refer to the incredible growth of the Korean culture. This includes everything from music, movies, drama, Korean cuisine to online games.

 Just look into it, discover the magic of Hallyu and soon enough you’ll love every minute of your Korean lessons with Mondly.

 And… that was it! Now you know what is the best way to learn Korean online.
