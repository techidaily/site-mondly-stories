_Good morning_ is – along with [_hello_](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) – one of the most common travel words around the world. Nothing breaks the cultural ice like a respectful greeting in the local language. This is why the ability to say good morning in different languages is a life skill that is well worth learning. Let’s dive in!

## 1\. Good morning in Spanish:_¡Buenos días!_

**_Buenos días_ literally means “good days”, but it is used to say “good morning” in Spanish.** Suitable for all social contexts, this greeting can be used with both friends and strangers. If you want to mix things up, you can also add_hola_ and say “hola, buenos días” as it is a very standard and friendly salutation. If you want to say goodbye in the morning, you can say “adiós, buenos días” which is a nice way to wish someone a good day.

 It is also important to note that in some countries from South America it’s common to say “buen día” which is literally the singular form of “buenos días”. However, if you go to Spain, it’s best to stick with “buenos días”.

## 2\. Good morning in French:_Bon matin !_

 **Remember this: in European French, there is no exact translation for the phrase “good morning”.** Therefore, in France, you should always use [“bonjour”](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) instead of “bon matin” if you want to “good morning” in French.

 On the other hand, in Quebec, “bon matin” is the preferred greeting usually until around 10 or 11 a.m.

 Both “bonjour” and “bon matin” are appropriate in both formal and informal settings and can be used with friends and strangers alike.
