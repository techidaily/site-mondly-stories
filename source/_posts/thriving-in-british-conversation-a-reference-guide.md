 American English vs. British English

 British phrases and expressions are extraordinarily interesting to those who aren’t familiar with their terms. The common British words we see already seem so fancy and sometimes even whimsical and learning them will surely give you a leg up next time you start writing your [5 paragraph essay](https://edubirdie.com/blog/five-paragraph-essay) , or have a chinwag with your British mates!

## Differences Between American and British English

 As mentioned before, British terms, British phrases, British expressions as well as spelling differ by American phrases and expressions, but what else is there? When we think about [British versus American English](https://preply.com/en/blog/british-english-vs-american-english-slang-compared/) , we think about slang terms and pronunciation.

 It’s also fun to learn just how different British sayings are. Some very noticeable differences between the two English languages are:

* **Vocabulary** – While the two may share the majority of words in the English language, there are also some differences. For example,_apartment_ in US English is the same as_flat_ in British English.
* **Spelling** – For example, the word_color_ . While Americans don’t spell it with an “ou”, British English has words such as_colour_ and_honour._
* **Past Tense Verbs** – The British tend to “-t” instead of –ed. Such examples are_learned_ and_learnt_ ,_dreamed_ and_dreamt_ .

 Having learned some of the most common British words and phrases, let’s move on to some frequently asked questions.

### Why do the British say ‘cheers’?

 ‘Cheers’ is an informal manner of expressing gratitude, akin to saying ‘thank you’. When combined with the word ‘mate’, it forms the phrase “Cheers, mate”, which carries the same meaning as “Thank you, my friend.”

### Can you be British but not English?

 People who are English are from the country of England. On the other hand, British people are people who live in Great Britain (Britain) and the UK. Consequently, being English implies a distinction from being Scottish, Welsh, or Northern Irish. In contrast, the term British encompasses anyone originating from Great Britain. This means that everyone residing in Scotland, Wales, or England is collectively identified as British.

### How to speak like a British?

 To speak like a British person, it’s essential to prioritize your pronunciation and vocabulary. Keep in mind that British accents exhibit significant regional variations, so actively listening to native speakers can aid in emulating specific accents like the esteemed ‘Received Pronunciation’. Additionally, acquaint yourself with British slang and remain cognizant of grammatical disparities. Finally, it is crucial to approach the emulation of a British accent with the utmost respect and a sincere curiosity about British culture. Doing this will help you improve your British accent faster.

### Will British and American English diverge?

 In a different era with little to no way of communicating, it would be entirely possible for British English and American English to diverge. However, modern times allow the two to communicate without restrictions. As time goes by, there’s a chance for more differences to emerge, but it’s unlikely that British and American English diverge completely.
