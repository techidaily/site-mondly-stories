## Mondly’s Boundless Learning Network: A Community of 70+ Million

 **We are proud to announce that [Mondly](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5757&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5757&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5757) has surpassed 70 million learners following months of record-high growth with many exciting launches and achievements.**

 In a year like none other, language learning apps have become more popular than ever. People everywhere turned quarantine to their own advantage and learned new skills with the help of apps while being stuck inside. As language learners ourselves, we can’t help but applaud their accomplishments. Thanks to their commitment and our determination to offer people everywhere access to high-quality education on their mobile phones, Mondly too has grown.

 **Our Facebook page has over 1 million likes and our worldwide community of learners is now over 70 million strong.** We are grateful to be able to improve the lives of so many people every day and we’re humbled by all the appreciation we’re receiving. At Mondly, we put the customer at the center of everything that we do and we’re thrilled that all of you loved the amazing updates we recently brought to Mondly.

## Hands-Free, the new way of learning languages on the go

[Mondly Hands-Free](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) , our newest addition to Mondly, became available for iOS learners at the beginning of 2021 and people already love it.

 **Hours of hands-free**
 With the new hands-free update, I am spending hours on Mondly each day, and I’m able to stay active while doing it. My language learning is skyrocketing. Thank you!5-star review on the App Store

 Hands-Free is an all-new learning assistant that will help unlock your speaking skills on the go. Whether you are working out, doing chores around the house or simply relaxing at the end of the day, Hands-Free allows you to simultaneously [learn a new language](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) .

 Designed for busy bees, tech aficionados or merely language enthusiasts, the breakthrough feature empowers learners to reach their language goals hands-free – and hassle-free.

 The amount of positive feedback we are getting for Hands-Free is astonishing. People everywhere are praising the voice-powered upgrade for its ability to make the process feel less like studying and more like talking to an old friend. That is why we are working harder than ever to make it available for Android learners too as soon as possible.

## English progress tests created in partnership with Oxford University Press

 In 2020, many of us learned that every cloud has a silver lining. At Mondly, we are committed to offering learners everywhere access to high-quality language courses on their mobile phones. This is why we tried – and hopefully succeeded – to make 2020 brighter for the 1.5 billion people worldwide currently learning English.

 How? By joining forces with Oxford University Press and introducing an enhanced [English language learning module](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) supporting 33 languages.

[oxford english test](https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/oxford-english-test-960x504.png "Mondly Surpasses 70 Million Learners Worldwide 2") ](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875)

 The new custom English progress tests from Mondly and Oxford University Press

 Our top linguists organized the content that Oxford University Press provided and crafted a new suite of 108 English progress tests with more than 3500 distinct questions. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned learner, the new testing module will adapt its level to match your skills.

 For many of those 1.5 billion people, learning English is not just a hobby, but the key to success. Therefore, it was essential for us to maximize the outcome of our partnership and make the trusted content from Oxford available in 33 native languages – including yours.

## Mondly is now available on Huawei AppGallery too

 When it comes to our apps, accessibility is key. We want everyone to be able to learn new languages with Mondly, regardless of the device or platform they choose. Naturally, with the AppGallery in the top three app stores globally, we were thrilled when Huawei proposed to us to bring Mondly to their community too.

 In the process of making Mondly ready for Huawei’s AppGallery, we made sure to bring the same seamless and fun experience to all those of you who use the AppGallery to download your favorite apps. Mondly is now available anytime, anywhere and we can’t wait for you to make the most of it.

 Following its [debut on the AppGallery](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) , Mondly was highlighted as a success story many times over – including during [Huawei’s Developer Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=%5FRZNZ4JDdPU) last November.

 Huawei Developer Webinar – Grow with AppGallery in China

## Loved by learners, supported by experts

 Our mission at Mondly has always been to help people speak new languages fast through technological innovation. This is why we always drew inspiration from tech pioneers such as Google or Apple. Now, seeing all the incredible feedback coming from the very experts who inspired us, we couldn’t be prouder by what we have achieved so far.

 Following our series of exciting updates, Mondly has been featured multiple times in both Apple’s App Store and Huawei’s AppGallery.

### “App of the Day” in Apple’s App Store in 157 countries

 “Create Good Resolutions Now”, “Apps We Love Right Now” and “Learn a New Language” are only a few of the categories Mondly has been featured in the last few months. But the greatest honor of all was to be named [“App of the Day”](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) in 157 countries and to be featured on Apple’s celebratory story with the occasion of Romania’s National Day.

 We are thrilled to have received the spotlight in so many countries, but the dearest to our heart was surely the story on the most trending Romanian apps. As Romanians ourselves, it was an honor to be able to represent the thriving tech scene in Romania alongside fellow tech innovators.

### Named among the Best Apps of 2020 by Huawei in the “Best for Personal Growth” category

 Last but not least, another round of good news came from China. After just months of being launched on Huawei AppGallery, Mondly was featured in “New Apps We Love” and named among the Best Apps of 2020 in the “Best for Personal Growth” category. We’re happy to see how much the new community of learners loves Mondly!

 We deeply admire everything Apple and Huawei do and hope to make it to their “Walk of Fame” many times over in the future.

## What’s next?

 We don’t know what the future holds in terms of quarantine, social distancing, or remote working and learning, but whatever the context, we pledge ourselves to never stop innovating. We will continue doing the work that will enrich people’s lives for years to come.

Here’s to 70 million learners and counting! 🥂
