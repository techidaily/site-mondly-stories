## Discover the Best Cross-Cultural Film Experiences

 The holiday season is upon us yet again, which means delicious food, fun events with friends and family, and plenty of time to snuggle on the couch binging your favorite movies. If you’re currently in the process of learning a foreign language, it’s also an excellent time to sneak in some practice.

## Learn a Language: How Foreign Movies Can Help

 As an English speaker, you probably have a variety of favorite films come to mind when you think of the holiday season. You might even have a list of favorites that you and your family watch every year as a tradition. They don’t necessarily have to be Christmas movies. Some families like to binge comedies, and others prefer to focus on action or historical films. No matter what your preferences are if your current focus is language learning, you might want to add a few foreign films to your movie list for this year.

### Listen to Native Speakers

 When learning a language, it can be helpful to listen to native speakers. Watching foreign movies is an easy way to do that.

### Learn Through Real-life Situations

 The context of the story provides insights into the language spoken during the film. You’ll be able to see how certain words, phrases, and slang terms are used in various situations.

### Use Visual Cues

 In any film, there will be plenty of visual cues to help provide further details on how certain words are used. Along with paying attention to the overall story, you can also watch for small things, like the way a character refers to the beer in their hand or the way they comment on the weather, to increase your understanding of the language.

### Take Advantage of Subtitles

 When all else fails, the subtitles are there to help. If you’re getting good at the language, you might want to try watching the film without the subtitles. However, there is no shame in using them either. They’re a good way to measure how far along you are in the learning process.
