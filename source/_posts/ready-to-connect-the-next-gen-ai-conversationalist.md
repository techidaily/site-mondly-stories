 Imagine yourself, sitting in a restaurant and ordering a meal with confidence, meeting new friends, and being able to strike up a conversation. Jumping in a cab and knowing you will turn up at the right place or booking yourself into a hotel.

 Research shows that practice really does make perfect, but practising is not always easy:

* You can at times feel shy, foolish, or imperfect. Worried that you might be judged.
* Scheduling a professional tutor into your busy life can be difficult and expensive.
* The alternative of writing to a chatbot can feel impersonal and not reflect real life.

 Mondly by Pearson’s new AI conversation partner changes all of this. An innovative new way to take you one step closer to achieving your language goals. Say hello to LUNA.

## Why LUNA?

* LUNA is powered by AI. So she will not judge you, speak over you, try to complete your sentence, or get bored. She will listen, respond, help you understand when you don’t get it 100% right, and she will do that as many times as you need to build your confidence.
* Forget about adjusting your schedule or time zone coordination. LUNA is always available for you, anytime, anywhere. So, no more excuses not to practice!
* In today’s economy affordability is key. Every Mondly by Pearson learner gets access to one free lesson, and you unlock all the available conversations with our premium membership. You can practice saying hello, ordering a meal in a restaurant, booking a hotel, buying tickets, striking up a conversation, shopping for a new pair of jeans, booking an appointment or confidently jumping in a taxi and giving directions to where you want to go.
* Speaking in real life situations is key to building your confidence – Mondly by Pearson’s AI conversation partner simulates real conversations, so it feels less like a tool and more like a tutor.

 **Be among the first to [meet LUNA](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) , your new AI conversation partner and build your confidence in speaking English.**
