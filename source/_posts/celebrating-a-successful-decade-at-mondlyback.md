## Celebrating a Successful Decade at MondlyBack

 **10 years ago today, Mondly was officially launched on the AppStore.**

 From a small startup with a big dream, we have grown into a global language learning platform trusted by millions. During this decade, we began to speak the language of innovation fluently, experienced significant growth, and remained steadfast in our commitment to making language learning fun, easy, and accessible for everyone.

 The journey was incredible, but it wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without our dedicated team, wonderful colleagues at Pearson, and passionate users like you. Your support and enthusiasm have been the driving force behind our success, inspiring us to continuously improve and expand our offerings.

 As we celebrate this significant milestone, we invite you to take a trip down memory lane with us. We‚Äôre excited to share a snapshot of our 10 years of success, highlighting the key moments and achievements that have defined our journey.

 Happy anniversary to everyone learning languages with Mondly! Here‚Äôs to many more years of breaking language barriers together. ü•Ç
