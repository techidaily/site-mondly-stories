## The Cousins' Contrast: Spain’s Spanish Compared to Portugal'e Portuguese

 We all know that languages coming from the same language family generally share similar traits. That’s canonical for most language families. In our case, the Romance languages descend from Vulgar Latin and that is the reason why there are so many words that sound almost the same in all five languages (six – if you count in Latin). For example, the word “water” is “aqua” in Latin, “agua” in Spanish, “água” in Portuguese, “acqua” in Italian, “eau” in French and “apă” in Romanian. Except for French and Romanian, they are all similar. Still, as you were right to think,**Spanish and Portuguese are the most alike.** So yes, Portuguese is similar to Spanish, but how mutually intelligible are they? Let the Spanish vs. Portuguese battle begin!

## Common Misconceptions: Portuguese Is Not Spanish

 This is probably one of the most common language-related misconceptions. No, Portuguese is not Spanish, but they were both born in the Iberian Peninsula somehow isolated from the rest of the land by the Pyrenees. For this reason, it’s only natural for them to resemble in a lot of ways. After all, there’s an almost**90% lexical similarity** between the two, meaning that 90% of their words have a cognate (equivalent) in the other language. So, naturally, if you speak one, you’ll probably understand a part of the second but don’t count on being able to speak it fluently.

 Here are the main characteristics that make Spanish and Portuguese different, but also quite similar:

| Language                  | Spanish                                 | Portuguese                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Native Speakers           | Approximately 480 million               | Approximately 215 million                |
| Official Language in      | 21 countries                            | 10 countries                             |
| Word Order                | Word Order Subject-Verb-Object          | Subject-Object-Verb                      |
| Pronunciation Differences | Distinct "z" and "c" sounds             | Voiceless fricative "s" sound            |
| Variants                  | European Spanish Latin American Spanish | European Portuguese Brazilian Portuguese |
| Mutual Intelligibility    | Written: High, Spoken: Moderate         |                                          |
| Lexical Similarity        | Around 90%                              |                                          |
| Language Family           | Romance                                 |                                          |

## Mutual Intelligibility: Written vs. Spoken Forms

[Spoken Spanish](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) and Portuguese are less mutually intelligible than their written forms. In other words, on paper, the two languages look very similar and speakers of either language can generally read the other language without too much struggle. But when it comes to the spoken forms or the phonology, things get a bit more complicated as the pronunciation is more different than you’d expect. However, it is said that Portuguese speakers typically understand spoken Spanish better than Spanish speakers understand spoken Portuguese. After all, there’s an almost 90% lexical similarity between the two.

 To help you observe the written mutual intelligibility between Spanish and Portuguese better, let’s look at a short basic lesson on verbs in two variations:

### Portuguese to Spanish

### Spanish to Portuguese

 Do you see now why the spoken forms are less mutually intelligible than the written forms?

## Examples of Similarities and Differences Between Spanish and Portuguese

 Let’s look at some examples to help you better understand the similarities and differences between Spanish and Portuguese.

* **English:** “Are there any interesting sights that we can visit?”
* **Spanish:** _¿Hay algún lugar interesante al que debamos ir?_
* **Portuguese:** _Há algum lugar interessante que possamos visitar?_
* **English:** “Where do you recommend I eat?”
* **Spanish:** _¿Dónde me recomiendas que coma?_
* **Portuguese:** _Onde você me recomenda para comer?_
* **English:** “I have booked a room.”
* **Spanish:** _He reservado una habitación._
* **Portuguese:** _Eu reservei um quarto._

 Quite similar, aren’t they? But remember: that does not make them the same language. Words like_información_ (Spanish) and_informação_ (Portuguese) or_carro_ (Spanish) and_carro_ (Portuguese) may look the same, but they sound different. While the Spanish_carro_ is pronounced the same way it is written (with the strong double_r)_ , in the Portuguese_carro,_  the double_rr_ is pronounced using what is known as a voiceless fricative or a guttural_r_ . So “r” is**– only in some cases –** the Portuguese equivalent of the Spanish “j” and are both pronounced using the “h” sound.

## False Friends: Watch Out for These Tricky Words

 Unsurprisingly, **Spanish and Portuguese share a lot of [cognates](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/cognate)**  (words from different languages that look and sound similar and even share the same meaning), but they also share a lot of “false friends” or false cognates (words that look and sound the same and might share a common origin, but have different meanings). So it would be best if you would not get ahead of yourself in trying to guess the meaning of a new word that looks similar to a word you already know. Crazy misunderstandings like being pregnant instead of being embarrassed can happen when you least expect it! _(If you are not familiar with this [cognate](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) \-> the Spanish “embarazada” is similar to the English “embarrassed”, but funnily enough, it translates to “pregnant” in English.) _

 Here are some examples of the**most common “false friends” from Spanish and Portuguese** to help you avoid potentially embarrassing situations:

* **_pelado_** translates to “skinned” or “peeled” in both languages but colloquially changes its meaning to “having a shaved [head or new haircut” in Spanish](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) and “being naked” in Portuguese. You wouldn’t want to mix those two, wouldn’t you?
* while in Spanish,**_largo_** means “long” and_ancho_ means “wide”; in Portuguese,_largo_ means “wide” and_longo_ means “long”. That sounds like a headache, doesn’t it?
* **_polvo_** means “octopus” in Portuguese and “dust” in Spanish
* you already know that the Spanish _(estar)**embarazada**_  means “(to be) pregnant”. Well, the same as English, Portuguese translates _(estar)**embaraçada**_  to “(to be) embarrassed” or “(to be) entangled” so be careful with this one (again!)
* **_exquisita_** means “exquisite” or “delicious” in Spanish and**_esquisita_** (notice the “s” that takes the place of the “x”) means “weird” in Portuguese. A letter can truly change everything…
* “red” is**_rojo_** in Spanish, but Portuguese**_roxo_** breaks the “Romance” norm and translates to “purple”. The Portuguese “red” is_vermelho;_
* **_rato_** means “a little while” in Spanish and “rat” in Portuguese;
* **_traer_** is “bring” in Spanish and the similar-looking **_trair_** is “betray” in Portuguese;
* **_cadera_** means “hip” in Spanish and **_cadeira_** (notice the extra ‘i’) means “chair” in Portuguese;
* **_pegar_** means “to hit” in Spanish and “to pick up” in Portuguese;
* **_Perú_** refers to the country in Spanish, but in Portuguese, if you drop the accent **_(peru)_** , it means “turkey”;
* **_borracha_** refers to a drunk girl in Spanish, but to a “rubber” or “eraser” in Portuguese;
* **_salada_** does mean “salad” in Portuguese, but in Spanish it means “salty”;
* **_oso_** means “bear” in Spanish and **_osso_**  (with an extra ‘s’) is “bone” in Portuguese;
* **_acordar_**  means “to agree” in Spanish and “to wake up” in Portuguese.

## Spanish-Portuguese cognates

 Cognates are words that have a common etymological origin. Essentially, they are “linguistic cousins”. They often**look similar and have the same or similar meanings.** Since Portuguese and Spanish share nearly 90% of their vocabulary, there are a lot of such cognates between them. Here are a few examples:

 Spanish-Portuguese Cognates

| English   | Spanish  | Portuguese |
| --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| water     | agua     | água       |
| food      | comida   | comida     |
| house     | casa     | casa       |
| life      | vida     | vida       |
| table     | mesa     | mesa       |
| eyes      | ojos     | olhos      |
| happy     | contento | contente   |
| sleep     | dormir   | dormir     |
| attention | atención | atenção    |
| city      | ciudad   | cidade     |
| to love   | amar     | amar       |
| to know   | saber    | saber      |
| to be     | ser      | ser        |
| to open   | abrir    | abrir      |
| easy      | fácil    | fácil      |
| book      | libro    | livro      |
| flower    | flor     | flor       |
| family    | familia  | família    |
| together  | juntos   | junto      |

## Other Notable Differences

 At this point, we already settled that although very similar, Portuguese and Spanish are also different in terms of pronunciation and false cognates. Besides, there are also differences given by the area in which the language is spoken.[Brazilian Portuguese is different from European Portuguese](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) and Latin American Spanish is different from European Spanish. And as we already mentioned, behind that, there are entire centuries of rich history and different influences. It’s nothing but fascinating!

 But before you go, here are four more major differences between the two languages we should not overlook:

* while in Spanish both_yo_ and_me_ are used to express the singular form of the first person “I”, in Portuguese only_eu_ is used;
* _ñ_ in the Spanish alphabet becomes_nh_ in Portuguese, so España or Spain is Espanha in Portuguese;
* while in Spanish you have to use_muy_ before adverbs and adjectives and_mucho_ before a noun or after a verb, in Portuguese you just use_muito_ ;
* while Portuguese speakers tend to use_a casa dela_ to express possession, the Spanish speakers just say_su casa_ as you probably already know from the well-known expression_Mi casa es su casa_ ;

### What are the key pronunciation differences between Spanish and Portuguese?

 Portuguese, sometimes likened to Russian in its sounds, is a stress-timed language with varied vowel sounds and atonic syllable reduction. In contrast, Spanish, characterized by its smooth and consistent pronunciation, is syllable-timed, providing a rhythmic flow where each syllable takes roughly the same amount of time. Additionally, Portuguese features numerous slurred sounds, contributing to its fluid nature, while Spanish, in contrast, has more pronounced and distinct word articulation.

### Is it easier to learn Spanish if you already know Portuguese, and vice versa?

 Considering there’s almost a 90% lexical similarity between Spanish and Portuguese, yes. It’s definitely easier to learn Spanish if you already know Portuguese and the other way around.
