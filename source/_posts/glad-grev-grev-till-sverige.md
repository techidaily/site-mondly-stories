## What you should know

 Swedes are respectful, but they rarely use last names or Mr. and Mrs in rather formal conversations as well. They like to call themselves by their first name, even in some professional circles. Equality and the lack of hierarchies in the workplace is a specific trait of the Swedish society. If you want to move to Sweden or visit the country, you must get accustomed to all these little details. This will make it easier for you to become “one of them” and meet new people

 If you’re visiting and want to get a coffee, the simplest way to sound and look like a local is to throw in a smile and a **“Hej!”** (pronounced just like _Hey!_). This one is the perfect greeting, regardless of the time of day or to whom you address it.

## How to say “Hello!” in Swedish

 In more formal circumstances, you can use the word **“hallå”** (/haˈloː/). Sometimes, Swedes like to articulate the word when greeting someone by saying **“** **Hallå, hallå!”**  or even use it when they’re irritated and what to bring more attention to a situation they’re telling you about.

## How to answer the phone in Swedish

 Even if you’re just visiting, you might have to answer the phone at the hotel or when you’re expecting a call from the embassy, for example. The easiest way to do this is to say “Hello” followed by introducing yourself. This sounds something like : **“** **Hallå! Det här är \[your name\].”**  This will not only impress the person on the other end, but they might mistake you for a local. That would be a good thing, but you need to let them know you don’t speak Swedish fluently before they start talking faster.

## How to say “Good Morning!” in Swedish

 At the restaurant, cafés, or when you enter a building, saying “Good Morning!” is a sign of respect and will help you establish a connection with those around you.
