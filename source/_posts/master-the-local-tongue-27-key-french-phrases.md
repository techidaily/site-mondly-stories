## Master the Local Tongue: 27 Key French Phrases

 A French accent is not everything. Sure, the correct [pronunciation of the notorious French “r”](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) can make you sound more like a native. But what use is that if you can’t actually [speak French](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) fluently? This is why you should always work on expanding your vocabulary with practical notions such as [French phrases and expressions](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) . These can add substance and even humor to your discourse and can make you sound like you have been living in France your whole life. Add a bit of_joie de vivre_ to that and people will think you were born and raised in Paris.

 Additionally, French sayings will provide insight into French history and culture and they will also make you sound more natural, more authentic. After all, this is your main goal when [learning French](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5378&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5378?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=fr&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5378?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=fr) , isn’t it? So let’s dive in and see what French sayings, expressions, and idioms you can use to sound as if you were French-born.

## General French sayings

 So what is a French saying? A saying is a short, pithy, and commonly known expression that offers wisdom or a piece of advice. You probably heard the English expression “the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree” meaning that a child has similar qualities to his parents. Well, this is the perfect example of what we could call a saying.

 And French, like any other language, is full of such witty insights. Let’s look at some of the most common them.

### _1\. Battre le fer pendant qu’il est chaud._

**Literal translation:** “Strike the iron while it is hot.”

**Actual meaning:** Since we have the same saying in English, this one’s easy. When the blacksmith is forging the iron, the metal must be red-hot so its shape can be changed. This means you have to take advantage of favorable situations.

**How to use it**

 – _J’ai trouvé une très bonne application pour pratiquer mon français. Ça s’appelle Mondly et son prix pour une année est très raisonable._ (“I found a very good app to practice my French. It’s called Mondly and its price for one year is very good.”)

 – _Qu’est-ce que tu attends ? Il faut battre le fer pendant qu’il est chaud !_ (“What are you waiting for? Strike the iron while it’s hot!”)

### _2\. Ce n’est pas la mer à boire._

**Literal translation:** “It’s not as if you have to drink the sea.”

**Actual meaning:** “It’s not that difficult” or “it’s not a big deal”. You can use it when someone complains about doing something.

**How to use it**

 –_Je dois faire quatre rapports cette semaine._ (“I have to do four reports this week.”)

 –_Oh là là, ce n’est pas la mer à boire !_ (“Come on, it’s not the end of the world!”)

### _3\. La nuit porte conseil._

**Literal translation:** “The night brings advice.”

**Actual meaning:** This is the equivalent of “sleep on it”. Or, in other words, take your time before making a decision.

**How to use it**

_– Je ne sais pas si je dois accepter ou pas._ (“I don’t know if I should accept or not.”)

 –_La nuit porte conseil._ (“Sleep on it.”)

### _4\. Comme on fait son lit, on se couche._

**Literal translation:** “You’ve made your bed, now lie on it.”

**Actual meaning:**

 There’s a very funny [Italian expression](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) that says_Hai voluto la bicicletta? E adesso pedala!_ (“Did you want the bicycle? Now ride it.”) and it has the exact same meaning as_Comme on fait son lit, on se couche_ . Isn’t fascinating how different cultures approach a similar situation?

 The same as the biblical version “you reap what you sow”, this French saying warns that you suffer the consequences of your actions or that you must accept the unpleasant results of something you’ve done. On the other hand, the opposite is also possible! Make a nice bed and you shall sleep soundly.

**How to use it**

 –_Je me suis endormi et j’ai brûlé les côtelettes de porc._ (“I fell asleep and burned the pork chops.”)

 –_Comme on fait son lit, on se couche._ (“You’ve made your bed, now lie on it.”)

### _6\. Impossible n’est pas français._

**Literal translation:** “Impossible isn’t French.”

**Actual meaning:** Famously attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte,_impossible n’est pas français_ is the French equivalent of “nothing is impossible”. While it may seem very patriotic,_français_ here doesn’t refer to the French people, but rather to the French language. As in “impossible is not a [French word](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) ”.

**Literal translation:** “The outfit doesn’t make the monk.”

**Actual meaning:** “Don’t judge a book by its cover” or “don’t judge a person by their appearance”. This saying is also very popular in English so you probably already know in what contexts you can safely include it. Just don’t forget that you can use it for both positive and negative comments.
