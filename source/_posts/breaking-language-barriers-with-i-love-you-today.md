## Breaking Language Barriers with 'I Love You' Today

 When it comes to expressing our love and affection, there’s nothing quite as powerful as those three little words: “I love you”. But did you know that saying “I love you” in different languages can add an extra layer of meaning and beauty to your message? From French’s_Je t’aime_ to Spanish’s_Te quiero_ and to Japanese’s_Aishiteru,_ the way we express love varies greatly across cultures and languages. Each version has its own unique charm and significance.

* In Arabic, “I love you” is “ana behibak” (أنا بحبك).
* In Chinese, “I love you” is “wǒ ài nǐ” (我爱你).
* In Dutch, “I love you” is “ik hou van je” (Ik hou van je).
* In French, “I love you” is “je t’aime” (Je t’aime).
* In German, “I love you” is “ich liebe dich” (Ich liebe dich).
* In Greek, “I love you” is “s’agapo” (σ’αγαπώ).
* In Hindi, “I love you” is “main tumse pyar karta hoon” (मैं तुमसे प्यार करता हूँ).
* In Italian, “I love you” is “ti amo” (Ti amo).
* In Japanese, “I love you” is “aishiteru” (愛してる).
* In Korean, “I love you” is “saranghae” (사랑해).
* In Portuguese, “I love you” is “eu te amo” (Eu te amo).
* In Russian, “I love you” is “ya tebya lyublyu” (Я тебя люблю).
* In Spanish, “I love you” is “te quiero” (Te quiero).
* In Swedish, “I love you” is “jag älskar dig” (Jag älskar dig).
* In Turkish, “I love you” is “seni seviyorum” (Seni seviyorum).
* In Ukrainian, “I love you” is “ya tebe kokhayu” (Я тебе кохаю).

Here are some more ways to say “I love you” in other languages:

* Afrikaans:_Ek het jou lief!_
* Albanian:_Te dua!_
* Bengali:_Aami tomake bhalo bashi! (আমি তোমাকে ভালবাসি।)_
* Czech:_Miluji te!_
* Danish:_Jeg elsker dig!_
* Estonian:_Ma armastan sind!_
* Finnish:_Rakastan sinua!_
* Hungarian:_Szeretlek!_
* Icelandic:_Eg elska þig!_
* Indonesian:_Saya cinta kamu!_
* Irish:_Tá grá agam duit!_
* Latvian:_Es tevi mīlu!_
* Lithuanian:_Aš tave myliu!_
* Norwegian:_Jeg elsker deg!_

 Love is such a magical and refreshing feeling. No wonder it makes us smile so broadly. Although it makes us do crazy things, it still remains the purest of feelings. Under its spell, we become brave enough to show our true selves and crazy enough to scream, at the top of our lungs, in the middle of Times Square: I LOVE YOU! But sometimes we feel that even that wouldn’t be enough, so we look for new ways to say “I love you”. And when it comes to romance,[French – being the language of love](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) – is the first thing that pops into our minds. It has a peerless romantic elegance that is simply contagious. “I love you” in French –_Je t’aime_ – sounds like it could melt any heart!

 Is this still not enough? Here’s how saying “I love you” different languages can be fun:

## How to say I love you – a quick guide for “I love you”s in 30 most common languages

 Modern society makes us feel so much and express so little! We’ve become shallow. Just like [the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo%5FefYhYU2A) says, many of us aren’t probably happy in this modern world. We bury ourselves every day under mountains of unexpressed feelings often because of social media. We’re afraid to show our inner, deeper selves. We put on masks. We don’t dare to be romantic anymore. And still, our loved ones are the ones that get to discover more of ourselves. More than just a pretty face and a cool Instagram account. That’s because they drown us in authentic, real love. They see the best in us and stick around even the hardest times. And they deserve the same back. Always. Not just on Valentine’s Day. But every single day! Wine for him, flowers for her, little gifts for the both of them. Today. This is a reminder.

 Now back to expressing your love in different languages. If you feel like the video above wasn’t enough for you, here’s how to write “I love you” in different languages – with transliterations where it’s needed. **Keep in mind that these aren’t always the most commonly used in their home country.** They are, instead, the most complete and grammatically correct – which is what you really need in the beginning.

 P.S.: If you are getting too excited to find out how do you say [I love you in Spanish](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) , here’s the quick answer:_te amo!_
 While there’s a second form –_te quiero_ – that is used more for family and friends, “te amo” is more romantic and has a deeper meaning of love. So if you want to say that to your lover, you should definitely use “te amo”.

## The perfect Valentine’s Day gift: 365 gifts for 365 days

 Now that you know how to say “I love you” in so many languages, here’s a sweet present idea you could use for your next anniversary or Valentine’s Day. All you need to buy is a big jar – big enough for all your love. The rest of it comes from the bottom of your heart. The first step is to prepare 365 pieces of paper of different colors and sizes and write “I love you” in different languages on the first 32 of them. Go wildly romantic with the rest of them: you could write love quotes for him or love quotes for her, poems or songs that you both like. Next step? Decorate the jar with tiny lights, pieces of lace or stickers.

### A love poem for your loved one

 Look no further if you need a love poem or a love song for your jar. It doesn’t necessarily need to be original. It just has to come from the heart. Here’s**a love song for your love jar:**

 Verse 1:  
_My heart beats fast_
_Whenever you’re near, I’m under your spell_
_You light up my world, like a firework_
_I love you, it’s plain to see, you’re my everything_
 Chorus:  
_I love you, with every breath I take_
_I’ll love you, for all the choices I make_
_I love you, with every step I take_
_I’ll love you, for all the chances I take_
 Verse 2:  
_With you, everything feels right_
_With you, everything falls into place_
_With you, I can reach new heights_
_With you, nothing can replace_
 Chorus:  
_I love you, with every breath I take_
_I’ll love you, for all the choices I make_
_I love you, with every step I take_
_I’ll love you, for all the chances I take_

 If, on the other hand, you’d rather choose a poem, here’s a very cute idea:

_Love is a feeling that cannot be tamed,_
_A fire that burns, a love that’s claimed._
_With you, my heart skips a beat,_
_With you, my life is complete._

_A love like ours is worth the fight,_
_With you, everything feels just right._
_In your arms, I am safe and warm,_
_With you, forever, I’ll be adorned._

_With every moment, every day,_
_I feel my love for you grow in every single way._
_You are my everything, my one true love,_
_Forever and always, to you, I’ll be true._

_Love is a journey, let’s take the ride,_
_Together, forever, side by side._
_With you, my love will never end,_
_With you, my heart will forever blend._
