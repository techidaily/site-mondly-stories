## Lenguaje Animal: Lista De 60 Nombres Hispanoparlantes

 Hola, Spanish language aficionado! Welcome to another basic lesson about**animals in Spanish.** Whether you want to find out what_el gato_ means or how to say ‘dog’ in Spanish, stick around and read on. From fluffy pets to animals from the savannah or sea creatures, we’re going to explore the entire animal kingdom in search of a complete list of animals in Spanish.

 Big, small, cute, or menacing, furry or not, all animals are our neighbors on Earth. That’s why we should always remember to respect their boundaries. After all, we share a home and a trophic pyramid in which each species plays a crucial role. Except for the cat, of course. The cat is only here to make Zoom calls fun.

 Now that we’ve settled that let’s discuss what was promised: the animals in Spanish or_los animales en español._

## Pets and other domestic animals in Spanish

 Animals are a universal topic of conversation, thanks mainly to our pets. That’s why studying their names in Spanish is considered one of the most [basic Spanish lessons](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-6151&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-6151?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-6151?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es) , together with the [days of the week](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) and saying [hello](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) . Besides, the animals and the sounds they make are also one of the first things we learn as children. It only makes sense to follow the same “recipe” when learning a new language as adults.

 **Here are the most popular farm animals and pets and their names in Spanish:**

* _el pájaro_ – the bird
* _el toro_ – the bull
* _el gato_ – the cat
* _el pollo_ – the chicken
* _la vaca_ – the cow
* _el perro_ – the dog
* _el burro_ – the donkey
* _el pato_ – the duck
* _el pez_ – the fish
* _la cabra_ – the goat
* _la gallina_ – the hen
* _el caballo_ – the horse
* _el cerdo_ – the pig
* _el cachorro_ – the puppy
* _el conejo_ – the rabbit
* _el gallo_ – the rooster
* _la oveja_ – the sheep
* _la tortuga_ – the turtle

 “Helloooo” by thapanee srisawat©

 Known as_las mascotas_ in Spanish, the pets (together with the farm animals) make up most of the basic Spanish vocabulary about animals. Considering that they live in our homes or yards, it’s more likely to mention them during a conversation in Spanish rather than a zebra or a lion.

## Birds and land animals in Spanish

 Now you know that_un gato_ is ‘a cat’ and_un burro_ is a donkey in Spanish. But there are so many more wild animals out there. From mammals to insects, reptiles, and birds – they all have their own names in Spanish.

 Are you ready to move on to the wilderness? Let’s see how to say ‘lion’ in Spanish.

### Grammatical gender in Spanish

 If you are wondering what’s the correct [grammatical gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical%5Fgender%5Fin%5FSpanish) for all these animals, let’s look at a short explanation.

 As a general rule, nouns ending in -o in Spanish are masculine. On the other hand, nouns ending in -a are feminine. However, most animals in Spanish have both a male and a female form. But not all of them. For example, ‘the cat’ can be_el gato_ (masculine) or_la gata_ (feminine), but_el hámster_ will always be masculine.

## Aquatic animals and their names in Spanish

 Last but not least, let’s boost your Spanish vocabulary with the Spanish names of fish and other aquatic animals.
