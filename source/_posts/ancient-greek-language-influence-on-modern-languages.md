## Ancient Greek Language Influence on Modern Languages

 In the fascinating world of historical linguistics, the ancient Greek language is like a powerful god, casting long and tangled beams of influence toward modern languages and beyond. And that’s only natural. **Humanity’s most foundational knowledge was first articulated in the ancient Greek language.** Whether we’re talking about Plato’s dialogues, Homer’s_Iliad_ , or the forward-looking explorations in science, astronomy, and mathematics, we owe a lot to ancient Greece and its language.

 So, let’s embark on a journey through time and explore the history of the ancient Greek language. We will look at its profound impact on modern languages and culture and how it differs from modern Greek. With a little help from the Greek gods and goddesses, you’ll see that ancient Greek is not a relic of the past but a living legacy echoing everywhere in the modern world.

 Men think about the Roman Empire a lot, but I believe ancient Greece is just as fascinating. What do you think?



## Ancient Greek Language – Historical Journey

 Stretching over millennia, **the historical journey of the ancient Greek language can be considered as epic as Homer’s_Odyssey_ .** Spoken by some of the most influential people in human history, ancient Greek has known the world in a way we never will.

 But before going over its tale, a clarification needs to be made. When we say “ancient Greek”, most think of the language spoken before our era. However, what we call “ancient Greek” is actually just a phase in the evolution of the [Greek language](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Greek-language) . The periods in which the Greek language was divided are:

* **Proto-Greek:** This is the earliest form of Greek that was not directly attested but inferred.
* **Mycenaean Greek:** Dating from the 16th to 12th centuries BC, it’s the most ancient attested form of Greek.
* **Ancient Greek:** Used during the “Dark Ages” and Classical periods (1200-300 BC), this version of Greek was spoken widely across regions and was used in literature and philosophy.
* **Hellenistic Greek (Koine):** A common dialect that evolved following Alexander the Great’s conquests. It was the lingua franca across the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East and the language of the Christian New Testament.
* **Medieval Greek:** Spanned from the 5th to 6th centuries to the 15th century, representing the language of the Byzantine Empire.
* **Modern Greek:** This is the contemporary version of Greek, influenced by historical events like the Ottoman rule and the establishment of the modern Greek state. The language underwent purification, removing foreign influences, and there were debates over its official form.

 **The Greek language has one of the longest written records of any language,** first appearing in a syllabic script on clay tablets from the 14th-13th centuries BCE and resurfacing after a four-century gap in the Greek alphabet. It belongs to the**Indo-European family of languages,** which includes Sanskrit, Latin, and Germanic languages, tracing back to a common ancestor, Proto-Indo-European.

 Spanning an oral tradition of 4,000 years and a written tradition of 3,500 years, Greek boasts the lengthiest lineage among Indo-European languages, making it one of the [oldest languages in the world](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) . Many consider it unique due to its unbroken historical continuity and we can’t help but agree!

### Ancient Greek – the language of the Homeric Poems

 Ancient Greek, the language of the “Dark Ages” and the Archaic and Classical periods (1200-300 BCE), emerged following the fall of the Mycenaean civilization. Despite the abandonment of the standardized Mycenaean language, local vernacular dialects persisted and evolved into various Greek dialects over time.

 These dialects were significantly influenced by social interactions, economic activities, tribal mixings, and conflicts, leading to a collective linguistic and cultural consciousness among the Greek people. Ancient Greek dialects heavily influenced the era’s literature, with each piece closely tied to a specific dialect that reflected the Greek tribe and its unique socio-economic contexts.

 Ancient Greek writing during this archaic period featured the “Boustrophedon” style (literally “ox-turning”, after the manner of an ox plowing a field), where alternate lines of text were reversed, a technique observed in earlier civilizations. Nevertheless, around the 8th century BC, the Greek alphabet was standardized.

### Dialects of Ancient Greece

 **Before the conquest by the Macedonians in the late 4th century BCE, there was no unified Greek language;** rather, various competing dialects existed. Each city or region had its standard for inscriptions, and though these dialects were diverse, the Greeks had a concept of a shared linguistic identity and could understand other dialects.

 These dialects, including Attic and Ionic, Aeolic, Arcadocypriot, and Doric, with sub-dialects like Macedonian Greek, resulted from the Greek tribes’ geographic dispersion, varied settlement locations, and political autonomy.

 Naturally, this complex linguistic landscape, characterized by many dialects and writing styles, highlights nothing more than the rich diversity and evolution of the ancient Greek language.

### Iconic texts written in the ancient Greek language

 **The most important pieces of writing we have from this period are the Homeric Poems:_The Iliad_ and_The Odyssey_ .** The two epic poems are foundational to Greek education and culture and remain pivotal works in European literary tradition._The Iliad_ narrates the rage of Achilles during the Trojan War, while_The Odyssey_ follows Odysseus’s journey home after the war. Over time, the composition methods of these epics have been a subject of extensive debate between experts.

Other literary works of art representative of this period include:

* **Plato’s Dialogues**
* **Sappho’s poems**
* **Herodotus’ Histories**
* **Euripides’ tragedies**
* **Aesop’s fables**
* **Sophocles’ tragedies**

 Many of these names seem familiar because their works were so forward-looking they are still relevant today. Ancient Greece has not only inspired epic tales but has also infused the Western ethos with archetypal narratives, symbolic imagery and food for thought for millennia to come. Now you see why this period in time is so talked about!

## Ancient Greek Writing System and Alphabet

 Did you know the word **‘alphabet’ originates from the initial two letters of the Greek alphabet,_‘alpha’_ and_‘beta’_ ?** While this may seem like a fun piece of unimportant trivia, you’ll soon discover that the influence of the ancient Greek language on modern languages is far greater than we think.

 The Greek alphabet, a symphony of symbols, laid the foundational notes for the Latin, Cyrillic, Armenian, Coptic, and Gothic writing systems, among many others. Used for approximately 2,800 years to this day, it is the earliest known alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels and consonants. Greeks adopted and adapted it from the earlier Phoenician alphabet.

 However, the earliest attested form of the Greek language is a clay tablet written in the Linear B script. Historians claim that it dates to between 1450 and 1350 BC. Unrelated to the Greek alphabet, which emerged around the 8th century BC, Linear B last appeared in the 13th century BC. The centuries between the two writing scripts, where no Greek writings have been found, is referred to as the Greek Dark Ages.

## Cultural Influences of Ancient Greek on the Western Civilization

 Ancient Greece’s influence on Western civilization is undeniable, and you’ll soon see why. For example, where do you think the Olympic Games came from? Or where did democracy originate? They’re both products of Ancient Greece, of course!

**[The Ancient Olympic Games](https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Greece/The-Olympic-Games) were held at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece,** every four years. Unsurprisingly, the origins of the Ancient Olympics are rooted in myth and legend, notably involving Hercules and Zeus. It’s believed Hercules (or Heracles) named the Games ‘Olympic’ and introduced the tradition of hosting them every four years. After finishing his twelve labors, Hercules supposedly built the Olympic Stadium to honor Zeus. He then marked a distance called “stadion” after walking 200 steps, which became a unit of measurement.

 We can’t know how much of this is true. But one thing we know for sure: **inscriptions at Olympia place the inception of the Ancient Olympics in 776 BC.** Apparently, they reached their peak somewhere between the 6th and 5th centuries BCE and then slowly declined in significance as the Romans gained influence in Greece.

 From politics and governance to philosophy and science, Greek terminologies and ideas laid the foundations for Western thought. Words like ‘democracy’, ‘philosophy’, and ‘astronomy’ are testimonials of Ancient Greek’s influence on today’s world. But let’s go into a little more detail.

### Ancient Greek influence on governance and philosophy

 Given the fact that democracy and republicanism originated in ancient Greece, it’s no wonder that the lexicon of modern governance is replete with Greek-rooted words.

 The principles of Western political thought were shaped by the Greek ideals of democracy, rooted in the philosophies of thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates. More precisely, **the ideas laid out in Aristotle’s_Politics_ have become integral to how modern societies practice democracy.**

 At the same time, the ideas of these influential thinkers on logic, ethics, and metaphysics also continue to influence contemporary philosophical debates and guide our exploration of fundamental questions about existence, morality, and the nature of reality. Their brilliant minds concocted theses that are still relevant millennia later. Isn’t it mind-blowing?

 If you had any doubts about ancient Greece’s influence, know that the word ‘philosophy’ itself is of Greek origin. It is derived from ‘philosophia’, which means “love of wisdom”.

### Ancient Greek influence on art, architecture, and literature

 Beyond politics and philosophy, Greek mythology is probably the one that influenced Western culture the most. The epic tales of gods, goddesses, demigods, and heroes have inspired numerous artists, writers, and thinkers to create their next big work of art. If you look into it, you’ll see that the influence of Greek myths can still be found everywhere, from literature and sculpture to popular culture and advertising.

 At the same time, the ancient Greek epics and plays are also foundational for Western literature. Some of the most popular tragedies and comedies in history are still those of ancient Greece. Examples include**the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides** and**the comedies of Aristophanes.**

 Just as significant for the modern world are the ancient Greek art and architecture. The principles of symmetry, harmony, and proportionality influenced Western architectural designs, including the construction of monuments and public buildings. The Greek column, for example, is a beloved element we’ve seen even in fashion!

### Ancient Greek influence on science and mathematics

 If we ask scientists, they’ll say that ancient Greeks made their most significant contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. For example, **the principles and theorems formulated by Pythagoras are integral to the scientific heritage that has shaped Western civilization.** Nowadays, children as young as 12 or 13 learn Pythagoras’ theorems in geometry – which, by the way, is another word of Greek origin.

 Another excellent example of how the great thinkers of ancient Greece influenced the way our world looks like today is Hippocrates. Considered**the “Father of Modern Medicine”, Hippocrates’** name is well-known even by those not familiar with medical practices due to his famous ethics oath called**the Hippocratic Oath.** Initially, the oath mandated a new physician to vow, invoking several healing deities, to adhere to particular ethical guidelines. It represents the Western world’s first articulation of medical ethics, laying down foundational principles that continue to be critically important even in today’s medical ethics.

 As you can see, Ancient Greece’s cultural influence is a treasure trove of wisdom that continues to inspire and shape the Western world to this day. These were only a few of the ideas and personalities that persisted through the ages. If you care to study the entire period of Ancient Greece, you’ll discover that many more people thought, said, or did great things during this time. So many that we start to wonder whether they had access to a magical fountain of endless inspiration!
