## Ingeniería Del Lenguaje: Identificación De Cognados Falsos

 The best thing about learning Spanish from English is that there are hundreds of words – better known as “Spanish cognates” – you already know even if you never studied Spanish before in your life. But there are also words you_only_ _think_ you know. Words like_embarazada_ . And well… that’s where you could get in trouble.

 Luckily, we are coming to your aid with a comprehensive list of some of the most common English-Spanish cognates and false Spanish cognates. Read on to understand the differences and choose the correct words for your next conversation in Spanish.

## What are cognates, false cognates and false friends?

 In linguistics,**cognates** are known as words from different languages that have the same root or origin and share the same meaning. For example, when it comes to English-Spanish cognates, the common root comes from Latin and/or Greek.

 As an English speaker wanting to learn Spanish, cognates give you a huge advantage when it comes to your [Spanish vocabulary](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) . Simply identifying the words that share similar spelling and meaning in English and Spanish gives you access to hundreds or maybe thousands of words you already know and could use.

 Not to be confused with false friends,**false cognates** are words that sound and look similar but do not come from a common root. For example, the English “much” and the Spanish “mucho” are phonetically and semantically similar but came from completely different Proto-Indo-European roots.

 “We are not false friends!” by Alvan Nee©

 Last, but definitely not least,**false friends** are the trouble-makers that sound and look similar, but have completely different meanings. This is obviously the case of the Spanish word_embarazada_ which may look like the English “embarrassed” but actually translates to “pregnant”.

 Do not worry though! In the following paragraphs, we will cover all the Spanish-English false friends you absolutely need to know in order to avoid… embarrassing situations.

## Perfect English-Spanish cognates

 The easiest Spanish cognates are those with no spelling changes. These are called “perfect cognates” because they are written the same in both English and Spanish. Nevertheless, as you might guess, the Spanish pronunciation is different.

 Some of the most popular examples are: _hospital, horrible, actor, artificial, agenda, animal, original, idea, flexible, vulnerable, superficial, reunion_ (_reunión_ in Spanish)_, melon, interminable, inevitable, tropical, experimental, excursion_ (_excursión_ in Spanish)_, capital, chocolate, probable, conclusion_ (_conclusión_ in Spanish) _, doctor, director, festival, general, individual, nostalgia, panorama, television_ (_televisión_ in Spanish)_, perfume, total, similar, terror_ and_verbal._

## Near-perfect English-Spanish cognates

 Did you know that about 90% of Spanish cognates have the same meaning in English? The rest of them are, obviously, false friends words. This means you have only a 10% chance of saying something embarrassing or awkward. That’s not too bad, isn’t it? Besides, after reading this article the percent will surely drop significantly. Even below 0 if you also start [learning Spanish with Mondly](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-4685&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-4685?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-4685?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es) right now (wink wink).

 But before going there, we have one more type of English-Spanish cognates: near-perfect cognates or words that have the same meaning in both languages, but slightly different spelling.

## Spanish-English False Friend Words

 The absolute trouble-makers, the creators of embarrassing situations, the rebels that don’t obey the rules are, undoubtedly, the false friend words. As already mentioned, these words may be similar but have completely meanings. So don’t let yourself be fooled by their appearance. Here’s a list of some of the most “dangerous” pairs of false friend words:

* **_embarazada_ and embarrassed**

 This definitely needs another mention. Although it looks a lot like embarrassed,_embarazada_ actually means “pregnant” in Spanish.

* **_pie_ and pie**

 They may be written exactly the same, but the Spanish “pie” is pronounced_pee-eh_ and translates to “foot”. That’s surely not a confusion you’d want to make, is it?‌

* **_recordar_ and record**

 In Spanish, to remember something is_recordar_ (_Debo recordar lavar los platos –_ I must remember to do the dishes). If you want to use the verb “to record” in Spanish, the word you are looking for is_grabar_ .

* **_molestar_ and molest**

 Contrary to its appearance,_molestar_ in Spanish means “to annoy”. Phew, this is a really nasty one! Suddenly, what your Spanish colleague said about the boss makes a lot more sense (hahaha).

* **_delito_ and delight**

 Coming from the Latin_dēlictum_ (“crime, misdeed”),_delito_ actually translates to “crime” in Spanish.

* **_largo_ and large**

 Even experienced Spanish second-language speakers get headaches with this one. Although it looks like the English “large”,_largo_ actually means “long” in Spanish. Mind-twisting, I know.

 “Haha! Gotcha!” by olio creative©

* **_enviar_ and to envy**

 Coming from Late Latin_inviāre_ , which is derived from Latin_via_ (“path, road”),_enviar_ means “to send” in Spanish. You can also keep in mind the fact that it looks a lot like Portuguese_enviar_ , French_envoyer_ , Italian_inviare_ .

* **_asistir_ and assist**

 While “to assist” means “to help”, the Spanish_asistir_ means “to attend”.

* **_ropa_ and rope**

 Actually sharing a common root with the English “robe”,_ropa_ translates to “clothes”. So yeah,_abuela_ didn’t put the rope in the washing machine, but the clothes.

* **_éxito_ and exit**

 Imagine the bewilderment on someone’s face when you exit the cinema and ask them_“donde esta el éxito?”_ . It might get philosophical really fast. And that’s because_éxito_ actually means “success” in Spanish.

* **_actual_ and actual**

 Another mind-twister._Actual_ in Spanish actually means “current”. If you want to say “actual”, you should use_real_ or_en realidad_ for “actually”.

* **_realizar_ and realize**

_Realizar_ in Spanish means “to do” or “to perform” and not “to realize”. Tricky!
