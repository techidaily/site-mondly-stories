## Stille Hilfe Durch Worte: Deutsche Entschuldigungsstrategien

 Supposing you’re going to a German-speaking country or just [learning German](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) , one of the first things you need to know is how to say “sorry” in German. Often overlooked in basic vocabulary lessons, “sorry” can come up in daily situations more often than you think. Besides, it’s as easy to learn as the simple [“hello”](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) and just as effective!

 Let’s look at the most important ways to say “sorry” in German and when to use each of them.

## When should you say you’re sorry?

 What you need to remember is that learning how to say “sorry” in German also has a cultural component. It’s not enough to learn how to say you’re sorry; you also have to learn_when_ to say you’re sorry. Unlike Americans and even Brits who apologize quite a lot,**Germans tend to keep their sorrys to a minimum.** In fact, they say sorry so rarely that they can come off as rude to people of other nationalities.

 However, this is not strictly a German thing. It’s true Germans say sorry once in a blue moon, but there are some other countries like France or Russia where over-apologizing can be regarded as insincere as well.

## How to apologize in German

_**Es tut mir leid**_ is the standard sorry or the apologetic sorry. It’s the kind of sorry you say when you messed up and you want to apologize for what you did. The expression conveys a sense of responsibility it is kind of a formal apology.

 If you want it to be more informal, you can say_**Tut mir leid**_ which is more similar to “sorry” than “I’m sorry”.

Here are some practical examples of apologies in German:

* _Es tut mir schrecklich leid!_ – I’m terribly sorry!
* _Sie haben Recht, das tut mir leid._  – You are right, I am sorry.
* _Tut mir leid, ich mag die Suppe nicht._ – Sorry, I don’t like the soup.

## How to say sorry in German – the “Excuse me” sorry

 If you bump into someone on the street or cause a mishap, the most common way to say “sorry” in German is_**Entschuldigung**_ which literally means “apology!”. This is basically the “sorry” or the “excuse me” you say for a minor inconvenience. In other words, we’re talking about a slight bump or barely touching that person. If you knock them over, a cool_Entschuldigung_ won’t do, so you should probably apologize sincerely.

 In case you need a more**formal sorry** for someone you don’t know or someone older, you should say**_Entschuldigen Sie._** For **informal situations,_Entschuldige_ works best** or you can use the abbreviated_**‘Tschuldigung**_ .

 Hear the formal_Entschuldigen Sie_ in action in this basic conversation in German:
