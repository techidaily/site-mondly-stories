## **What is Independence Day USA?**

241 years ago, namely in 1776, on July 4th, the American people gained their independence from British rule, signing a Declaration of Independence. Thirteen colonies under the governing and rule of Great Britain legally separated from them and became independent. From 1870 on (the year it was officially made the American National Day), year after year, the 4th of July is synonymous with American Independence Day and fireworks. American families from all over the country – and outside of it – prepare parties, parades, barbecues, carnivals, fairs, picnics, and other celebrations in order to commemorate American Independence Day.

The biggest attractions are the 4th of July fireworks. Cities all over the USA compete against each other in who has the biggest and the most long-lasting firework display. Not only this but right before the day itself, they offer details on their websites on where is the best place to go to see the 4th of July fireworks, what you can find there – apart from the show – and what other events they have scheduled for the American Independence Day.

## American Independence Day: Did you know?

According to historical documents, July 2nd is the real Independence Day of the USA, but it’s celebrated on the fourth. Why? Well, two days before the 4th of July, the Second Continental Congress voted to approve a resolution of independence. This had been proposed in June by Richard Henry Lee of Virginia. This resolution declared the United States independent from Great Britain rule. But in order to make the decision legal, they needed the Declaration of Independence, a document which had been prepared by Thomas Jefferson and a Committee of Five. Congress debated for two days and approved it on 4th of July, which was to become the American Independence Day.

### What is the significance of the 4th of July in the United States?

The 4th of July is celebrated as Independence Day in the United States. It commemorates the country's declaration of independence from Great Britain on July 4, 1776.
