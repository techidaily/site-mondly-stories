## Elevate Your Pronunciation with Dynamic Tongue Twisters

``

``

` __ Listen `

``

 Tongue twisters of all sorts and sizes have been helping people to perfect their pronunciation in English for decades. Although they don’t make a lot of sense, tongue twisters are very helpful in speech therapy due to their repeated sounds. For this reason, they are used by actors, politicians and even news anchors before going live. Essentially, a tongue twister works like a physical exercise: the more you practice, the better your pronunciation will be.

 According to the [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/tongue-twister) , a tongue twister is **“a sentence or phrase that is intended to be difficult to say, especially when repeated quickly and often”** . If you too want to improve or perfect your [English pronunciation](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) , dive into the complete list of**English tongue twisters** listed below: from short tongue twisters to tongue twisters for kids and hard tongue twisters to further challenge your pronunciation.

## **Long tongue twisters**

 When it comes to long tongue twisters and talking fast, we can’t help but think about Eminem. Did you know that he raps with a whopping speed of 11.4 syllables per second in his song “Rap God”? We don’t know much about rap, but that sure sounds like something only the God of Rap could do.

 But Eminem’s songs and long tongue twisters are challenging for those who are not ready for long runs. Are you? Can you defeat Eminem? Let’s find out. Take a deep breath and try saying the following tongue twister without stopping.

1. All I want is a proper cup of coffee.  
 Made in a proper copper coffee pot.  
 You can believe it or not.  
 But I want a cup of coffee from a proper copper pot.  
 Tin coffee pots or iron coffee pots, they’re not good to me.  
 If I can’t have a proper cup of coffee from a proper copper coffee pot, I’ll just have tea.  
 All I want is a proper cup of coffee.  
 Made in a proper copper coffee pot.  
 You can believe it or not.  
 But I want a cup of coffee from a proper copper pot.
2. To sit in solemn silence in a dull, dark dock,  
 In a pestilential prison, with a life-long lock,  
 Awaiting the sensation of a short, sharp shock,  
 From a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block!  
 To sit in solemn silence in a dull, dark dock,  
 In a pestilential prison, with a life-long lock,  
 Awaiting the sensation of a short, sharp shock,  
 From a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block!  
 A dull, dark dock, a life-long lock,  
 A short, sharp shock, a big black block!  
 To sit in solemn silence in a pestilential prison,  
 And awaiting the sensation  
 From a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block!
3. Betty Botter bought some butter but, said she, the butter’s bitter.  
 If I put it in my batter, it will make my batter bitter.  
 But a bit of better butter will make my bitter batter better.  
 So she bought some better butter, better than the bitter butter,  
 put it in her bitter batter, made her bitter batter better.  
 So ‘t was better Betty Botter bought some better butter.
4. I’m a mother pheasant plucker, I pluck mother pheasants.  
 I’m the most pleasant mother pheasant plucker to ever pluck a mother pheasant.  
 I’m not the pheasant plucker I’m the pheasant plucker’s wife, I’ve been plucking Mother pheasants my whole pheasant plucking life.  
 I’m not the pheasant plucker I’m the pheasant plucker’s mate, I’m only plucking Pheasants ’cause the pheasant plucker’s late.
5. A tree-toad loved a she-toad  
 Who lived up in a tree.  
 He was a two-toed tree-toad,  
 But a three-toed toad was she.  
 The two-toed tree-toad tried to win  
 The three-toed she-toad’s heart,  
 For the two-toed tree-toad loved the ground  
 That the three-toed tree-toad trod.  
 But the two-toed tree-toad tried in vain;  
 He couldn’t please her whim.  
 From her tree-toad bower,  
 With her three-toed power,  
 The she-toad vetoed him.

1. Mr. See owned a saw.  
 And Mr. Soar owned a seesaw.  
 Now, See’s saw sawed Soar’s seesaw  
 Before Soar saw See,  
 Which made Soar sore.  
 Had Soar seen See’s saw  
 Before See sawed Soar’s seesaw,  
 See’s saw would not have sawed  
 Soar’s seesaw.  
 So See’s saw sawed Soar’s seesaw.  
 But it was sad to see Soar so sore  
 just because See’s saw sawed  
 Soar’s seesaw.
2. Ned Nott was shot and Sam Shott was not.  
 So it is better to be Shott than Nott.  
 Some say Nott was not shot.  
 But Shott says he shot Nott.  
 Either the shot Shott shot at Nott was not shot,  
 Or Nott was shot.  
 If the shot Shott shot shot Nott, Nott was shot.  
 But if the shot Shott shot shot Shott,  
 Then Shott was shot, not Nott.  
 However, the shot Shott shot shot not Shott, but Nott.
3. Theophilus Thistle, the Thistle Sifter,  
 Sifted a sieve of unsifted thistles.  
 If Theophilus Thistle, the Thistle Sifter,  
 Sifted a sieve of unsifted thistles,  
 Where is the sieve of un-sifted thistles  
 Theophilus Thistle, the Thistle Sifter, sifted?
4. A flea and a fly in a flue  
 Said the fly “Oh what should we do”  
 Said the flea” Let us fly  
 Said the fly “Let us flee”  
 So they flew through a flaw in the flue.
5. Of all the felt I ever felt,  
 I never felt a piece of felt  
 which felt as fine as that felt felt,  
 when first I felt that felt hat’s felt.

## **Hard tongue twisters**

 While we’re at it, we can help but wonder what the**hardest tongue twister** in existence is. Contrary to popular belief, it’s not supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

 At one point, **“the sixth sick sheikh’s sixth sheep’s sick” held the Guinness World Record for the hardest twister,** but since the category no longer exists, the title was probably revoked.

11. These thousand tricky tongue twisters trip thrillingly off the tongue.
12. Thirty-three thirsty, thundering thoroughbreds thumped Mr. Thurber on Thursday.
13. Brisk brave brigadiers brandished broad bright blades, blunderbusses, and bludgeons—balancing them badly.
14. A skunk sat on a stump and thunk the stump stunk, but the stump thunk the skunk stunk.

18. Many an anemone sees an enemy anemone.
19. Chop shops stock chops.

### Tongue twisters with TH

1. The thirty-three thieves thought that they thrilled the throne throughout Thursday.
2. I thought a thought.

3. Something in a thirty-acre thermal thicket of thorns and thistles thumped and thundered threatening the three-D thoughts of Matthew the thug – although, theatrically, it was only the thirteen-thousand thistles and thorns through the underneath of his thigh that the thirty-year-old thug thought of that morning.
4. Thirty-three thousand feathers on a thrushes throat.

 The world-famous **_Peter Piper_ tongue twister** first appeared in print sometime in 1813, in a [book](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199695140.001.0001/acref-9780199695140-e-2560#) called **“Peter Piper’s Practical Principles of Plain and Perfect Pronunciation”,** though it is believed that it may have already been in common use by that time. Fast forward to today, people all around the world still love to have a laugh and twist their tongues with this rhyme and many others. And now you do too.
