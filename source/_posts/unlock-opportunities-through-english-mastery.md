## Why English Matters Globally

 English matters globally because it has become the_lingua franca_ of the world.

 A_lingua franca,_ literally “Frankish tongue”, also known as a bridge language, trade language, or link language, is adopted to facilitate communication between groups of people who do not share a native language.

 This definition perfectly describes English. To address the initial question:[English](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/eng/) matters globally because it is now the most widely spoken language in the world, serving as the primary means of communication in many sectors, including business, education, science, tourism, aviation, and international diplomacy. But how did English get chosen for such an important task?

### How Did English Become So Widespread?

 The spread of the English language can largely be attributed to the British Empire, the largest empire in history. As the United Kingdom expanded its influence worldwide, English spread alongside it.

 To further add to this, the emergence of the United States as a global superpower after World War II only strengthened English’s status as a global language.

 These historical events have led to English becoming the dominant language of the internet, media, and popular culture, further cementing its role as a crucial tool for global connectivity and understanding. Its importance is not just in the number of people who speak it but also in its capacity to bring together individuals from diverse backgrounds, fostering a global community.

## English for Seamless Travel Experiences

 Do you enjoy traveling? If so, learning English can greatly improve your trips.

Imagine traveling to a foreign country and not being able to order the food you wanted because you can’t communicate with the waiter. English can bridge that gap.

 Of course, learning the local language is best, but English will help you almost anywhere around the world.

 Let’s discover how speaking English can improve your travel experiences.**By knowing English, you will be able to:**

* Ask for directions when needed.
* Understand signs, such as “Exit” in subway stations, even in countries like Japan.
* Order your preferred dishes in restaurants without fear of misunderstandings.
* Participate in tours and activities that may only be available in English.
* Communicate with locals and other travelers more easily, creating opportunities for deeper cultural exchanges and friendships.
* Navigate through airports, train stations, and bus terminals with confidence.
* Access emergency services or medical assistance without language barriers.
* Make well-informed decisions while shopping, comprehending product descriptions, and haggling prices where it’s customary.
* Use online resources more effectively, as many websites, apps, and customer service hotlines operate in English.

 Speaking English can significantly enhance your travel experience, making it more enjoyable, safe, and enriching. It empowers you to be more independent and confident as you explore the world.

## Everyday Benefits of Speaking English

 The everyday benefits of speaking English are countless—take it from the millions of people who learned English as an additional language. Wherever you are in the world, learning English is one of the best personal investments.

 Having covered the reasons to learn English and the advantages of being fluent in English, let’s dvelve into detail with some of the most important benefits of speaking English.

### Unlimited internet exploration

 For me, as someone who learned English as a second language, this is perhaps the most significant benefit. Without English, I wouldn’t have grown, learned, and certainly wouldn’t be writing this article for you.

 Do you have a household issue? Or perhaps a question about… virtually anything? While finding answers in your native language might be challenging, English likely offers a solution. Don’t go as far as to google your symptoms, as you may fall into a trap, but anything else – go for it!

### Endless content streaming & books

 Another reason why I love knowing English is being able to read any book I want. I read “The Lord of the Rings” in my native language many years ago, but translation rarely does a writer true justice. I was able to fully experience the magic of Middle Earth only I finally read it in English. The same goes for “A Song of Ice and Fire”—reading it in English was the best decision.

 Additionally, the Pearson study mentioned earlier found that 53% of Gen Z respondents learn English to enjoy movies, shows, and online content. Streaming services might offer subtitles, but many YouTube creators do not. So, that is one more benefit of speaking English.

### Professional success

 Knowing English opened career opportunities for me that I had never dreamed possible. And once I got hired, my English skills allowed me to communicate with my global colleagues and make more friends. As a bonus, I was able to progress and get promoted to a better position.

 For me, these three aspects are the most important benefits of speaking English. What about you? Why would you want to learn English?

 In conclusion, the reasons to learn English are undeniable. Being spoken by nearly a fifth of the global population and holding official status across numerous countries and territories, English stands as a vital conduit for international dialogue and opportunity. The question isn’t so much whether one should learn English but rather why one would choose not to. The advantages it offers, ranging from enhanced personal growth to expanded professional possibilities, affirm English’s unparalleled value as the world’s_lingua franca._

 Yes, learning English is essential for career advancement, especially in a globalized economy. Proficiency in English can significantly broaden career opportunities, enabling access to international job markets and roles in multinational corporations.

### Why learn English is difficult?

English is filled with irregular verbs, idiomatic expressions, and homophones (words that sound alike but have different meanings or spellings), which can be confusing for learners. Additionally, it borrows extensively from other languages, resulting in a wide variety of phonetic sounds and spelling rules.
