As a special highlight, the final recommendations are French classics books that everyone should read in their lifetime.

 Naturally, this list is exclusively dedicated to books originally written in French, because reading them in the original language ensures you experience the full depth and nuances, which can sometimes be lost in translation. However, if we’re talking about a very good translation, you can definitely also**read French translations of foreign books.** For instance, after you’ve tackled the first six books on our list, I highly recommend **reading_Harry Potter_ in French.** Targeted at young readers, the initial books in the series are perfectly suited for beginners.

## How to Choose the Best French Books for New Learners

**The best French novels for new learners** are ones you’ve already read. No, really. Take it from me—a language learner at heart. I perfected my English, Spanish, and French by reading books, and I strongly recommend you do the same to improve your French.

**Reading in French,** if your French is not that good,**can be challenging** at first. That’s why I always suggest starting with a book you have already read in your native language. It could be your favorite book or simply one you want to experience again. Being familiar with the story can significantly ease your first foray into reading a book in French.

 As you progress through the pages, you’ll notice a gradual increase in your familiarity with French. You’ll start to deduce the meanings of unknown words from the context and [learn French](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) in a natural way. Even better, if you read an**eBook in French** on a Kindle, you can leverage the dictionary feature to learn new words simply by tapping on them.

 After finishing, you can move on to a book you’ve never read before—in any language. However, depending on your French level, I’d suggest opting for a French novel for beginners, like_Le Petit Prince_ (The Little Prince), which is technically a novella.

 Let’s recap.**This is how to start reading in French:**

1. Read your favorite book first (or just a book you read before) as it will help you get used to reading in French;
2. Continue with a short and accessible book that uses simpler language – like _Le Petit Prince_ (The Little Prince);
3. Repeat the first two steps with different books if reading in French doesn’t feel like home yet;
4. Go on with more complex books, but don’t jump straight to French philosophy! Easy does it.

**The secret to choosing the best books to read in French** is to proceed step by step. Begin with shorter, simpler books that use straightforward language, and gradually progress to longer and more complex French books. Throughout this journey, avoid putting pressure on yourself. Reading should be enjoyable, especially when you pick genres that you love. So, make the most of your French reading experience — it will significantly benefit your French studies!
