## Usage rules

 One more thing before you go. To make sure you are using your newly acquired French days of the week correctly, don‚Äôt forget that:

* **the days of the week are not capitalized in French** ‚Äì unless, of course, they appear at the beginning of a sentence;
* **the French week starts on Monday;**
* **days of the week are all masculine in French** ‚Äì this means you‚Äôll always have to use masculine articles _(le_ and _un)_  and masculine adjectives when talking about the days of the week. For example, if you want to say ‚Äúthe last Friday of the month was rainy‚Äù in French, you say _‚Äúle dernier vendredi du mois √©tait pluvieux‚Äù;_
* in contrast to _le jour_ , [_la journ√©e_](https://french.kwiziq.com/revision/grammar/when-to-use-an-annee-matin-matinee-jour-journee-soir-soiree-time-unit-vs-duration) (which also translates to ‚Äúday‚Äù) is a feminine noun that refers to a longer period of time during which something might happen. _Jour,_ on the other hand, represents a precise moment, a unit of time. For example: ‚Äú_Je te rendrai visite dans la journ√©e‚Äù_ (‚ÄúI‚Äôll visit you during the day‚Äù) is different from _‚ÄúJe t‚Äôappelle dans deux jours‚Äù_ (‚ÄúI‚Äôll call you in two days‚Äù).
