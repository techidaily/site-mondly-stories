## Language Proficiency and Brain Health Synergy

Bilingualism is transforming the present society. Many people today speak more than one language. Bilingualism gives one a huge leg up in many areas of life. Your communication skills become better, and you are exposed to more opportunities.

**What is Bilingualism?** Bilingualism can be interpreted as the use of more than one language by an individual speaker or an entire society of speakers.

## Main Benefits of Bilingualism

Studies carried out by different individuals and organizations over the years have proven that being bilingual comes with several advantages. For those who have been wondering about the benefits of being bilingual, this post is for you. Here, we take a look at a couple of reasons why you should [speak more than one language](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875).

### **Better Educational Performance**

Bilingual students have been found to possess a heightened intelligence. Numerous studies by York University have shown that bilingual students are more focused and less distracted than monolingual students. Students who have acquired bilingual education, that is, taught using their second language, go ahead in life to have better shots at bilingual jobs.

### **Greater Job Opportunities**

There are bilingual jobs that require employees to act as representatives at branches located in different international communities. Communication is very vital in the workplace, especially at a multinational company. Having the ability to speak another language specified on your resume can make you come out victorious amongst other job applicants who are monolingual.

### **Enhances Communication Skills**

Another fantastic benefit of being bilingual is that it improves your communication skills. By being bilingual, you can travel to a foreign place and communicate better with the natives. The fact that you interact with the locals will make the experience amazing. By communicating with the indigenous using their language, you will get to learn more about the place. Thus making your trip fascinating.

### **Increased Creativity**

Furthermore, being bilingual helps to improve your creativity. Bilingual children or adults have been found to possess advanced creativity. The ability to speak more than one language shapes the brain’s capability to think outside the box and thinking up innovative ways to solve problems. This trait enables bilinguals to pursue bilingual jobs and hobbies.

### **Heightened Cognitive Ability**

In addition, bilinguals are predisposed to enjoy better cognitive skills. At school, students speaking another language perform better in academic tests. Their brain is kept active, alert and sharp to strike a balance when handling different tasks.

### **Improved Health**

The process of learning a second language holds back age-related deteriorating diseases. Bilinguals are less likely to develop dementia and Alzheimer’s disease earlier in life than monolinguals. People who know a second language are also bound to experience low stress levels and better neurological health.

There you have it! Above are some of the benefits of being bilingual. Bilingualism comes with many rewards that can give you an edge in modern society. Speaking a second language places you on top of the chain in this society, above those who are monolinguals. If you are yet to learn a second language, the above are good reasons for you to consider learning one.
