## Essential Communication Tools for Vietnam Tours

 If you’re traveling to Vietnam, a handy list of Vietnamese words and phrases is the best thing you can “pack” in your luggage. If nothing else, knowing a few words in Vietnamese helps you connect with the place a bit more. Besides, the smiles you’ll get from the locals are worth the effort of building a basic vocabulary.
