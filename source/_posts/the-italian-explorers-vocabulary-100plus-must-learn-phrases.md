## 1\. Italian greetings and courtesy phrases

[Italian greetings](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) should always be on top of your list of priorities when packing your bags for a trip to Italy.

So here are the most important**Italian greetings** you should know as a traveler:

* Good morning! –_Buongiorno!_

* Good evening! –_Buonasera!_
* Good night! –_Buonanotte!_
* Hello! –_Salve!_
