## New Learners' Guide to French Literature: 20 Favorite Books

 If you’re currently learning French, the best technique to grow your vocabulary is to read in French. French books for beginners are a great way to get used to the language, learn new French words and start to regard the language as if it were your mother tongue. Not into reading? Fear not. Reading in French is just as effective for your vocabulary, even if you read just short stories or comic books.



## The Best French Novels for Beginners

1. _Le Petit Prince_ (The Little Prince) by Antoine de Saint Exupéry
2. _Le Petit Nicolas_ (Little Nicholas) by René Goscinny
3. _L’Étranger_ (The Stranger) by Albert Camus
4. _Oscar et la dame rose_ (Oscar and the Lady in Pink) by Éric-Emmanuel Schmitt
5. _Astérix le Gaulois_ (Astérix le Gaulois) by René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo
6. _Les Aventures de Tintin_ (The Adventures of Tintin) by Hergé
7. _Arsène Lupin, Gentleman-Cambrioleur_ (Arsène Lupin, Gentleman Thief) by Maurice Leblanc

15. _Madame Bovary_  by Gustave Flaubert
16. _Le Comte de Monte-Cristo_ (The Count of Monte Cristo) by Alexandre Dumas

 If you’re a**beginner eager to read in French,** it’s best to start with the first book on this list of French novels and then progressively work your way through. This approach ensures that as the texts become more complex, your French reading skills will improve accordingly. As a special highlight, the final recommendations are French classics books that everyone should read in their lifetime.

 Naturally, this list is exclusively dedicated to books originally written in French, because reading them in the original language ensures you experience the full depth and nuances, which can sometimes be lost in translation. However, if we’re talking about a very good translation, you can definitely also**read French translations of foreign books.** For instance, after you’ve tackled the first six books on our list, I highly recommend **reading_Harry Potter_ in French.** Targeted at young readers, the initial books in the series are perfectly suited for beginners.

## How to Choose the Best French Books for New Learners

**The best French novels for new learners** are ones you’ve already read. No, really. Take it from me—a language learner at heart. I perfected my English, Spanish, and French by reading books, and I strongly recommend you do the same to improve your French.

**Reading in French,** if your French is not that good,**can be challenging** at first. That’s why I always suggest starting with a book you have already read in your native language. It could be your favorite book or simply one you want to experience again. Being familiar with the story can significantly ease your first foray into reading a book in French.

 As you progress through the pages, you’ll notice a gradual increase in your familiarity with French. You’ll start to deduce the meanings of unknown words from the context and [learn French](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) in a natural way. Even better, if you read an**eBook in French** on a Kindle, you can leverage the dictionary feature to learn new words simply by tapping on them.

 After finishing, you can move on to a book you’ve never read before—in any language. However, depending on your French level, I’d suggest opting for a French novel for beginners, like_Le Petit Prince_ (The Little Prince), which is technically a novella.

 Let’s recap.**This is how to start reading in French:**

1. Read your favorite book first (or just a book you read before) as it will help you get used to reading in French;
2. Continue with a short and accessible book that uses simpler language – like _Le Petit Prince_ (The Little Prince);
3. Repeat the first two steps with different books if reading in French doesn’t feel like home yet;
4. Go on with more complex books, but don’t jump straight to French philosophy! Easy does it.

**The secret to choosing the best books to read in French** is to proceed step by step. Begin with shorter, simpler books that use straightforward language, and gradually progress to longer and more complex French books. Throughout this journey, avoid putting pressure on yourself. Reading should be enjoyable, especially when you pick genres that you love. So, make the most of your French reading experience — it will significantly benefit your French studies!

## Romance French Novels for Incurable Romantics

 My number one rule for reading in French as a beginner is simple: read what you love. If that means diving into**French romance novels,** then embrace it! When you’re starting to read in French, there’s no such thing as a ‘bad’ book genre.

 Think about the types of books you enjoy in your native language. If history books aren’t your thing in English, chances are you won’t suddenly find a passion for them in French.

 Let’s be honest—everyone enjoys a captivating romance novel now and then. The fact that it’s in French only adds to the charm, making it a delightful bonus on your journey to learning French!

 Reading French books offers a multidimensional approach to language learning, immersing readers in the linguistic rhythms, vocabulary, and cultural nuances of the French language. This method not only enhances reading comprehension and vocabulary acquisition but also exposes learners to various grammatical structures and idiomatic expressions in context, promoting a deeper understanding of the language.

### Can short stories help beginners in French reading?

 Yes, short stories are highly beneficial for beginners in French reading. They offer a manageable and engaging way to immerse oneself in the language without the overwhelming commitment required by longer French novels. Short stories provide exposure to diverse vocabulary, grammar, and cultural contexts within a concise format, making it easier for learners to grasp the nuances of French language and storytelling. This format allows for quick comprehension checks and the satisfaction of completing a narrative in a shorter period, encouraging continued reading and practice.

### Are there any free resources for French eBooks and audiobooks?

Project Gutenberg’s French eBook Collection is a treasure trove of French literature, offering a wide range of classic texts in French that are freely available to the public.
