## Learn Urdu online with Mondly

 Urdu is a member of the Indo-European family of languages, the official state language and_lingua franca_ of Pakistan and one of the 22 scheduled languages of India. According to [Ethnologue](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/urd) , Urdu is the 11th most widely spoken language in the world with 170 million total speakers. Hence, learning Urdu with Mondly could come in extremely handy if you ever visit South Asia.

 Also known as one of the premier languages of poetry in South Asia for two centuries, Urdu is written right-to-left using the Urdu alphabet, an extension of the [Persian](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) alphabet, which is itself an extension of the Arabic alphabet. Nevertheless, Urdu speakers in India have recently adopted Devanagari for publishing Urdu periodicals.

 Learn Urdu with Mondly

 One of the most fascinating things about [Urdu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu) is that its colloquial variant is largely mutually intelligible with colloquial Hindi (also available to learn with [Mondly](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-4511&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-4511?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=hi&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-4511?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=hi) ). In fact, these two are so similar in phonology and [grammar that they appear to be one language](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) . However, both languages have borrowed extensively from different sources and use different writing systems ([Hindi](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) uses Devanagari).

 Moreover, in the 19th century, the Hindi–Urdu [controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi%E2%80%93Urdu%5Fcontroversy) arose in colonial India. The debate was whether Hindi or Urdu should be chosen as a national language. In 1900, the government issued a decree granting symbolic equal status to both Hindi and Urdu. But then, Gandhi proposed using either Devanagari or Urdu script, under the traditional generic term Hindustani. Therefore, in 1950, Hindi, in the Devanagari script, along with English, replaced Urdu as one of the official languages of India.
