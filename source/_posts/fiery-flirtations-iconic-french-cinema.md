## Fiery Flirtations: Iconic French Cinema

 Love inspires us to do bold and sometimes crazy things. Things that don’t necessarily identify with our beliefs or everyday actions. Some people move across the globe to be with their loved ones, and others travel long distances on a regular basis. But maybe the most common (yet sweet) behavior is [**learning a new language** in the name of love](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) . Or maybe just a few right words. Because_amour_ and_je t’aime_ sound much more romantic than_love_ and _ [I love you](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) _  . Yes, French has its reputation for being the language of love and [Google Translate has already confirmed this](https://www.thelocal.fr/20141107/french-translates-love-google-language) several times.

 But why do we all consider**French** the universal**language of love** ? Is it a positive stereotype that we have all come to believe? History says “definitely no”. As we can [read for ourselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History%5Fof%5FFrance) today, Paris and the French, in general, had a unique way of embracing art in all its forms. Art, new tendencies, and love, apparently. Being less religious than other Europeans made French people more open about matters that regard love and social emancipation. That and the famous [troubadours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubadour) played a huge part in this matter. This is why the French are, even in the present days, regarded as renowned lovers. Besides, we cannot argue that French sounds particularly melodious and intimate.

 Because lovers all over the world just celebrated Valentine’s Day, I thought that it would be a great time to share with you a list of **7 French movies that will inspire you to learn the language of love** . And I am not talking just about romantic love. Love should be celebrated in all its forms today – every day – even if it’s not Valentine’s Day. So here are 7 movies that will probably throw you on an emotional rollercoaster.

## 1. Un Long Dimanche De Fiançailles (2004)

 Following the story of Mathilde’s relentless search for her fiancé, who has disappeared from the trenches of the Somme during World War I, “Un long dimanche de fiançailles” is a great story of war, survival and, above all,**love** .

 Determined to find out if her childhood sweetheart and fiancé actually died in the war, frail Mathilde slowly starts to resemble a genuine detective. Her journey creates a story about initiation in life and_amour_ that can (or cannot) overcome all odds.

 The combination of period romance, detective story and black comedy is beautifully carved out. Watch it this weekend and let me know what you think about it in the comment section.

## 2. Le Fabuleux Destin d’Amélie Poulain (2002)

 This is a must-see not only for lovers but for everyone who is a fan of visual poetry. Because that’s exactly what Amélie is: visual poetry.

 The film follows the destiny of an innocent and maybe even naive young woman who decides to help those around her and discovers love in the process.

 Screen capture from “Le fabuleux destin d’Amélie Poulain”

 Honestly, it is really hard not to fall under the spell of this charming and deliciously romantic movie. Especially if you had a similar and quirky first-love experience.

## 3. Intouchables (2011)

 If you have a best friend, you definitely have to watch this one. It will touch a chord. Or even two. I’m not even kidding! “Intouchables” follows the story of an unlikely friendship between a quadriplegic grumpy aristocrat and his young and funny caregiver. I mean, can it get more emotional than that?

 This may not sound flattering, but this movie is beautifully predictable (yes, you read that right). And also humorous and extremely touching. In other words, perfect for a chill Sunday afternoon.

 Screen capture from “Intouchables”

 It’s a clash between classes, a story about the healing power of friendship and people. If you ask me, it sounds like the perfect recipe for a movie designed to be a crowd-pleaser.

## 4. Paris, Je t’Aime (2006)

 There’s no need to tell you more about “Paris, je t’aime”. Its title is self-explanatory and even relatable for some of us. Paris is definitely a lovable city. And it has a long history of being a lovable city.[Viking raiders approve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege%5Fof%5FParis%5F%28845%29) this message.

 On the other hand, if you are looking for a movie about a great love story, this is not one of them. Because it is actually about 18 love stories (Gotcha!). Every single one unique in its own way. 18 love stories about French people, tourists or immigrants falling in love. Relatable enough for me.

 Screen capture from “Paris, je t’aime”

 All in all, this is a bohemian’s delight: two hours of short films celebrating love in the most romantic city in the world.

## 5. Jeux d’Enfants (2003)

 I don’t remember when I first fell in love with Marion Cotillard. Theatrically speaking, of course. But there’s a great chance it might have been when I saw this movie. She’s one of the most talented actresses today, and “Jeux d’enfants” was the movie that set her career in motion.

 This movie is for those of us who have a contagious fascination with watching people for whom going too far is never far enough.

 Imagine teasing and tormenting your crush today, as an adult, the same way you did when you were a child. “Jeux d’enfants” is about this on a much larger scale. It’s a game of daring and loving that never ends. Deliciously entertaining!

## 6. L’Auberge Espagnole (2002)

 I was reluctant when a friend of mine first recommended me to see this movie. I honestly thought this was just another lame comedy about the cultural clash between global students. But boy, was I wrong!

“L’auberge espagnole” follows the story of a French student who moves into an apartment in Barcelona together with six other students from all over Europe. They are young, restless and loving. What more can you want?

 If you studied at least one semester in another country, you will relate to this movie and love it. If you didn’t study in another country, you will probably wish you did. Just see it and apply for that Erasmus scholarship already!

 Charming and exhilarating, the end of this movie will leave you wanting more time with its inexperienced characters.

## 7. Les Choristes (2004)

 Music and love are international languages and this heart-warming movie is about both. Following the story of a severely administered boys’ boarding school and how the new teacher uses the healing power of music to change things, “Les Choristes” is infused with nostalgia and love.

 You may think “Les Choristes” is the European emotional version of “Dead Poets Society” and you wouldn’t be wrong. The only difference is that the interpretation of certain music pieces in “Les Choristes” will probably give you goosebumps. Watch this sneak peek and let yourself fall in love with this boy’s voice:

By the way, this is all real singing!
