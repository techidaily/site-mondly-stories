## Expanding Worldviews: Four Intriguing Reasons to Study a New Language After Age 40

Are you thinking about learning a new language in your forties? If you’re concerned that you waited too long to get started, you’ll be glad to know that this is an excellent time in your life to begin a focus on learning new things. Learning a new language at this age has different challenges that when you were in your [20s](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) or [30s](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875).

At this age, you are certainly a mature adult, yet you’re still young enough to have plenty of beautiful times ahead of you. Depending on your career path, you might have two or even three decades left to impress potential employers with your resume, and even if you plan to retire early, being fluent in a foreign language will brighten your world and give you an edge in everything you do.

## **Learn Foreign Languages: Why Your Forties are an Ideal Time to Begin**

### **1\. Learning a Language While Staying Healthy: The Quest to Stay Fit**

For most people, the first signs of the aging process begin showing during the forties. This includes a slowing metabolism. If you’re among the lucky few who are still looking young and fresh at a later age, you’re likely putting in a lot of effort. Daily trips to the gym, skin treatments and regular visits to the spa can all leave you feeling rejuvenated and youthful, but they also add more activities to an already-packed schedule. If it now takes twice as much time and energy to remain fit and healthy, how will you find time to learn a language?

The answer is to practice language learning anywhere and everywhere you can. If you need to spend an extra half hour on the stair climber, use that time to study foreign languages. If you’ve been cooking healthy meals at home, turn off the television and practice speaking with a responsive language-learning app, or even better, a family member who is willing to help you.

No matter how busy your schedule might get, there is time for language learning. Every bit of practice adds up.

### **2\. Learning a Language to Keep the Mind Young: The Quest to Stay Sharp**

Another troubling factor that often comes with age is memory loss. If you’re struggling to remember things, it might make you less confident about learning a language. You might blame it on your age. However, some research suggests that most cognitive abilities don’t begin to decline until after the age of 70, meaning that a lot of the memory troubles you are experiencing might be attributed to other factors, such as a hectic schedule, insufficient sleep, and emotional stress. If you hear people saying that it’s difficult or impossible to learn a language at your age, don’t listen to them. There is no scientific basis for what they are saying, and you should show them that by proving them wrong!

Have you ever heard the common phrase “use it or lose it”? The same principle applies to your mind. By keeping an active mind that is always focused on learning new things, you will slow down the aging process. This makes language learning an ideal part of any healthy routine for your forties.

### **3\. Learning a Language to Avoid Boredom: The Quest to Stay Excited**

By your forties, you’ve likely experienced a variety of relationships and accomplished a number of amazing things. You’ve long since found the perfect spouse, and the two of you are successfully raising a great child. You achieved your goal of getting a college degree long ago, and it has served you well. If everything in your life is ideal, you might find yourself wondering what you should do next.

While most of us might dream of the perfect life, the fact is that humans tend to do best when they have exciting challenges before them. Life tends to throw challenges our way whether we like it or not, but if you’re looking to keep your mind busy and avoid the boredom of an everyday routine that has grown mundane over the years, learning a language is an excellent way to do so. When you wake up each morning excited to work toward a goal you care about, your heart will be full. The best part is that once you master one language, there will always be others to learn if you want to keep going.

### **4\. Learning a Language to Stay Connected: The Quest for Enrichment**

As we grow older, we tend to realize more about the nature of life, and for many of us, this leads to the expansion of our worlds. This isn’t true for everyone, but if you’re the type of person who likes to continue learning as you grow, then you have likely paid more attention to the news, politics and other social issues over time. Maybe you have been reading about the issues going on in other countries around the world, and you’re feeling a desire to connect to other cultures and expand your mind.

Learning foreign languages is an amazing way to deepen your connection to people from around the world. The language learning process will make it possible to hold conversations with people you never would’ve spoken to otherwise. If you live in a diverse city, there will be people all around you in everyday life who might be willing to practice your chosen language, and if you live in a more isolated area, you can meet friends from other countries online. Sky’s the limit when it comes to how much [language learning can enrich your life in your forties and beyond](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875).
