## Spanish Numbering 1-10: The Basics Made Simple

 Just like [days of the week](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) and [greetings](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) , Spanish numbers are essential if you are working on getting that basic [Spanish vocabulary](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5393&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5393?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5393?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es) of yours in shape. Fortunately, learning how to count in Spanish is much easier than going to the gym because Spanish numbers follow a simple and predictable pattern that doesn’t make every muscle in your body sore. Once you know how to count to 10 in Spanish, counting to 20, 30, 100, and beyond is easy.

 Learning how to count is crucial if you decide to [learn Spanish](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) . Although we may not always acknowledge it, numbers or_números_ (as you’d call them in Spanish) are essential to our day-to-day lives. From shopping to setting up a meeting, telling time, or giving someone your phone number – they really are one of the most basic and important language lessons. So let’s crack the mystery and discover what comes after_uno_ ,_dos,_ and_tres_ . Because Pitbull only gets us so far.

## Spanish numbers 1 to 30

 One of my Danish friends discovered how important Spanish numbers actually are when he needed to tell someone [the time in Spanish](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) and had no idea that “five” is_cinco_ in Spanish. So this is a great piece of advice: don’t move to Barcelona without knowing one of the most basic [Spanish lessons](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) first. Especially when it takes just 10 minutes to master it.

 The secret to mastering the Spanish numbers is to learn how to count to 10\. “Is that it?” – you’ll say. Well, not entirely. But the first ten numbers are important for two reasons. One: you will probably use them a LOT. And two: they lay the foundations for the next Spanish numbers. Here is the Spanish numbers 1 to 10:

[count to 10 in Spanish](https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/count-to-10-in-spanish-600x600.jpg "Spanish Numbers: How To Count Numbers In Spanish 2") ](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5393&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5393?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5393?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es)

 Count to 10 in Spanish

 I know what you are thinking. Yeah, there’s also 0 (“zero”) which is_cero_ in Spanish. The pronunciation is a little bit tricky with this one, but if you want to get really good at it, you might wanna [try Mondly](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5393&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5393?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5393?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es) . Apart from effective, bite-sized lessons and real conversations, Mondly also includes crystal-clear audios recorded by fluent voice artists so you can learn from the best.

 Until then, here’s cool audio of a fluent speaker pronouncing the Spanish numbers 1 to 10:

**Good to know:** _uno_becomes an article and changes to_un_if it’s in front of a noun. For example,_un cerdo_translates to “a pig” in English.

### Spanish numbers to 40

 Shopping is great especially when there are sales. But what if you need to ask for the price and the seller says_“sólo cuesta veinte euros”_ ? What do you do if you don’t know that_veinte_ is twenty? For a shirt, that may be cheap, but you probably don’t want to pay twenty euros for a rubber duck. Random example, but you got the point: knowing the bigger Spanish numbers can save the valuable contents of your wallet.

 Back to numbers, once you get to 20, Spanish numbers are easy to build with what you already know. However, the numbers from 11 to 15 are a bit irregular, so you’ll have to remember them by heart:

 11 –_once_

 12 –_doce_

 13 –_trece_

 14 –_catorce_

 15 –_quince_

 Then, from 16 to 19 and even beyond, Spanish numbers are formed following the pattern 10_(diez)_ \+ number.

 16 –_dieciséis_

 17 –_diecisiete_

 18 –_dieciocho_

 19 –_diecinueve_

 Easy, isn’t it? And from here on, the rule stays the same. Once you know the tens, you’ll easily know how to count up to 100_(cien)_ in Spanish. Here’s are the Spanish numbers to 40 in a nutshell:

[spanish numbers](https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/spanish-numbers-1-960x660.jpg "Spanish Numbers: How To Count Numbers In Spanish 3") ](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5393&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5393?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5393?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=es)

 The Spanish numbers up to 40

 As you can see, up to 30 (“thirty”), the numbers are bound together, but from there on they part ways to make counting in Spanish even easier for you. Basically, you won’t say “thirty-one”, but “thirty**and** one”:_treinta y uno_ .

## Count to 100 in Spanish

 As we already settled, counting in Spanish is all about mastering the basics. Now that you know how to count to 40, counting to 100 in Spanish is a piece of cake. Just learn the tens and you are ready to go.

 20 –_veinte_

 30 –_treinta_

 40 –_cuarenta_

 50 –_cincuenta_

 60 –_sesenta_

 70 –_setenta_

 80 –_ochenta_

 90 –_noventa_

 Let’s see some more examples to make sure you understood how Spanish numbers work:

* 43 –_cuarenta y tres_
* 55 –_cincuenta y cinco_
* 62 –_sesenta y dos_
* 79 –_setenta y nueve_
* 84 –_ochenta y cuatro_
* 98 –_noventa y ocho_

## Spanish numbers to 1000 and beyond

 Hundreds shouldn’t scare you either. They are just as simple. Once you know how the hundreds are, you’ll also know the numbers in between.

 100 –_cien_

 101_– ciento uno_

 200 –_doscientos_

 300 –_trescientos_

 400 –_cuatrocientos_

 500 –_quinientos_

 600 –_seiscientos_

 700 –_setecientos_

 800 –_ochocientos_

 900 –_novecientos_

 1000 –_mil_

 Notice how 100 is cien, but once you get to 101 and beyond it changes to_ciento_ ? Additionally, from 200 onwards, we also add an “s” at the end to make it plural:_dosciento, trescientos,_ and so on. And a little secret: in Spanish, the hundreds can be either masculine or feminine (depending on the noun they accompany). For example, “two hundred books” will be _doscient**o** s libros_ , but to say “two hundred apples” we’ll say _doscient**a** s manzanas_ .

Here are some more examples:

* 204 – _doscientos cuatro_
* 323 – _trescientos veintitrés_
* 747 – _setecientos cuarenta y siete_
* 999 – _novecientos noventa y nueve_

![count in Spanish](https://edge.mondly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/count-in-spanish-960x663.jpg "Spanish Numbers: How To Count Numbers In Spanish 4")

 Barcelona, Spain

 If you want to go even further, thousands and millions work exactly like in English: number +_mil_ (“thousand”) or_millón_ (“million”). Here are some examples:

* 3000 – _tres mil_
* 3001 – _tres mil uno_
* 3018 – _tres mil dieciocho_
* 10000 – _diez mil_
* 20000 – _veinte mil_
* 77100 – _setenta y siete mil cien_

 However, to talk about the population of the world or the bank accounts of some of the richest people in the world, you’ll need even bigger numbers:

* million in Spanish is _millón_
* billion in Spanish is _mil millones_ or _un millardo_
* trillion in Spanish is _billón_

 And there you have it! These were the Spanish numbers. BOOM! You’re Mr. Worldwide.
