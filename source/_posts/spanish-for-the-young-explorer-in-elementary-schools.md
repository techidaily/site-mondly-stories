## Spanish for the Young Explorer in Elementary Schools

 In today’s globalized world,**Spanish for kids** stands out as an invaluable learning opportunity. Recognizing the value of bilingualism, it’s vital to tap into the receptiveness of your children’s young minds and introduce them to Spanish while it’s still very easy to learn. Encouraging them to start learning Spanish for kids now will equip them with a skill they can use and appreciate throughout their lives as they mature into global citizens.

 The goal is to instill a lasting love for this Romance language and make learning Spanish a fascinating adventure! So, let’s discover what are the best resources to help kids learn Spanish fast. Whether you’re thinking Spanish songs, books, or cartoons – they’re all included in this comprehensive guide.



## Introduction to Spanish for Kids

 Teaching the little ones anything – from dinosaur names to Spanish for kids – is extremely simple if you know what methods to use. There are no ‘lazy’ children that ‘won’t study’. Only busy adults. If you give them your time and knowledge, kids’ minds will almost literally absorb all kinds of information, from languages to poetry or basic math, in no time.

 How? Well, their brains have a less developed prefrontal cortex. Thus, they tend to use their imagination much more than us. While adults experience functional fixedness and see everything exactly as it is, **children create unexpected connections to help them learn faster.** Obviously, the difficulty level is different. So adults shouldn’t blame their ‘old’ and ‘dusty’ minds for not retaining information but for their lack of imagination.

 Meanwhile, children have no problem associating new words with seemingly unrelated notions they already know. For example, my 4-year-old nephew associates the word_aburrido_ (‘bored’) with_burro_ (‘donkey’) – a Spanish word he already knew. The connection is Eeyore, the iconic donkey from Winnie the Pooh. He says that “Eeyore always looks sad, tired, and bored”.

 So what is the best way to teach your kids Spanish without resorting to endless and sometimes expensive Spanish classes? Read on to discover all the best resources.

## The Benefits of Learning Spanish at a Young Age

 **Learning Spanish for kids holds numerous cognitive and social benefits,** especially when starting at a very young age.[Studies](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-17952-001) have consistently shown the extraordinary benefits of bilingualism on children’s intellectual growth. Far from being a burden, as some might believe, learning Spanish at a young age is actually a cognitive boon!

 Bilingual children, such as those who are learning Spanish, frequently outperform their monolingual peers in numerous academic areas, including math, social studies, and reading. Their memory skills are often enhanced, with an improved ability to switch between tasks and solve problems.

 Besides, learning Spanish for kids not only boosts academic performance but also fosters a greater understanding and appreciation for different cultures. Learning Spanish from a young age gives children a global perspective, better equipping them to navigate the multicultural world in the future.

 In brief, **introducing Spanish for kids at an early age is a great investment in your kids’ future because it supports intellectual growth, enhances cognitive flexibility, and encourages cultural sensitivity.** It’s a gift that keeps on giving, benefitting them throughout their lives in many ways.

Here are a couple of things you can do to incorporate Spanish into your daily activities at home:

* Label household items in Spanish;
* Cook Spanish recipes together;
* Implement a “Spanish-only” time during the day;
* Turn simple chores into Spanish learning opportunities: for example, while setting the table, ask your kids to name the utensils and dishes in Spanish;
* Use Spanish instructions when playing a game;
* Switch between English and Spanish books for bedtime stories.

 Taking it a step further, technology can also be your ally in teaching Spanish for kids at home. **[Mondly Kids](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) , a language learning app designed for children** aged 5 to 12 years old, brings Spanish lessons for kids to life with a combination of fun and interactive features.

## Connecting with Spanish-Speaking Communities and Culture

 As you most probably know, learning Spanish for kids goes beyond than just mastering the language. If you have the possibility to do this, introduce your kids to the Spanish culture and Spanish-speaking communities. This will help them foster a greater understanding and appreciation for diverse cultures.

 Even more, you can encourage your kids to make pen-pals from [Spanish-speaking countries](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) or participate together in local Spanish cultural events.

 Connecting with Spanish-speaking communities and cultures can be an incredibly enriching and enjoyable adventure you can enjoy together with your children. The immersive experience can make learning Spanish for kids a living, breathing journey rather than just an academic exercise.

 In the end, this is not just about teaching Spanish for kids but helping your children become globally aware and culturally sensitive adults who are grateful for what they’ve become.

Now let’s look at some frequently asked questions about Spanish for kids.

### Can a 9-year-old learn Spanish?

 Yes! Starting to learn Spanish as early as 1 year old is entirely possible and beneficial. At this tender age, children are especially receptive to new sounds and patterns, making it an ideal time to introduce a second language like Spanish.

### Can a child learn Spanish by watching TV?

 Yes, a child can learn Spanish by watching TV. Television shows, cartoons and movies in Spanish can immerse children in the Spanish language. The only condition is to handpick the best shows that are non-violent and will have a benefic impact on the child’s vocabulary. To further boost the benefits of watching Spanish TV, it’s recommendable to talk about the show, repeat key phrases or discuss the storylines in Spanish.

### Can I teach my child Spanish if I’m not fluent?

 Yes, you can support their learning journey by introducing them to songs, books, cartoons, games, movies and TV shows in Spanish.

They certainly learn faster than adults because this is the age when their brains are at their most receptive, poised to absorb new information like sponges. However, every child is different. So make sure to maintain a flexible approach, allowing your child’s interest and readiness to dictate how long it takes to learn Spanish.
