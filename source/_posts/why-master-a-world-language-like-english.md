## Why English Matters Globally

 English matters globally because it has become the_lingua franca_ of the world.

 A_lingua franca,_ literally ‚ÄúFrankish tongue‚Äù, also known as a bridge language, trade language, or link language, is adopted to facilitate communication between groups of people who do not share a native language.

 This definition perfectly describes English. To address the initial question:[English](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/eng/) matters globally because it is now the most widely spoken language in the world, serving as the primary means of communication in many sectors, including business, education, science, tourism, aviation, and international diplomacy. But how did English get chosen for such an important task?

### How Did English Become So Widespread?

 The spread of the English language can largely be attributed to the British Empire, the largest empire in history. As the United Kingdom expanded its influence worldwide, English spread alongside it.

 To further add to this, the emergence of the United States as a global superpower after World War II only strengthened English‚Äôs status as a global language.

 These historical events have led to English becoming the dominant language of the internet, media, and popular culture, further cementing its role as a crucial tool for global connectivity and understanding. Its importance is not just in the number of people who speak it but also in its capacity to bring together individuals from diverse backgrounds, fostering a global community.

## Everyday Benefits of Speaking English

 The everyday benefits of speaking English are countless‚Äîtake it from the millions of people who learned English as an additional language. Wherever you are in the world, learning English is one of the best personal investments.

 Having covered the reasons to learn English and the advantages of being fluent in English, let‚Äôs dvelve into detail with some of the most important benefits of speaking English.

### Unlimited internet exploration

 For me, as someone who learned English as a second language, this is perhaps the most significant benefit. Without English, I wouldn‚Äôt have grown, learned, and certainly wouldn‚Äôt be writing this article for you.

 Do you have a household issue? Or perhaps a question about‚Ä¶ virtually anything? While finding answers in your native language might be challenging, English likely offers a solution. Don‚Äôt go as far as to google your symptoms, as you may fall into a trap, but anything else ‚Äì go for it!

### Endless content streaming & books

 Another reason why I love knowing English is being able to read any book I want. I read ‚ÄúThe Lord of the Rings‚Äù in my native language many years ago, but translation rarely does a writer true justice. I was able to fully experience the magic of Middle Earth only I finally read it in English. The same goes for ‚ÄúA Song of Ice and Fire‚Äù‚Äîreading it in English was the best decision.

 Additionally, the Pearson study mentioned earlier found that 53% of Gen Z respondents learn English to enjoy movies, shows, and online content. Streaming services might offer subtitles, but many YouTube creators do not. So, that is one more benefit of speaking English.

 For me, these three aspects are the most important benefits of speaking English. What about you? Why would you want to learn English?

### Why learn English is difficult?

 Learning English can be difficult due to its complex grammar, extensive vocabulary, and the nuances of pronunciation and spelling. English is filled with irregular verbs, idiomatic expressions, and homophones (words that sound alike but have different meanings or spellings), which can be confusing for learners. Additionally, it borrows extensively from other languages, resulting in a wide variety of phonetic sounds and spelling rules.
