## Deciding on a More Useful Foreign Language: German vs French

 Being multilingual opens up greater opportunities in various fields. Starting with your professional life and to the point where you can improve your personal life as well, learning another language offers you a valuable advantage.

 When it comes to French and German, they are both popular choices that can help you improve your knowledge, especially if you have job opportunities in one of the countries that recognize them as official languages.

If you already had the French experience by visiting Paris and other attractions, you might already be in love with the language, and you can take the next steps to improve your skills.

 If you want to move to France to study or work abroad, and you speak the language at a native proficiency level, you can easily evolve and move to a different country where French-speaking people are the majority.

## What culture do you admire the most?

 A big part of learning a new language stems from the admiration you have for one culture or another. France is the epitome of culture, art, and a bohemian lifestyle. The French view culture as an essential part of their education and place it high on their pyramid of needs.

 French is also the language of love, so not only do you require it for work or university, but also to live the greatest romance of your life. If you’re a fan of French cinema, which includes big names like Godard, Truffaut, and Rohmer, learning French will help you become an expert and understand the culture on a different level.

 Germany can offer you just as many attractions when it comes to the artistic fields. Not just a place for businesses to grow, but also for creatives to express themselves, the country has much to offer. For example, Berlin is becoming the go-to place for artists all over the world, due to its distinct approach to nightlife, cultural events, and a strong sense of self-expression.

## Where do you want to study

 Germany and France have a lot to offer in academia and are some of the most appreciated centers for international students, with a continuous rise in popularity. Germany has almost 400 universities that excel in areas such as engineering, chemistry, and physics. Some of the best academic centers in Germany are:

* Technische Universität München:
* Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin:
* Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München.

* Université PSL (Paris Sciences & Lettres);
* Ecole Polytechnique;
* Sorbonne University.

 Think about your long-term plans as well. If you want to move to either Germany, France, or other countries that speak these languages, you will have a greater chance of finding the right career if you study at one of their universities.
