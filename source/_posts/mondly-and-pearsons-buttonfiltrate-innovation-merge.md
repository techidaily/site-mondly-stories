 “Today’s acquisition marks another step in our digital strategy, giving us an exciting foothold in the fast growing direct-to-consumer English learning market and building yet more connectivity across the entire Pearson portfolio,” said Andy Bird, chief executive of Pearson.

 “Mondly is a fast growing and profitable business that expands our reach and scale in the language learning market and drives growth for the company. This acquisition is strategically important to the Group as well as being accretive and driving shareholder returns.”

 “Mondly’s mission has always been to make language learning fun, easy and accessible to everyone. We are excited to be joining forces with Pearson, the world’s leading learning company, to help us achieve our goal on a much larger scale.
