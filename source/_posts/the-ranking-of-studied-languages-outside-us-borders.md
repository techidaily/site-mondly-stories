 “Spanish flag” by Mikhail Nilov©

 It’s only natural that Spanish would come in at number one as Mexico is right next to the US. Again, unsurprising is the fact that over 50% of university students choose to study in Spanish in order to hone their language skills. Seeing as not everybody in the US is fluent in English, learning this language actually improves the chances of finding a better job in the competitive job market and allows communication with more members of one’s community.

 As the official language of 21 nations, it would be a great idea for a traveler to [start learning Spanish](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875)  as soon as possible. Since we’re on the topic of learning on the internet, you must also know that Spanish is the third most utilized language online, after English and Chinese. English speakers usually pick Spanish as their secondary language because it’s easy to learn – with only approximately 600 hours of study time required. Want to sound like a fluent speaker? Here are [17 Spanish sayings](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) that will help you achieve that!

 “Paris, Eiffel Tower” by Eugene Dorosh©

 Apparently, you’re not really a romantic if you don’t see French as the language of beauty and love. Americans seem to agree, also associating class and culture with French people. There’s no wonder then that Paris is still on top of the dream destinations for Americans traveling to Europe! Keep in mind that French is the only other language, apart from English, that is spoken on five continents. Wanna join in the fun? [Learn French online](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) !

 Back home, French is mainly spoken in Louisiana and Maine, which has to do with the history of the states. If you thought about Cajuns, you’re on the right track! Americans usually prefer to learn French in order to increase employment opportunities and enjoy the rich culture and traditions. Cajun seasoning may have something to do with their decision, but we’re not sure.

 “German flag” by Ingo Joseph©

[Why learn German](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875)  ? Well, for starters, both English and German are West Germanic languages, which means the process will be easier than if you tried to learn Romanic languages. Americans picked up on that, as German is also the second most used language in the science community, after English, of course.

 Taking into account that German is also an important business language, it’s no surprise that most of the students study German in order to work in Europe.

 Word of caution, in terms of vocabulary, German might surprise you, to say the least. There are a couple of incredibly long words that are a nightmare to pronounce. Take for example “Rechtsschutzversicherungsgesellschaften”, a word that means insurance company that provides legal protection. If that didn’t discourage you, why not [start learning German](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) ?!

 “Fiat” by Jonathan Bean©

 Again, not really a shocker since there are large communities of Italians scattered in the US, most notably in San Francisco and Boston. American gangster movies are famous for their portrayal of Italian-Americans and Italian-American culture is basically a staple of American life. Not to mention the fact that many Americans are direct descendants of Italian immigrants, so they [learn Italian](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) to communicate with nonna.

 Italian is actually one of the top ten foreign languages spoken in the US today and if you are a culinary aficionado, you already know that pizza for Americans is as traditional as apple pie. Sure, it’s not the same pizza as in Naples, but some of the best Italian Restaurants are actually found in the US.
