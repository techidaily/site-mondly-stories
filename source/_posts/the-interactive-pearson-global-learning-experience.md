## The Interactive Pearson Global Learning Experience

**After** [**joining forces with Pearson**](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875)   **earlier this year, we’re excited to share with all of you our vision of the future of language learning. Being supercharged by the world’s leading learning company allows us to accelerate our mission of making language learning fun, easy and accessible to everyone.**

 Back in May 2022, Pearson announced that it had acquired Mondly to expand its reach in the language learning market and offer a full range of ways for people to learn and prove their English skills. Today,  Mondly by Pearson is stronger, more innovative and more focused than ever.

## **Everything you love about Mondly. Supercharged.**

 While our mission at Mondly remains the same, getting together with Pearson allows us to achieve our goal on a much larger scale. We will preserve the same learning experience everyone loves as we work to enhance the process and technology behind it. The aim is to harness the power of both Mondly and Pearson to supercharge language learning.

 Here’s a video showcasing what brought us together and how we aim to help all of you make the most of the opportunities you are given.

## **Mondly by Pearson. Together.**

 Our union with Pearson brings together three essential principles: a commitment to the highest-quality educational materials, a belief in the transformative power of education, and an embedded culture of accessibility.

 Following these principles and keeping our learners at the core of everything we do, we hope to build a future in which language learning will be fun and easy for everyone. A future in which the process of learning a new language will be more individualized, and you will be able to tailor the experience to your own needs and interests. A world in which languages are a part of everyday life, and everyone is able to communicate with anyone in the world.

 Last but not least, our vision of the future is to give all of you the confidence to change your life through languages.
