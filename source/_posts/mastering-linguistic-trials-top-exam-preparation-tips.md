 Language exams or tests are structured assessments designed to measure an individual’s language proficiency. They**evaluate skills in reading, writing, listening, and speaking,** providing a comprehensive evaluation of one’s language abilities.

### Language Proficiency Scales

 Language proficiency scales help to measure how effectively a language user can perform different types of language tasks. In other words – how well you know the language.

 The most commonly used language proficiency scales are the ACTFL scale and the ILR scale for Americans, and the CEFR scale for Europeans.

* **IRL scale** (Interagency Language Roundtable scale)**:** Developed by the United States Foreign Service Institute as a reference for language proficiency in federal government roles, the ILR scale consists of five levels: elementary proficiency (S-1), limited working proficiency (S-2), professional working proficiency (S-3), full professional proficiency (S-4), and native or bilingual proficiency (S-5).
* **ACTFL scale** (American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages scale)**:** Derived from the IRL scale, it provides a more detailed assessment of language proficiency. The ACTFL scale retains the five-level structure but uses different terms: novice, intermediate, advanced, superior, and distinguished. What sets it apart is the inclusion of low, medium, and high sub-levels within the first four proficiency levels, offering a more precise evaluation of language skills.
* **CEFR scale** (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages scale)**:** The CEFR scale consists of six levels grouped into three categories: basic user (A), independent user (B), and proficient user (C). Each category is further divided into two sub-levels: A1 and A2, B1 and B2, and C1 and C2\. If your goal is to work in Europe or gain admission to a European institution that emphasizes language proficiency, the CEFR scale is the recommended framework to demonstrate your language skills.

* **Exam format and criteria:** To make an informed decision, it’s crucial to review the format, structure, and criteria of the language test to ensure it suits your strengths. Is the test computer-based, includes written or oral components, or follows a different format? Consider your comfort level with each format and choose the one that best suits your abilities. This will allow you to approach the test with confidence and perform at your best.
* **Timing and location:** Before committing to a language test, check the availability of test centers and dates in your location. Make sure you have enough time left to prepare before the date you choose.
* **Budget:** Is the test you chose within your budget? If not, consider switching to a less popular language exam. You’d be surprised to find out that some language exams offer the same benefits for less money.
* **Ask for advice:** If you’re still unsure, consider consulting with language teachers or professionals in your field who can help you make the best choice based on your specific circumstances.
