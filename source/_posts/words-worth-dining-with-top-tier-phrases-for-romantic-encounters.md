## Words Worth Dining With: Top-Tier Phrases for Romantic Encounters

 Think of it this way: if flirting is an art, then you are the artist, and the**best** **pick up lines in English** (and beyond) are your works of art_(we‚Äôre exaggerating a bit for the sake of emphasis, but bear with us)_ . Would you like your Tinder match ‚Äì or worse: your crush ‚Äì to think that the art you create is cheap? Of course not. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs crucial to choose your pick up lines carefully and not overdo it. Remember: the best pick up lines are not cringe or dirty but classy, smooth, funny, and charming. That‚Äôs the kind of English pick up lines that actually work in real life.

 Lucky for you, our list includes the**best** **pick up lines in English guaranteed to make a good first impression.** Your only job will be to put them in the right context and act them well: in a tongue-in-cheek kind of way.

[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pickup%20line) defines a**‚Äúpick up line‚Äù** as **‚Äúa prepared remark used by a person to start a conversation with a stranger they are interested in having a romantic relationship with‚Äù** . In other words, a pick up line is an icebreaker or a conversation opener. So, let‚Äôs see what are some funny pick up lines in English that can get the conversation going. Let‚Äôs go!
