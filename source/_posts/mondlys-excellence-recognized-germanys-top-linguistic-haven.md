## Mondly’s Excellence Recognized - Germany’s Top Linguistic Haven

 **We are proud to announce that Mondly was selected “Best Online Language Learning Portal” following a survey conducted by the German Institute for Service-Quality (DISQ).**

 The accolade is the result of a customer survey carried out by [the German Institute for Service-Quality (DISQ)](https://disq.de/online-portale-preis.html) for the news channel n-tv. Its goal was to determine Germany’s best online portals.

 The best providers in 45 categories were honored based on around 33,000 customer opinions that rated a total of 570 online portals.

> _The award answers the question of which portals are the best in Germany. And this decision is not made by a jury, but by the users themselves. The winners are therefore a consumer recommendation – in the best sense of the word_ , says DISQ.

 **In the [Language Learning Portal](https://disq.de/2019/20190528-Online-Portale-Preis-Lernportale-Sprachen.html) category, 18 companies were rated by customers and Mondly led the way with an overall result of 76 points.**

 The survey focused on the customers’ opinions of the respective language learning portals in the areas of offers, customer service, and websites. The sub-criteria ranged from quality and variety of the service offered, to use and speed of the portal and friendliness and competence of the customer service by telephone, e-mail, or social media.
