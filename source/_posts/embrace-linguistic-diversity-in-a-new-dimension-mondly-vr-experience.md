## Bridging the Technologies Behind Chatbots and Speech Recognition with VR

 Mondly’s conversational voice chatbot for language learning was first released by the company inAugust 2016 . The technology uses advanced speech recognition that understands millions of phrases and words in 28 different languages. Since its release, it has been used by millions of Mondly users and has learned millions of new phrases and responses, thanks to the chatbot’s self-learning technology.

 To bridge the technologies behind its chatbot, speech recognition, and VR, the company had to develop a new automatic voice detection system. Alexandru Iliescu , the CEO and co-founder of ATi Studios, spoke about the challenges involved with creating Mondly VR:

> _“The toughest challenge was to make the speech interaction feel natural in VR._
>
> _Because VR is so immersive, we quickly realized that traditional speech interaction models that require a tap or a voice command to enable speech recognition would kill the flow of the experience._
>
> _So we developed our own automatic voice detection system. It calibrates to the room’s background noise, and it ignores unintentional sounds. The result is amazing, the conversations with the virtual characters happen as naturally as real-life conversations – they just flow.”_
