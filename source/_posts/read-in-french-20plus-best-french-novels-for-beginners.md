 If you’re a**beginner eager to read in French,** it’s best to start with the first book on this list of French novels and then progressively work your way through. This approach ensures that as the texts become more complex, your French reading skills will improve accordingly. As a special highlight, the final recommendations are French classics books that everyone should read in their lifetime.

 Naturally, this list is exclusively dedicated to books originally written in French, because reading them in the original language ensures you experience the full depth and nuances, which can sometimes be lost in translation. However, if we’re talking about a very good translation, you can definitely also**read French translations of foreign books.** For instance, after you’ve tackled the first six books on our list, I highly recommend **reading_Harry Potter_ in French.** Targeted at young readers, the initial books in the series are perfectly suited for beginners.

## How to Choose the Best French Books for New Learners

**The best French novels for new learners** are ones you’ve already read. No, really. Take it from me—a language learner at heart. I perfected my English, Spanish, and French by reading books, and I strongly recommend you do the same to improve your French.

**Reading in French,** if your French is not that good,**can be challenging** at first. That’s why I always suggest starting with a book you have already read in your native language. It could be your favorite book or simply one you want to experience again. Being familiar with the story can significantly ease your first foray into reading a book in French.

 As you progress through the pages, you’ll notice a gradual increase in your familiarity with French. You’ll start to deduce the meanings of unknown words from the context and [learn French](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) in a natural way. Even better, if you read an**eBook in French** on a Kindle, you can leverage the dictionary feature to learn new words simply by tapping on them.

 After finishing, you can move on to a book you’ve never read before—in any language. However, depending on your French level, I’d suggest opting for a French novel for beginners, like_Le Petit Prince_ (The Little Prince), which is technically a novella.

 Let’s recap.**This is how to start reading in French:**

1. Read your favorite book first (or just a book you read before) as it will help you get used to reading in French;
2. Continue with a short and accessible book that uses simpler language – like _Le Petit Prince_ (The Little Prince);
3. Repeat the first two steps with different books if reading in French doesn’t feel like home yet;
4. Go on with more complex books, but don’t jump straight to French philosophy! Easy does it.

**The secret to choosing the best books to read in French** is to proceed step by step. Begin with shorter, simpler books that use straightforward language, and gradually progress to longer and more complex French books. Throughout this journey, avoid putting pressure on yourself. Reading should be enjoyable, especially when you pick genres that you love. So, make the most of your French reading experience — it will significantly benefit your French studies!

However, if you want to learn to read French, it’s important to approach it step by step. If you’re just starting out, avoid diving straight into the complex works of Émile Zola or Jean-Paul Sartre. Instead, start with more accessible authors like Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and Victor Hugo. You might not be ready to tackle the**greatest French novels** from day one, but with enough work and patience, you’ll eventually get there.

 My number one rule for reading in French as a beginner is simple: read what you love. If that means diving into**French romance novels,** then embrace it! When you’re starting to read in French, there’s no such thing as a ‘bad’ book genre.

 Think about the types of books you enjoy in your native language. If history books aren’t your thing in English, chances are you won’t suddenly find a passion for them in French.

 Let’s be honest—everyone enjoys a captivating romance novel now and then. The fact that it’s in French only adds to the charm, making it a delightful bonus on your journey to learning French!

Simply tap on it to see its definition instantly.

 Fortunately, Project Gutenberg offers hundreds of free French eBooks, so be sure to explore their collection. You will also find some of the books we recommended.

Before you go, make sure to check out these FAQs.

### How can reading French books benefit language learning?

 Reading French books offers a multidimensional approach to language learning, immersing readers in the linguistic rhythms, vocabulary, and cultural nuances of the French language. This method not only enhances reading comprehension and vocabulary acquisition but also exposes learners to various grammatical structures and idiomatic expressions in context, promoting a deeper understanding of the language.

### Can short stories help beginners in French reading?

 Yes, short stories are highly beneficial for beginners in French reading. They offer a manageable and engaging way to immerse oneself in the language without the overwhelming commitment required by longer French novels. Short stories provide exposure to diverse vocabulary, grammar, and cultural contexts within a concise format, making it easier for learners to grasp the nuances of French language and storytelling. This format allows for quick comprehension checks and the satisfaction of completing a narrative in a shorter period, encouraging continued reading and practice.

### Are there any free resources for French eBooks and audiobooks?

 Yes, there are excellent free resources available for those looking to access French eBooks and audiobooks. Project Gutenberg’s French eBook Collection is a treasure trove of French literature, offering a wide range of classic texts in French that are freely available to the public. Similarly, Librivox offers a fantastic selection of French audiobooks for free, allowing learners to listen to French literature narrated by volunteers.

 In conclusion, diving into French reading as a beginner might seem daunting at first, but with the right approach and resources, it can become the best part of your French learning journey. Starting with familiar stories or genres you love, progressing through a thoughtfully curated list of French novels that gradually increase in complexity, and making use of eBooks, are all strategies that will not only enhance your French vocabulary but also to deepen your appreciation for the language’s literary heritage.
