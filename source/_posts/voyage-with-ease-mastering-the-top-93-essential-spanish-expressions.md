## 1\. Greetings and other basic phrases – the magic Spanish words

 If you want to spark some Spanish conversations, it takes just a common Spanish word to do it: a greeting. And you probably know one already. The Latins are warm, friendly and very welcoming people, so don’t be surprised if they seem open to conversation. It’s an opportunity you want to take advantage of.

* _¡Buenos días!_ – Good morning!
* _¡Buenas tardes!_ – Good afternoon!
* _¡Buenas noches!_ – Good evening!
* _¡Hola!_ – Hi!
