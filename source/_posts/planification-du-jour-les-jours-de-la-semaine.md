## Planification Du Jour: Les Jours De La Semaine

 Mastering something as essential as the**days of the week in French** may prove more practical than you think. Paris is always a good idea, but what if you miss your_mardi_ reservation at the #1 restaurant in Paris because you show up on_mercredi_ instead? We don’t want that to happen. That’s why it’s always best to dive into [learning French](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) by mastering the essentials first: how to say “[hello](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) ”, “[you’re welcome](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) ” and the days of the week.

 Easy enough, aren’t they? If you are not completely sure about the pronunciation, here’s how you’d pronounce them in English:

* _lundi_  – “lun-dee”
* _mardi_  – “mar-dee”
* _mercredi_  – “mare-creu-dee”
* _jeudi_  – “zheu-dee”
* _vendredi_  – “von-dre-dee”
* _samedi_  – “sum-dee”
* _dimanche_  – “dee-monsh”

 Now repeat them a few times to make sure they stick and let’s move on to some context. Here are some useful French expressions related to time and the days of the week:

* _un jour_ – a day
* _aujourd’hui_ – today
* _hier_  – yesterday
* _avant-hier_ – the day before yesterday
* _demain_ – tomorrow
* _après-demain_ – the day after tomorrow
* _Quel jour est-ce ?_ – What day is it?
* _Quel jour tombe ton anniversaire cette année ?_ – What day is your birthday this year?
* _On peut aller au restaurant jeudi._ – We could go to the restaurant on Thursday.
* _Je ne travaille pas le vendredi._ – I don’t work on Fridays.
* _hebdomadaire_ – weekly
* _dans trois jours_ – in three days time
* _le week-end_ – the weekend
* _jours ouvrables_ – working days (Monday to Friday)
* _du lundi au vendredi_ – from Monday to Friday
* _Le mardi est le deuxième jour de la semaine._ – Tuesday is the second day of the week.

## Usage rules

 One more thing before you go. To make sure you are using your newly acquired French days of the week correctly, don’t forget that:

* **the days of the week are not capitalized in French** – unless, of course, they appear at the beginning of a sentence;
* **the French week starts on Monday;**
* **days of the week are all masculine in French** – this means you’ll always have to use masculine articles _(le_ and _un)_  and masculine adjectives when talking about the days of the week. For example, if you want to say “the last Friday of the month was rainy” in French, you say _“le dernier vendredi du mois était pluvieux”;_
* in contrast to _le jour_ , [_la journée_](https://french.kwiziq.com/revision/grammar/when-to-use-an-annee-matin-matinee-jour-journee-soir-soiree-time-unit-vs-duration) (which also translates to “day”) is a feminine noun that refers to a longer period of time during which something might happen. _Jour,_ on the other hand, represents a precise moment, a unit of time. For example: “_Je te rendrai visite dans la journée”_ (“I’ll visit you during the day”) is different from _“Je t’appelle dans deux jours”_ (“I’ll call you in two days”).
