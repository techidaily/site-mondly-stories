## Unveiling the Mystery of English Language Contractions and Their Usage

 English contractions are the perfect way to sound more natural and save time when speaking. Essentially, contractions glue two or more words together and replace certain middle letters in the given union with an apostrophe. This is how phrases like_how did_ or_I would_ become shortened to_how’d_ and_I’d_ . Quite the letter economy, right?

 Contraction words are generally easy enough to sort out, but there are situations where they can get tricky. For all those situations, it’s necessary to keep an eye out for rules. That’s why**we are** – or let’s say_**we’re**_ – going to explain everything you need to know about the rules of contractions in English. And while we’re at it, we will also add a contraction word list to go perfectly with the explanations.



## What is a contraction?

**A contraction is** a type of abbreviation formed by combining two or more words and dropping one or more letters. In writing, the missing letters are replaced by an apostrophe. Sometimes called ‘short forms’, English contractions usually join a subject pronoun and a verb, an interrogative adverb and a verb, or a verb and the word_not_ .

 Contraction words typically appear in colloquial speech, written dialogue, and other informal pieces of writing like text messages, blogs, or social media posts. Taking up less space also makes them perfect for advertising.

 The main advantage of contractions in English is that they save time in both writing and speaking. Besides, their informal nature gives your discourse a more friendly, accessible, and approachable tone.

 Careful, though! It’s**best to avoid contractions in highly formal contexts,** like academic papers, grant proposals, formal speeches, or any materials requiring a professional appearance.

## Understanding English contractions

 Contractions are an essential part of the English language. For this reason, it’s important to understand and use them correctly. Let’s look at a couple of examples so you can better understand what we’re talking about.

### Types of English contractions

* **Subject pronoun + verb:** This is the most common type of contraction in English. For example:_I am_ becomes_I’m_ ,_you are_ becomes_you’re_ ,_he is_ becomes_he’s_ , and so on.
* **Interrogative adverbs:** Interrogative adverbs like_what_ ,_where_ ,_when_ ,_how_ , and_why_ can also be contracted when combined with auxiliary verbs. For instance,_where have_ can be contracted to_where’ve_ ,_when will_ to_when’ll_ ,_how is_ to_how’s_ , and_why did_ to_why’d_ .
* **Verb + ‘not’:** Contractions can also form when combining a verb with the word_not_ . For example,_do not_ becomes_don’t_ ,_is not_ becomes_isn’t_ ,_will not_ becomes_won’t_ , and_can not_ becomes_can’t_ .
* **Informal contractions:** Informal contractions are speech contractions that mirror the way a contracted word is pronounced. For example, the informal contraction for_you_ and_all_ is_y’all_ (popular in some parts of the United States). Another example is_gonna_ , which combines_going_ and_to_ .

 **Despite the fact that they stand for multiple words, contractions act as single words.** Furthermore, they have definitive spellings and cannot be formed arbitrarily.

 One of the trickiest parts of English contractions is that some of them have the same spelling but different meanings, e.g.,_I’d_ can mean_I would_ or_I had._

 Couldn’t  Couldn’t9 (52.94 %)

 They’d  They’d5 (29.41 %)

 We’ve  We’ve1 (5.88 %)

**Fun fact:** Did you know that_o’clock_ is the contraction word for_of the clock_ ? In this particular case, the contraction is more popular than the actual phrase and it’s considered fine to use even in formal writing.

## Grammar rules for English contractions

 Before you go thinking you know everything about contractions, we must look over some rules for contractions grammar.

1. **Contractions vs. possessive nouns:** Apostrophes are common in both contractions and possessive nouns, so it’s easy to confuse them. To figure out which one is which, you can look at the context. For example: “Cindy’s doll is nice” (meaning “the doll of Cindy is nice”) versus “Cindy’s ready for dinner” (meaning “Cindy is ready for dinner”). Laying them out like this makes it easier to figure out that the first_‘s_ represents a possessive noun.
2. **Contractions vs. possessive pronouns:** _It’s_ or_its_ ?_They’re_ or_their_ ? Which one should you use? Again, context helps a lot. Moreover, it’s important to remember that possessive pronouns do not use apostrophes.
3. **Double contractions in writing:** Take a look at this double contraction:_mustn’t’ve_ . It’s the shortened form of_must not have_ . Kinda hard to read, right? Well, that’s because you should**avoid using double contractions in writing.** Go ahead and use them in casual conversations, but avoid them in writing (even in colloquial writing) as they look awkward and are hard to read.
4. **Some contractions are regional:** Like [slang words](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) , some English contractions are used only in certain regions or cultures. For example,_y’all_ and_ain’t_ are only used in some parts of the United States. So, technically, not everyone is familiar with them, which means you shouldn’t use them extensively.
5. **Negative contractions and tag questions go together like English speakers and [misspelled words](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) :** A tag question is a short question added at the end of a sentence to turn it into a question. They are used to confirm information or engage the listener in the conversation. For example: “You’re coming to the party, aren’t you?”. When the declarative part of the sentence is affirmative, the question part is formulated as negative and conversely. If the tag question is negative, it’s your cue to use a contraction.

## Contractions in writing and their importance

 If you write in English on a daily basis, you probably use contractions quite a lot. And that’s perfectly fine if you talk to your family or friends. English contractions save time and space and make your daily communications sound friendlier.

 On the other hand, professors and employers, for example, like to see that you’ve taken your time writing a document and didn’t use ‘shortcuts’. Besides, giving up contractions on a school paper will work in your favor if you need to up that word count!

 Therefore, the rule of thumb for anything formal is to**limit the use of contractions in writing.** An ideal situation would involve you knowing the other person’s expectations. But if you do not, it is best to shy away from using contractions, just like I did with this sentence.

 However, if what you’re writing is semi-formal, you can use a couple of very popular contractions. The only condition is to not forget about the apostrophe, as the entire text will look unprofessional.
