## Transforming Language Education Through Mondly's AR Platform

**September 7, 2017, Brasov Romania** –  ATi Studios, creators of [Mondly](https://adjt.mondly.com/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-710&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com%3Futm%5Fmedium%3Dblog%5Fblog-post-id-710%26utm%5Fsource%3Dblog-post-id-710&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com%3Futm%5Fmedium%3Dblog%5Fblog-post-id-710%26utm%5Fsource%3Dblog-post-id-710&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages%3Futm%5Fmedium%3Dblog%5Fblog-post-id-710%26utm%5Fsource%3Dblog-post-id-710&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fapple-store%2Fid987873536%3Fpt%3D78954800%26ct%3Dblog-post-id-710%26mt%3D8) , the language app with over 20 million downloads and recently crowned 2017 Facebook “App of the Year” in EMEA, launches Mondly VR, a first-of-its-kind language experience for Google’s Virtual Reality platforms Daydream and Cardboard.

 Mondly VR allows people to take part in conversations with virtual characters in 30 different languages by combining voice chatbot, speech recognition, and VR technology. The app offers instant immersion, feedback on pronunciation, suggestions that enrich learners’ vocabulary, and interactive scenarios that make learning languages fun and easy.

Check out this fun, short video:

 Alex Iliescu, CEO of Mondly, spoke recently about why Mondly identified VR early-on as the future of language learning: “   _We realized the best way to teach languages would be to create an immersive experience that replicates real-life scenarios and conversations. VR gives us the best opportunity to do this.”_

Alex continues   _“From our experience, the biggest things that keep people from actually speaking and using new languages are fear and lack of life-like practice. Mondly VR overcomes these barriers and quickly gets learners comfortable and speaking in real-life situations. We’re filling the conversational gap of traditional language education._ ”

 Before Mondly VR, to experience language immersion – it typically required months of preparation, then travel. Today, it requires Mondly VR and a VR headset.

## Experts agree that IMMERSION is the best way to learn a new language

In one [study](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/science/how-immersion-helps-to-learn-a-new-language.html?mcubz=1)  , featured in the New York Times by Michael Ullman, a neuroscientist at Georgetown University Medical Center, language learning subjects were split into two groups. One group studied language in a formal classroom setting, while the other was taught through immersion. After five months, both groups retained the language. However, the group that learned a new language through immersion displayed the full brain patterns of a native speaker.
