## First Steps in German: Tongue Training & Symbol Recognition

 Many people assume that German pronunciation is difficult. Some of them would even want to [learn German](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) but donâ€™t do it because they find it too intimidating. And we canâ€™t blame them. The internet is loaded with videos of people exaggerating the German pronunciation.

 However, German pronunciation being difficult is just a myth._Oh ja,_ you read that right. German is actually one of the few languages where pronunciation makes sense. Once you know the rules, all you have to do is flex those pronunciation muscles and speak like a true German. Itâ€™s really not as hard as you think. Letâ€™s break the myth together.

## The basics of the German alphabet

 Weâ€™ll naturally start with the basics. Much like English, the German alphabet consists of 26 standard letters. In addition to that, it also features the letter ÃŸ â€“ known as the German ligature â€“ and umlauted forms of three vowels: Ã¤, Ã¶ and Ã¼. In total,_das Alphabet_ has 8 vowels and 22 consonants.

 Considering youâ€™re already familiar with all the other letters, letâ€™s continue by taking a closer look at these four special letters: ÃŸ, Ã¤, Ã¶ and Ã¼.

### ÃŸ also known as â€˜sharp Sâ€™, â€˜eszettâ€™ or â€˜scharfes Sâ€™

 Although it looks different from everything youâ€™ve ever seen in English, ÃŸ shouldnâ€™t intimidate you. Vaguely resembling a capital â€˜Bâ€™,**the letter ÃŸ is pronounced like a sharp S** (like the â€˜sâ€™ in â€˜seeâ€™) â€“ hence its name â€˜eszettâ€™ or â€˜scharfes Sâ€™.

 German is the only language that uses ÃŸ and if the character is unavailable, it can be replaced with âŸ¨ssâŸ©. In fact, in Swiss Standard German (used in Switzerland and Liechtenstein), the letter was completed replaced by âŸ¨ssâŸ© sometime in the 20th century.

 Eszett not having a capitalized version sparked debates for a long time, so the Council for German Orthography [officially adopted](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/bildung/rechtschreibung-das-alphabet-bekommt-einen-neuen-buchstaben-1.3566309) a capital in 2017\. The capital of ÃŸ is áºž.

### German umlauts: Ã¤, Ã¶, Ã¼

 While highly representative for the German language, the German umlauts are â€˜guiltyâ€™ of making the most uncommon sounds to English speakers.

 To put it simply, the umlaut â€“ represented by the two dots over a, o and u â€“ indicates that an â€˜hidden eâ€™ will follow the vowel in pronunciation:

* **Ã¤** will be pronounced as **â€˜aeâ€™** ;
* **Ã¶** will be pronounced as **â€˜oeâ€™** ;
* **Ã¼** will be pronounced as **â€˜ueâ€™** .

 To give you a better idea of the pronunciation, remember that Ã¤ somehow resembles the â€˜aiâ€™ sound in â€˜airâ€™ and Ã¶ is similar to the â€˜eâ€™ in â€˜herâ€™ or the famous French â€˜euâ€™. With Ã¼ things are a little bit easier, because thanks to MÃ¼ller, you probably already know how to pronounce Ã¼.

Now round off your lips and start practicing!

## German pronunciation guide for single letters

 Now that weâ€™ve settled the matters with ÃŸ, Ã¤, Ã¶ and Ã¼, itâ€™s time to move on to more familiar letters and see how their pronunciation differs from English.

 Because this is a beginnerâ€™s guide on German pronunciation, we wonâ€™t overwhelm you with diphthongs or other such â€˜scaryâ€™ things that might steal your focus. Weâ€™ll continue by just simply explaining how to pronounce single letters or certain letter combinations.

 Sounds good? Letâ€™s dive right in. Hereâ€™s how to pronounce the German letters that sound different from English:

1. **R** â€“ Much like the notorious French _r_ , the German _r_ is one of the most distinctive sounds of the language. Many people describe its pronunciation like a gurgling sound. However, this is applicable only for the _R_ s placed at the beginning of a word. Anywhere else, the _r_  sounds more like an â€˜ahâ€™ or â€˜uhâ€™. Now try to say _Radio_ like a German.
2. **W** â€“ The German _w_ sounds like the English â€˜vâ€™. Now you know _vy some Germans vill talk like zis._  Try it yourself by saying _was?_ (â€˜what?â€™).
3. **V** â€“ Sounds like the English â€˜fâ€™. This is why _Vater_ sounds a lot like â€˜fatherâ€™.
4. **J** â€“ _Oh ja,_ you already know this one! The German _j_ is pronounced like the English â€˜yâ€™.
5. **E** â€“ If you see an _e_ at the end of a German word, make sure to pronounce it like this: â€˜ehâ€™. Come on! Loud and clear: _Katze_ (â€˜catâ€™)!

## German pronunciation guide for letter combinations

 Just a few more examples and youâ€™ll soon be ready to speak like a German! Letâ€™s see how you should pronounce certain letter combinations in German:

1. **CH** â€“ Donâ€™t laugh, but this is best described as a cat-hissing sound. Now try saying _Ich_ (â€˜Iâ€™) or _mich_ (â€˜myâ€™). However, donâ€™t forget that the sound is usually softer after a consonant.
2. **EI** â€“ Sounds a lot like the English â€˜eyeâ€™. Try it by saying _einladen_ (â€˜to inviteâ€™).
3. **IE**  â€“ You should pronounce this one like a long â€˜eâ€™: _lieben_ (â€˜to loveâ€™).
4. **PF** â€“ Make sure to quickly pronounce both letters as close together as possible. For example: _Pfeffer_ (â€˜pepperâ€™).
5. **SP/ST** â€“ In both cases you should say _sh_  (exactly like the English â€˜shâ€™) followed by _p_ or _t_ . Thus, _sp_ will be pronounced _shp_ and _st_ will be pronounced _sht_ . For example:_sprechen_ (â€˜speakâ€™) or Strauss as in musician Johann Strauss.
6. **KN** â€“ Although it may sound weird to you as an English speaker, make sure to pronounce both letters: _Knabe_ (â€˜boyâ€™ or â€˜ladâ€™).
7. **TH** â€“ Sounds like â€˜tâ€™. Practice by saying _Theorie_ like this: TAY-oh-ree.
8. **TSCH** â€“ You already know this one becauseâ€¦ _Deutsch_ . As you can see, it is similar to the â€˜châ€™ in â€˜couchâ€™ or â€˜checkâ€™.
9. **EU** â€“ Sounds like â€˜oyâ€™ in English.
10. **Z** â€“ Donâ€™t pronounce this like the English â€˜zâ€™. Go instead for the â€˜tsâ€™ sound in â€˜catsâ€™. Try it: _Zeitung_ (â€˜newspaperâ€™).

 Did you recognize_ze rules_ in this example?

## How to pronounce long German words

_Ja,_ the German language is famous for its very long words, but once again â€“ this shouldnâ€™t intimidate you. Most [German words](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) are, in fact, compounds.

 So what exactly is a â€˜compoundâ€™? When two words (or sometimes even more) are used together to create a new meaning, a compound is formed. In English, we use hyphens to make everything easier to read, but German just puts everything tight together._Gute Arbeit, Deutsch!_ (â€˜Nice work, German!â€™) For example,_unabhÃ¤ngigkeitserklÃ¤rungen_ translates to â€˜declarations of independenceâ€™ and_nahrungsmittelunvertrÃ¤glichkeit_ may look impossible to remember or pronounce, but it actually means â€˜food intoleranceâ€™.

 Now, everything you have to do to successfully pronounce these long words is to mentally separate the compound word. Break up the very long word into shorter words and pronounce them using the rules you already know. You may sound funny in the beginning, but in time, it will get easier and easier to recognize and pronounce long German words.

_TschÃ¼ss!_
