## Making Languid Latin Lessons a Blast

 Going back to school may not be the same this year, but one thing stays the same: the “ordeal” most students have to go through to [learn Latin](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5440&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5440?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=la&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5440?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=la) . But this can change. Whether you are a student who’s been struggling with Latin for a while now or even a teacher trying to make Latin fun in the classroom, I have good news: **Latin made a comeback and is now super trendy, fun and easy to learn for students of all ages!**

 I know you are excited. I am too. “How is this even possible?” – you’ll ask. Well, here’s a hint: brilliant minds invented very cool and immensely useful pieces of software called “language learning apps” that can make language learning fun. The problem is that most language learning apps ignore Latin. But not this one. This [language learning app](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5440&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5440?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=la&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5440?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=la) will change the way we learn Latin forever. Read on to find out more and you won’t be disappointed.

## How I learned Latin like a pro (and how you can too!)

 I know your pain. I’ve been there too. I hated Latin when I was in high school. I could not see the point of learning a dead language.

 But then, in the 12th grade, our teacher retired and another young and dedicated Latin teacher replaced her. It was, of course, too late for me to become fluent in Latin in just one semester. But I learned a few things.

 First of all, I learned that I did not hate Latin. I later found out I was actually fascinated by it, but the previous teacher did not know how to properly teach and instil passion in me or my colleagues.

 Second of all, I also learned that Latin is not a dead language. On the contrary! Latin is very much alive in our everyday conversations._Carpe diem!_

 Finally, in addition to some actual Latin words, expressions and verb conjugations, I also learned that I should give Latin a second chance.

 And I did. Seven years later. Or better said – a few months ago when [**Mondly introduced a new Latin course**](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) that allowed me to enjoy learning Latin and even**speak Latin like a total pro.**

Here’s how.

## Veni, vidi, vici

 “I came; I saw; I conquered” – that’s exactly what happened when I started learning Latin with Mondly. And you know what? It took me about 5 minutes to fall in love with Latin in Mondly. It’s so fun it becomes addictive! I now get Julius Caesar and how good it feels to win and finally achieve a goal that seemed impossible a few years ago.

 Lucky for you, language learning app Mondly is available to [download](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5440&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5440?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=la&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5440?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=la) today, right now. You won’t have to wait for years to make Latin fun in the classroom or at home.
