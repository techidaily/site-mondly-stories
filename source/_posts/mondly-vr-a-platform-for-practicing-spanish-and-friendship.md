## About Mondly VR

[Mondly VR](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) is a language learning app based in virtual reality for Daydream and Cardboard VR compatible devices. It currently provides users with 30 different languages ranging from those more commonly learned (like [English, Japanese, Farsi](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) , Mandarin, and Spanish) to languages usually only studied by native speakers and linguistics aficionados (like Finnish and Hungarian). 14 of the available learning choices in Mondly VR rank among the hardest for native English speakers to learn.  
 Mondly VR allows users to have conversations with a chatbot represented by a variety of digital characters which ask you questions in the target language according to the selected environment: train, restaurant, hotel’s reception, hotel room, and taxi.

 By combining voice chatbot, speech recognition, and VR technology, Mondly VR offers instant immersion, feedback on pronunciation, suggestions that enrich learners’ vocabulary, and interactive scenarios that make language learning fun and incredibly easy.
