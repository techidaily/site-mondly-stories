## Tejor De Sonidos: Cómo Decir Colores

 Roses are indeed red, but violets are actually violet. That’s why it’s important to learn the**colors in Spanish** before (almost) anything else.

 Color is omnipresent in our lives. From the very first moment we become aware of our surroundings, color stimulates our senses. Our mother’s blue eyes comfort us, the yellow banana makes us drool, the red toy car brings excitement and the green veggies are “healthy but disgusting”. Naturally, colors are some of the first words we learn, not just in our native language but in any language. Learning to say the colors in Spanish is also an important first step in [learning basic Spanish words](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) . So, let’s dive right in and learn how to say **_red, blue, green,_ and** **_more_ in Spanish** .

## The colors in Spanish

 Spanish colors are easy enough to remember. At least most of them. Why “most”? Because ‘orange’ in Spanish always seems to be problematic.

 If you are talking about both the color and the fruit,[**Real Academia Española**](https://www.rae.es/) states that ‘o_range’_ in Spanish is ‘naranja’. ‘Anaranjado’, on the other hand, refers to something that is ‘orange-colored’ or ‘oranged’ (if such a word would exist).

 “Blue orange” by davisuko©

 Now, there are some people who argue that technically, ‘anaranjado’ is the name of the color and ‘naranja’ is the name of the fruit, but that shouldn’t worry you since Real Academia Española gave the green light to ‘naranja’ to be used for both. After all, RAE is the authority when it comes to linguistic regularization in the Spanish-speaking world.

 That being said, the**12 most important colors in Spanish are:**

* **red — _rojo_**
* **pink — _rosa_**
* **orange — _naranja_**
* **yellow — _amarillo_**
* **green — _verde_**
* **blue — _azul_**
* **brown — _marrón_**
* **violet — _violeta_**
* **purple —_morado / púrpura_**
* **cyan —_cian_**
* **turquoise —_turquesa_**
* **grey — _gris_**
* **white — _blanco_**
* **black — _negro_**

 Don’t forget that the colors in Spanish are most of the time used as adjectives. Therefore, they must agree with the gender and number of the noun they are determining. For example, ‘red’ in Spanish will be ‘roja’ if you are talking about **_u_ _na chaqueta que es roja_**  (“a jacket that is red”), which is a feminine noun.

 The pronunciation of most of these color names can prove to be really tricky if you don’t have the audio handy. Luckily, you can always play this short video to see how the fluent speakers do it in a quick lesson from Mondly:
