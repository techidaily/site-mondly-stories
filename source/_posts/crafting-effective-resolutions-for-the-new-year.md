## Crafting Effective Resolutions for the New Year

 A new year is a wonderful time to set goals, which is why new year’s resolutions are so popular. As the new year approaches, think about what you would like to change for yourself. If you’re stuck for ideas, you might draw some inspiration from some of the most popular new year’s resolutions.

## Popular New Year’s Resolutions for 2018: Change Your Life for the Better

### 1.Travel

 Most people would like to see more of the world, but this life goal usually falls on the back burner when other priorities get in the way. If you’ve been delaying the trip of your dreams, remember that life is short. Travel takes investment, but it creates memories that last a lifetime.

 Travel can help you accomplish other goals as well. If you’re interested in learning foreign languages, traveling to an area your chosen language is spoken will help you pick up on things faster. There is a big difference between practicing a language on your own and being immersed in a culture where it’s commonly used. It’s also possible that your time spent in other countries will inspire you to continue learning foreign languages when you get back home.

### 2\. Move in a New Career Direction

 Maybe you’ve been dreaming of escaping your job and pursuing something you’ve always dreamed of doing. If so, this is your year! However, before you make your big move, it’s important to ensure you’re ready. If it’s been years since you’ve [spruced up your resume](https://www.europelanguagejobs.com/) , now is the time to work on your skillset so you can attract future employers.

 If you’re not already bilingual, learning a second language is an ideal way to improve your chances in the job market. Keep in mind that you don’t necessarily have to become fluent in the language before you can begin using your skills to sell yourself. For example, even a moderate understanding of Spanish could make you a valuable asset in an area where a portion of the population is Hispanic.

### 3\. Improve Focus and Concentration

 The struggle to focus is becoming more common as the average person continues to be bombarded with more and more noise from social media, phones and mainstream television. Resolving to spend less time on social media is a good move, but committing to the greater goal of improving your focus and mind power overall will serve you for the rest of your life.

 Aside from getting enough exercise, reading, eating well and taking healthy supplements, learning a language is an awesome way to improve focus and concentration while simultaneously expanding your horizons. Both the addition of the language itself and the process of learning can help your brain function better. Some [studies](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/12156709/Students-should-learn-second-language-to-prevent-dementia-in-later-life.html)  have even shown that the multilingual tend to develop dementia later in life than those who only speak one language.

### 4\. Get in Shape

 Becoming physically fit is another common resolution for the new year. Everyone wants to be fit, but far too many people give up during the first stages of the process. If you’re out of shape, working out won’t feel wonderful in the beginning. When things get rough, know that they will eventually improve. After a certain point, a workout provides an amazing endorphin rush. By then, you’ll likely be seeing major improvements in your body as well. The key is continuing until you make it to that stage.

 One of the best things about getting fit is that you can practice your other resolutions at the same time. Many of the resolutions on this list can be worked on while you run on a treadmill or ride an exercise bike. If reading more is a goal, bring a book along to the gym. If you’re working on learning a language, you can use your learning app to listen to phrases or even practice speaking as you exercise.

### 5\. Read More

 Reading is a wonderful activity that expands the mind, increases vocabulary and provides an escape from stress. Unfortunately, far too many people are missing out on the benefits of reading books. Reading involves setting down the phone and tuning out the world, which can be difficult for those who are constantly busying themselves on social media. If this is something you have struggled with in the past, know that you can change. All it takes is realizing the importance of reading and then setting aside time for it.

 If language learning is another one of your resolutions, you’ll be glad to know the two go hand in hand. Every year, many books are published in languages other than English. Learning foreign languages will give you access to authors and stories you never would have discovered otherwise.

### 6\. Learn Something New on Your Own

 Maybe you’ve already accomplished a lot of the typical resolutions. You’ve been exercising for years, you eat healthy food, and you already have the career of your dreams. If this sounds like you, maybe your only goal this year is to learn something new.

Attempting to learn a language  is an excellent goal for an impressive achiever like yourself. It’s difficult enough to provide a fun challenge but doable enough to be accomplished in your spare time. As we already mentioned, not only will language learning compliment most other common resolutions, but you can also practice it at the same time.

## Sticking to the Plan: Maintaining Motivation as You Move Through the Year

 It’s common knowledge that most people don’t follow through with their resolutions. Over [72 percent](https://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/)  of people maintain their resolutions throughout the first week of the new year, but only 44.8 percent make it beyond the first six months.

 It isn’t hard to understand why this is the case. Life is busy, stressful and full of other obligations. If you want to avoid another cycle of failing to meet your goals for the new year, you’ll need a plan to help you stay motivated.

**1\. Avoid Extremes**

 When setting a schedule to meet your goals, avoid being too strict on yourself. Whether you’ll be getting in shape, going on a diet or learning a language, you need to pace yourself. Attempting to speed up the process beyond what your body or mind is capable of will lead to frustration and burnout. Instead, set small, achievable goals that will allow you to feel good about yourself every time you accomplish them. That’s how you’ll continually fuel motivation.

**2\. Track Your Progress**

 Every time you accomplish one of your goals, write it down. Share it on social media. Tell your friends. Do whatever is necessary to make note of it. That way, the next time you’re feeling weak or discouraged, you can look back at your notes and remember that you are getting somewhere.

**3\. Create Lifelong Habits, Not Short-term Illusions**

 People tend to think in absolutes when it comes to resolutions. They either succeed or fail, and if they fail, most people tend to give up and forget about the goal until the following year. If you’ve done this before, and you want to make a real change this year, you’ll want to approach the process differently.

 Diets usually fail because they aren’t sustainable. The same goes for intense exercise regimens or even study regimens. For instance, deciding to learn a language is wonderful, but setting a schedule that requires hours of practice every night of the week will lead to failure. No one can commit to something every single night. You have obligations to family, your partner and your career. You also need to relax at times.

 Instead of setting a strict schedule, commit to something more reasonable. Set out to create new habits that will integrate into your everyday life instead of standing apart from it. You want to eat healthier, not follow a diet. You want to learn, practice and use a language, not simply study it. Switching your focus on creating new habits versus maintaining a new year’s resolution will do wonders for your mindset.

 If you’re ready to take the first steps toward a better life, there’s no reason to wait until the new year. With a variety of language apps available online, you can get started today. Language learning is cumulative, so the sooner you begin practicing, the sooner you’ll be impressing your friends with your new skills.
