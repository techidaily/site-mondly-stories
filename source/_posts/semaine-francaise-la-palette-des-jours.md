## Usage rules

 One more thing before you go. To make sure you are using your newly acquired French days of the week correctly, don’t forget that:

* **the days of the week are not capitalized in French** – unless, of course, they appear at the beginning of a sentence;
* **the French week starts on Monday;**
* **days of the week are all masculine in French** – this means you’ll always have to use masculine articles _(le_ and _un)_  and masculine adjectives when talking about the days of the week. For example, if you want to say “the last Friday of the month was rainy” in French, you say _“le dernier vendredi du mois était pluvieux”;_
* in contrast to _le jour_ , [_la journée_](https://french.kwiziq.com/revision/grammar/when-to-use-an-annee-matin-matinee-jour-journee-soir-soiree-time-unit-vs-duration) (which also translates to “day”) is a feminine noun that refers to a longer period of time during which something might happen. _Jour,_ on the other hand, represents a precise moment, a unit of time. For example: “_Je te rendrai visite dans la journée”_ (“I’ll visit you during the day”) is different from _“Je t’appelle dans deux jours”_ (“I’ll call you in two days”).
