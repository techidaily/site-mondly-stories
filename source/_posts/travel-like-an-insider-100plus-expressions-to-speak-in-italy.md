## 1\. Italian greetings and courtesy phrases

[Italian greetings](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) should always be on top of your list of priorities when packing your bags for a trip to Italy. The Italian culture places a big emphasis on greetings, introductions, and respect towards the elders. Do you remember [_Il Padrino_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/) (“The Godfather”)? Well, that scenario wasn’t entirely fictitious. In many cultures around the world,_gli anziani della famiglia_ (“the elders of the family”) are regarded as wise heads of the family responsible for taking the most important decisions. So here are the most important**Italian greetings** you should know as a traveler:

* Good morning! –_Buongiorno!_

* Good evening! –_Buonasera!_
* Good night! –_Buonanotte!_
