## Celebrating a Decade & Half of Free Lessons

 Today, we are thrilled to announce a new milestone: 1500 free daily lessons in 33 languages! Thank you for being a part of our story! No matter if you have joined Mondly from the beginning or just now.

## 1500 daily lessons – thousands of hours of content

 If you never had premium, now would be the perfect time to get it because our new milestone marks thousands of hours of self-study material on over 40 topics such as travel, romance, fun or business. As a premium Mondly user you’ll get full access to all the 1500 daily lessons, 215 weekly quizzes and 50 monthly challenges we created for you since 2015 until now.

## What is a daily lesson?

 The free daily lesson was (and still is) the most popular feature among the Mondly learners since the beginning. Compact and very entertaining, its aim is to enable you to beef up your knowledge every day for at least 5 minutes. Just set the desired time to learn and we will send you a friendly reminder every single day.

 To make the learning process more enjoyable for you, each Mondly daily lesson is a gamified experience: you swipe up and down, select the right answer, arrange letters into words and words into sentences, use your voice to repeat the correct pronunciation of certain words and earn points for every completed lesson. If you are motivated by having competition, do all the lessons and let the points decide your place in the national and international leaderboards.

## Why are they called “free daily lessons”?

 Each daily lesson is only free for one day: the day it becomes available inside the app. After that, it becomes accessible only with a Mondly premium account.

## Why Mondly?

 With over 40 million downloads worldwide and an average rating of 4.7 out of 5 from over 1,000,000 reviews, Mondly is one of the most innovative language learning platforms in the world. Its many achievements – including 3 world premieres – have been endorsed by influential media companies like Forbes, CNN, Inc., Bloomberg, Gartner, and many others.

 Apart from the daily lessons, weekly quizzes, and monthly challenges, Mondly also offers 40 clear-cut categories: 33 categories on specific topics, 3 categories on general grammar rules and 4 categories comprising lessons for children. Besides that, the app includes 5 specialized courses dedicated to professionals: Restaurant Staff, Hotel Receptionists, Shop Assistants, Flight attendants, Healthcare, all available in 33 languages.

 **Here are some of the benefits of learning a new language with Mondly:**

* state-of-the-art chatbot with speech recognition that will help you experience REAL conversations;
* exclusive Augmented Reality courses where a lifelike language learning assistant uses AR to make planets, animals and other virtual creations magically appear in your environment;
* flawless recordings recorded with native speakers (robots are cool, but we wouldn’t want you to cultivate your accent with theirs as an example);
* the possibility to learn the language you always wanted to learn from the language of your choice. While most language learning apps let you learn only from English, Mondly allows you to learn every language from 33 languages available inside the app.

 All these benefits in a beautifully designed app that will make learning a new language a piece of cake!
