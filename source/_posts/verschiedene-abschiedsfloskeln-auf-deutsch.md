## 1\. Auf Wiedersehen – ‘Goodbye’ in German

**_Auf Wiedersehen_ is the most popular way to say goodbye in German.** It’s standard and neutral, so it can be used safely in all formal social contexts or whenever you feel you shouldn’t use a casual goodbye.

 While Germans use it to say “goodbye”, it literally translates to “see you again”.

 Similarly,_Auf Wiederhören_ can be used at the end of a conversation that took place over the phone. It means “until we hear each other again”.

## 2\. Tschüss – ‘Bye’ in German

**_Tschüss_ is the most popular informal goodbye in German.** It’s short, sweet, and casual and you’ll usually hear it used among friends and family.

 Contrary to popular belief, Germans really like cute words, so they’ll also say_Tschüss Tschüss_ , which means “bye bye” or_Tschüssi_ , which is literally a “little goodbye”.

 Press play to hear_Tschüss_ in action in a basic conversation in German:

## 3\. Schönen Tag (noch) – ‘Have a good day’

 Now that you know the most popular ways of saying goodbye in German, it’s time to move on to some variations. These are perfect for those times when you feel like switching from “goodbye” to “see you later” or “have a good day”.

 One such variation is_Schönen Tag,_ which can be used with or without the_noch_ . It is a friendly way of wishing someone a good or a nice day!

 In the same manner, you’ll say_Schönes Wochenende_ to wish someone a good weekend.

## 4\. Einen schönen Tag noch – ‘Have a nice day’

 The more polite version of_Schönen Tag noch_ is_Einen schönen Tag noch_ . It means the same thing, but it is used by someone who wants to sound more formal and respectful.

## 5\. Ciao – ‘Bye’

 The same as the rest of Europe, Germans borrowed [_Ciao_](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) from the Italians. It’s a nice, friendly and very international way of parting ways with a friend.

 Just as chic, though not as common, is the French_Adieu_ or_Ade_ .

## 12\. Wir sehen uns dann – ‘See you then’

_Wir sehen uns_ is another nice way to say “see ya later” if you are making plans with someone. Add_dann_ to that and it will mean something more along the lines of “see you then”.

## 13\. Viel Spaß – ‘Have fun’ in German

 Supposing that the other person is going to a party or a similar activity, you can say_Viel Spaß_ , which means “enjoy” or “have fun”.

## 14\. Mach’s gut – ‘Take care’

 For more caring natures,_Mach’s gut_ is the perfect way to end a conversation. It is, of course, an informal way to say goodbye and it’s reserved for people with whom we have a special relationship.

## 15\. Lebewohl – ‘Farewell’

 Last of not least, if you want to sound dramatic or crack a joke, you can always say_Lebewohl_ , which literally means “live well” but is most commonly translated as “farewell”.

 Now, no matter which variation you choose, you’ll be able to confidently say goodbye in German.
