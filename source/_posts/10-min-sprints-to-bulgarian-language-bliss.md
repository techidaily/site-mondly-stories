## The Bulgarian language in the nutshell

 The [Bulgarian language](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bulgarian-language) is the official language of Bulgaria, one of the official languages of the European Union and a member of the Balkan sprachbund (together with the closely related Macedonian language).

 Its historical development can be divided into [several periods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian%5Flanguage) : the Prehistoric period (between circa 7th century CE and 860), Old Bulgarian, also known as “Old Church Slavonic” (9th to 11th centuries), Middle Bulgarian (12th to 15th centuries) and Modern Bulgarian from the 16th century onwards. During this time, the language underwent several dramatic changes that eventually shaped it to the Bulgarian we can all [learn today with Mondly](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5454&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5454?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=bg&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5454?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=bg) .

 Written in the Cyrillic alphabet and spoken in Bulgaria and parts of Romania, Moldova, Greece and Ukraine, Bulgarian was the first “Slavic” language attested in writing. Since Slavic linguistic unity lasted until late antiquity, the earliest manuscripts initially referred to this “the Slavic language”. Then, in the Middle Bulgarian period, the name was gradually replaced by ”the Bulgarian language“.

 When it comes to grammar and vocabulary, Bulgarian has several characteristics that set it apart from all other Slavic languages, the most notable being its almost complete loss of case declension in the noun and the development of a suffixed definite article. What does this mean? Well, the definite article is placed after the noun or adjective. For example, to say “table” in Bulgarian, you say_masa,_ and to say “the table” you say_masata_ . Additionally, the infinitive form of the verb is replaced with a clause, as in Romanian, modern Greek and Albanian.
