## 1\. Good morning in Spanish:_¡Buenos días!_

**_Buenos días_ literally means “good days”, but it is used to say “good morning” in Spanish.** Suitable for all social contexts, this greeting can be used with both friends and strangers. If you want to mix things up, you can also add_hola_ and say “hola, buenos días” as it is a very standard and friendly salutation. If you want to say goodbye in the morning, you can say “adiós, buenos días” which is a nice way to wish someone a good day.

 It is also important to note that in some countries from South America it’s common to say “buen día” which is literally the singular form of “buenos días”. However, if you go to Spain, it’s best to stick with “buenos días”.

## 2\. Good morning in French:_Bon matin !_

 **Remember this: in European French, there is no exact translation for the phrase “good morning”.** Therefore, in France, you should always use [“bonjour”](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) instead of “bon matin” if you want to “good morning” in French.

 On the other hand, in Quebec, “bon matin” is the preferred greeting usually until around 10 or 11 a.m.

 Both “bonjour” and “bon matin” are appropriate in both formal and informal settings and can be used with friends and strangers alike.

## 6\. Good morning in Russian:_Доброе утро!_

 To say [“good morning” in Russian](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) , you can use the phrase “доброе утро” which is pronounced “Dobroye utro”. This is the most popular way to greet people in the morning.

 Like all morning greetings on this list, “доброе утро” can safely be used in all kinds of social contexts with both friends and strangers.

 Additionally, if you want to go the extra mile, it is considered polite to ask about the person’s well-being after greeting them. For example, “как дела?”_(kak dela?)_ which means “how are you?” is often used in conjunction with “доброе утро”_(dobraye utro)_ . This makes the greeting more friendly and personal.

## 7\. Good morning in Chinese:_早上好！_

 早上好_(Zǎoshang hǎo)_ is how you normally say “good morning” in Chinese. However, if you want to keep it short and sound more like a native, you can just simply say 早_(zǎo)_ .

 The same as the English “good morning”, 早 (zǎo) can be used in most social settings provided it’s morning, of course.

## 8\. Good morning in Japanese:_おはようございます！_

 When greeting someone in the morning hours before 10:00 a.m. in Japanese, おはようございます_(Ohayōgozaimasu)_ is the most appropriate choice. It is considered more formal than こんにちは_(Konnichiwa)_ or “hello” and is safe to use with people you are not familiar with or in formal settings such as with your boss or teacher.

 In addition to being used as a way to say “hello”, おはようございます_(Ohayōgozaimasu)_ can also be used as a way to say “goodbye”.

## Bonus: Good morning in Romanian:_bună dimineața!_

 Easy enough! The most straightforward way to say “good morning” in Romanian is “bună dimineața”. While the diacritics may look weird, they are quite easy to pronounce. You will pronounce “ă” like “uh” or the last sound in the word “the”. “Ț”, on the other hand, is similar to the sound you make when you say “ts”.

 If you’re meeting a close friend and want to sound more like a native, you can just say “neața”.
