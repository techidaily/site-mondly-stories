## Bonus: Good morning in Romanian:_bună dimineața!_

 Easy enough! The most straightforward way to say “good morning” in Romanian is “bună dimineața”. While the diacritics may look weird, they are quite easy to pronounce. You will pronounce “ă” like “uh” or the last sound in the word “the”. “Ț”, on the other hand, is similar to the sound you make when you say “ts”.

 If you’re meeting a close friend and want to sound more like a native, you can just say “neața”.
