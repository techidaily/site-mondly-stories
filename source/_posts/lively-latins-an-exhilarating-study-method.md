## Lively Latins: An Exhilarating Study Method

 Going back to school may not be the same this year, but one thing stays the same: the “ordeal” most students have to go through to [learn Latin](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-5440&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5440?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=la&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-5440?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=la) .

## How I learned Latin like a pro (and how you can too!)

 I know your pain. I’ve been there too. I hated Latin when I was in high school. I could not see the point of learning a dead language.

 But then, in the 12th grade, our teacher retired and another young and dedicated Latin teacher replaced her. It was, of course, too late for me to become fluent in Latin in just one semester. But I learned a few things.

 First of all, I learned that I did not hate Latin. I later found out I was actually fascinated by it, but the previous teacher did not know how to properly teach and instil passion in me or my colleagues.

 Second of all, I also learned that Latin is not a dead language. On the contrary! Latin is very much alive in our everyday conversations._Carpe diem!_

 Finally, in addition to some actual Latin words, expressions and verb conjugations, I also learned that I should give Latin a second chance.

 And I did. Seven years later. Or better said – a few months ago when [**Mondly introduced a new Latin course**](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) that allowed me to enjoy learning Latin and even**speak Latin like a total pro.**

Here’s how.
