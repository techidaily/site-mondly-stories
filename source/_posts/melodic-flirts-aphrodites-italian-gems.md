## Melodic Flirts: Aphrodite’s Italian Gems

 Italian pick up lines are just like good old [English pick up lines](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) but with a twist: when delivered, they require much more passion and expressiveness. After all, that’s the Italian way. You don’t really speak Italian if you don’t use [gestures](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) . That is, if you’re not flirting through Tinder, Bumble or any other dating app. If that’s the case, you can rely solely on the charm of your written words to win hearts. Either way, the following list of Italian pick up lines are cheesy enough to work in both cases.

 Before we get on with it, one question remains: are Italians as romantic as they are depicted in popular culture? Well, in a way, yes. Italian men are quite often passionate and romantic, but Italian women are usually not too fond of excessive sweetness from strangers. However, they do love a good joke. And that’s exactly where pick up lines come in!

 _Roses are red; violets are blue, we made this**Italian pick up lines** list only for you._ 😏

## Funny Pick Up Lines in Italian

* _Eccomi, scusa per il ritardo, è molto che mi aspetti?_ (“Here I am, sorry I’m late, have you been waiting long?”)
* _Sto scrivendo un libro di numeri telefonici. Potresti darmi il tuo?_ (“I’m writing a book about phone numbers. Can I please have yours?”)
* _Ho perso il mio numero di telefono, potresti prestarmi il tuo?_ (“I lost my phone number; can I borrow yours?”)
* _Credi nell’amore a prima vista o devo passare di nuovo?_ (“Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk by again?”)
* _Mi fai sciogliere come il gelato al sole._ (“You make me melt like ice cream in the sun.”)
