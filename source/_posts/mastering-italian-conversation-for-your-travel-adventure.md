 Oh, Italy! The land of Romeo and Juliet, the land of incredible museums, breathtaking coastal cities, of yummy pasta and pizza, the land you must visit at least once in your life. Yep, that is Italy! A dream of love. And to enjoy it to the fullest, you must explore at least a tiny bit of its beautiful language –_la lingua Italiana_ (“the Italian language”). Because nothing is as genuine as a traveling experience where you’re talking to the locals in their mother tongue. Therefore, let’s help you get ready for your Italian trip with these 100+**Italian phrases** every traveler needs to know.

[Italian greetings](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) should always be on top of your list of priorities when packing your bags for a trip to Italy. The Italian culture places a big emphasis on greetings, introductions, and respect towards the elders. Do you remember [_Il Padrino_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/) (“The Godfather”)? Well, that scenario wasn’t entirely fictitious. In many cultures around the world,_gli anziani della famiglia_ (“the elders of the family”) are regarded as wise heads of the family responsible for taking the most important decisions. So here are the most important**Italian greetings** you should know as a traveler:

* Good morning! –_Buongiorno!_
* Good afternoon! –_Buon pomeriggio!_
* Good evening! –_Buonasera!_
* Good night! –_Buonanotte!_
