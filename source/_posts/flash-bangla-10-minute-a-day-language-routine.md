 Also known as Bangla (বাংলা), the Bengali language is the official and most spoken language in Bangladesh and the second most spoken of the 22 scheduled languages of India.

 Bengali has developed over the course of more than 1,300 years and its literature is one of the most prolific and diverse literary traditions in Asia.

 To read or write in Bengali, you’ll have to learn the [Bengali alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali%5Falphabet) or the Bengali script, the fifth most widely used writing system in the world. Written from left to right and with no distinct letter cases, the Bengali script has a total of 50 letters, 11 vowels and 39 consonants. Don’t worry though ![Mondly](https://app.adjust.io/5ixfg4k?campaign=blog-post-id-4530&fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-4530?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=bn&redirect%5Fandroid=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.atistudios.mondly.languages&redirect%5Fios=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid987873536&redirect%5Fmacos=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mondly.com?avangate%5Fsrc=blog-post-id-4530?mother%5Flang=en%5Fus?target%5Flang=bn) uses a unique set of lessons based on a contextually rich environment that will help you make the connections yourself and learn Bengali naturally.

**Fun fact:** The Bengali [language movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali%5Flanguage%5Fmovement) (1948 – 1956) demanding Bengali to be an official language of the then-Dominion of Pakistan fostered Bengali nationalism in East Bengal and lead to the independence of Bangladesh in 1971\. In 1999, in recognition of this political language movement, UNESCO recognized 21 February as [International Mother Language Day](https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https://www.mondly.com?AFFILIATE=108875) .
