### **Heightened Cognitive Ability**

In addition, bilinguals are predisposed to enjoy better cognitive skills. At school, students speaking another language perform better in academic tests. Their brain is kept active, alert and sharp to strike a balance when handling different tasks.

### **Improved Health**

The process of learning a second language holds back age-related deteriorating diseases. Bilinguals are less likely to develop dementia and Alzheimer’s disease earlier in life than monolinguals. People who know a second language are also bound to experience low stress levels and better neurological health.

There you have it! Above are some of the benefits of being bilingual. Bilingualism comes with many rewards that can give you an edge in modern society. Speaking a second language places you on top of the chain in this society, above those who are monolinguals.
